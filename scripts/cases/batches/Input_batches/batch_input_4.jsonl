The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 8 Dec 2022, C-460/20 (\nGoogle\n)\nCharter of fundamental rights of the EU \n >

The corporate purpose of G-LLC is, according to its own statement, \u2018to contribute consistently towards fraud prevention in the economy and society by means of active investigation and constant transparency\u2019. Various publications criticised G-LLC\u2019s business model, in particular accusing it of attempting to \u2018blackmail\u2019 companies by first publishing negative reports regarding those companies and then offering to delete them or prevent their publication, in exchange for a sum of money.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google displayed the articles of 4\u00a0June 2015 and 16\u00a0June 2015 when the names and forenames of the applicants in the main proceedings, both on their own and in conjunction with certain company names, were entered in its search engine, as well as the 27\u00a0April 2015 article when certain company names were entered, and included a link to those articles. In addition, when an image search was conducted on that search engine, Google displayed in the list of results, in the form of thumbnails, the photographs of the applicants in the main proceedings contained in the article of 4\u00a0June 2015. Those photographs ceased being displayed in September 2017, at the latest. The articles ceased to be accessible on the g-net website from 28\u00a0June 2018 at the latest.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicants in the main proceedings requested Google, as the controller of personal data processed by its search engine, first, to de-reference the links to the articles at issue in the main proceedings from the list of search results, on the ground that they contained inaccurate claims and defamatory opinions, and, second, to remove the thumbnails from the list of search results. They also claimed to have been victims of \u2018blackmail\u2019 by G-LLC.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google refused to comply with that request, referring to the professional context in which the articles and photographs at issue in the main proceedings were set and arguing that it was unaware of the alleged inaccuracy of the information contained in those articles.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2015, the applicants in the main proceedings brought an action before the Landgericht K\u00f6ln (Regional Court, Cologne, Germany) seeking an order requiring Google to de-reference the links to the articles at issue in the main proceedings from its lists of search results and to put an end to the display, in the form of thumbnails, of the photographs representing them. By judgment of 22\u00a0November 2017, that court dismissed the action.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicants in the main proceedings lodged an appeal against that judgment before the Oberlandesgericht K\u00f6ln (Higher Regional Court, Cologne, Germany). That appeal was dismissed by judgment of 8\u00a0November 2018. That court stated that the specific method of functioning of a search engine and the particular importance it has for the functioning of the internet must be accorded particular importance in the context of the weighing-up of competing rights and interests which is to be undertaken. Given that the operator of the search engine generally has no legal relationship with those providing the content shown, and given that it is impossible for that operator to investigate the facts and assess them while also taking account of the opinions of those providers, the operator of the search engine is subject to specific obligations to act only when it becomes aware, following a specific notification from the data subject, of a prima facie flagrant and clearly discernible infringement of the law. Those principles also apply where the search engine is used solely to search for images, given that the relevant interests involved are comparable.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The appeal court added that, in so far as it is necessary conclusively to take account of the accuracy of the alleged fact, the burden of proof in that regard lies with the person requesting the de-referencing. In the present case, since the applicants in the main proceedings have not proven that the facts reported in relation to them are inaccurate, Google is unable to carry out a final assessment of the articles at issue in the main proceedings and, consequently, is not required to de-reference them. As regards the photographs displayed in the form of thumbnails, they could, in so far as they accompany one of those articles, be regarded as being news images.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicants in the main proceedings brought an appeal on a point of law before the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice, Germany), the referring court.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court observes that the outcome of that action depends on the interpretation of EU law, in particular Article\u00a017(3)(a) of the GDPR and Article\u00a012(b) and point (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, the referring court states that, from its point of view, the request that Google be ordered to de-reference the links to the articles at issue in the main proceedings from the list of search results falls ratione temporis within the scope of the GDPR, whereas the request that Google be ordered to remove the thumbnails from the list of results of an image search falls ratione temporis within the scope of Directive 95/46, given that those thumbnails were no longer displayed by the search engine operated by Google on the date when the GDPR entered into force. However, as regards the request to have the thumbnails removed, the referring court requests the Court to provide an answer on that point which also takes account of that regulation.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court then observes that the fact that the articles at issue in the main proceedings are no longer available on the g-net website and that Google no longer displays the thumbnails has not eliminated the interest the applicants in the main proceedings have in pursuing their request for de-referencing, given that the g-net website merely states that, for various reasons, those articles are \u2018currently\u2019 unavailable. In those circumstances, it cannot be ruled out that those articles may be re-posted online in the future and may once more be referenced by Google\u2019s search engine, since it is noted, moreover, that Google continues to take the view that that request for de-referencing is unjustified and Google continues to refuse to accede to it.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the substance, concerning, in the first place, the request for de-referencing of the links to the articles at issue in the main proceedings from the list of search results, the referring court notes that the applicants in the main proceedings justify that request by claiming, in particular, that some of the assertions in those articles are inaccurate. The question therefore arises as to whether it was for the applicants in the main proceedings to prove the alleged inaccuracy of those assertions or, at the very least, to furnish a certain degree of evidence of that inaccuracy or whether, on the contrary, Google ought either to have presumed that the claims of the applicants in the main proceedings were accurate or to have sought to clarify the facts itself.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, the requirement to strike an equal balance between competing fundamental rights arising from Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, on the one hand, and Articles\u00a011 and 16 of the Charter, on the other, is not satisfied if, in a situation such as that at issue in the case in the main proceedings, the burden of proof falls exclusively on one party or the other.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, that court proposes adopting a solution which seeks to require the data subject to resolve, at least provisionally, the question of the accuracy of the referenced content by pursuing in court his or her claim against the content provider, in so far as obtaining judicial protection at least provisionally is a reasonable option for the data subject taking account of the circumstances of the particular case. It is true that, in so far as it has no relationship with the content provider, the data subject could encounter the same difficulties as the operator of the search in making contact with the content provider. However, the data subject knows whether the referenced content is accurate or not. The question whether that data subject may reasonably be required to pursue in court his or her claim against the content supplier could depend, for example, on whether or not the content provider can be approached without particular difficulty within the European Union.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the referring court suggests that, as a general rule, the data subject may reasonably be required to bring an action for interim relief against a content supplier whose name is known, but not against an anonymous provider or a provider to whom it is impossible to make notifications. However, the actual likelihood of obtaining enforcement of any order against the content provider requiring erasure is irrelevant as regards the rights vis-\u00e0-vis the operator of the search engine.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards the request that Google be ordered to put an end to the display, in the form of thumbnails, of the photographs of the applicants in the main proceedings contained in the 4\u00a0June 2015 article, the referring court observes, first of all, that those thumbnails do indeed contain a link allowing access to the third party\u2019s internet page on which the corresponding photograph was published and thereby to become aware of the context of that publication. However, in so far as the list of results of an image search displays only thumbnails, without reproducing information regarding the context of that publication on the third party\u2019s internet page, that list is, in itself, neutral and does not make it possible to ascertain the context surrounding the original publication.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the question arises whether, when conducting the weighing-up exercise under Article\u00a012(b) and point (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 or Article\u00a017(3)(a) of the GDPR, account must be taken solely of the thumbnail as such in the neutral context of the list of results or whether account must also be taken of the original context of the publication of the corresponding image.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring court notes that, in the case in the main proceedings, which concerns persons who are not known to the general public, the photographs in question do not, in themselves, contribute to public debate and do not satisfy a compelling need for information in accordance with the provisions referred to in the preceding paragraph. However, in connection with the 4\u00a0June 2015 article published on the g-net website, the photographs play an important role in substantiating the message contained in that article, which is that the applicants in the main proceedings, by virtue of their position as founders and managers of the fourth company and of the group of companies referred to in paragraph\u00a015 of the present judgment, enjoy a high standard of living and possess luxury goods, whilst the employees, distributors and customers of those companies are uncertain as to the safety of the investments made. Consequently, if account ought to be taken of the context in which those photographs were initially published, their publication as thumbnails in the list of results would have to be regarded as justified, provided that the text accompanying them is itself lawful.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, one factor militating in favour of taking account of the context of the original publication lies in the fact that, technically, thumbnails constitute links referring to the third party\u2019s internet page. Similarly, it is well known that the informed average user of an image search engine is aware of the fact that the thumbnails brought together by the search engine in a list of results are taken from third party publications and that the photographs corresponding to those thumbnails are displayed, in those publications, in a particular context.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, account should be taken of the fact that the original context of the publication of the images is neither stated nor otherwise visible when the thumbnail is displayed, unlike in the case of other referenced results. A user who, from the outset, is interested only in displaying the image has, as a general rule, no reason to seek out the source and the original context of the publication.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, it therefore appears logical, for the purposes of assessing the lawfulness of the data processing by the search engine data controller concerned, to include in the weighing-up exercise referred to in point (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 or Article\u00a017(3) of the GDPR only the rights and interests which are apparent from the thumbnail itself.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it compatible with the data subject\u2019s right to respect for private life (Article\u00a07 of the [Charter]) and to protection of personal data (Article\u00a08 of the Charter) if, within the context of the weighing-up of conflicting rights and interests arising from Articles\u00a07, 8, 11 and 16 of the Charter, within the scope of the examination of his [or her] request for de-referencing brought against the data controller of an internet search engine, pursuant to Article\u00a017(3)(a) of [the GDPR], when the link, the de-referencing of which [that person] is requesting, leads to content that includes factual claims and value judgments based on factual claims the truth of which is denied by the data subject, and the lawfulness of which depends on the question of the extent to which the factual claims contained in that content are true, the national court also concentrates conclusively on the issue of whether the data subject could reasonably seek legal protection against the content provider, for instance by means of interim relief, and thus at least provisional clarification on the question of the truth of the content displayed by the search engine data controller could be provided?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case of a request for de-referencing made against the data controller of an internet search engine, which in a name search searches for photos of natural persons which third parties have introduced into the internet in connection with the person\u2019s name, and which displays the photos which it has found in its search results as preview images (thumbnails), within the context of the weighing-up of the conflicting rights and interests arising from Articles\u00a07, 8, 11 and 16 of the Charter pursuant to Article\u00a012(b) and [point (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014] of Directive [95/46 or] Article\u00a017(3)(a) of [the GDPR], should the context of the original third-party publication be conclusively taken into account, even if the third-party website is linked by the search engine when the preview image is displayed but is not specifically named, and the resulting context is not shown with it by the internet search engine?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google expresses doubts as to whether the first question is admissible, on the ground that the problem which it raises is hypothetical in nature. In particular, the solution suggested by the referring court takes the form of an abstract construction which is unrelated to the facts at issue in the case in the main proceedings. In its view, the Court also does not have the necessary material to provide a useful answer to that question.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, according to settled case-law, in the context of the cooperation between the Court and the national courts provided for in Article\u00a0267 TFEU, it is solely for the national court before which a dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, where the questions submitted by the national court concern the interpretation of EU law, the Court of Justice is, in principle, bound to give a ruling (judgment of 15\u00a0July 2021, \nThe Department for Communities in Northern Ireland\n, C-709/20, EU:C:2021:602, paragraph\u00a054 and the case-law cited).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court for a preliminary ruling only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 15\u00a0July 2021, \nThe Department for Communities in Northern Ireland\n, C-709/20, EU:C:2021:602, paragraph\u00a055 and the case-law cited).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a022 of his Opinion, the referring court has provided a sufficiently precise and comprehensive picture of the factual and legal context underlying the dispute in the main proceedings and has sufficiently substantiated the need, in that context, to obtain an answer to the question submitted.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it should be pointed out that the processing of personal data carried out in the context of the activity of a search engine can be distinguished from and is additional to that carried out by publishers of websites, consisting in loading those data on an internet page (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a035). Where the data subject brings an action against the operator of the search engine, the rights, interests and restrictions involved are not, therefore, necessarily the same as in the context of an action brought against a content provider, with the result that a specific weighing-up exercise for the purposes of examining a request for de-referencing under Article\u00a017 of the GDPR is necessary.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the considerations set out by the referring court that the Court\u2019s answer to the question concerning, first, the extent of the obligations and responsibilities incumbent on the operator of a search engine in processing a request for de-referencing based on the alleged inaccuracy of the information in the referenced content and, second, the burden of proof imposed on the data subject as regards that inaccuracy is capable of having a direct impact on the assessment, by the referring court, of the action in the main proceedings, regardless of whether the applicants in the main proceedings are in a position to obtain effective judicial protection as against the content provider concerning publication on the internet of the allegedly inaccurate content.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a022 of his Opinion, the fact that the referring court\u2019s questions regarding the methodology which it considers to be applicable in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings are expressed in general and abstract terms does not mean that the question referred to the Court in that regard is hypothetical.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the first question is admissible.\n\u00a0\nSubstance\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a017(3)(a) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, within the context of the weighing-up exercise which is to be undertaken between the rights referred to in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, on the one hand, and those referred to in Articles\u00a011 and 16 of the Charter, on the other hand, for the purposes of examining a request for de-referencing made to the operator of a search engine seeking the removal of a link to content containing claims which the person who submitted the request regards as inaccurate from the list of search results, that de-referencing is subject to the condition that the question of the accuracy of the referenced content has been resolved, at least provisionally, in an action brought by that person against the provider of that content, where there is a reasonable possibility of obtaining such judicial protection.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it must be recalled, first, that the activity of a search engine consisting in finding information published or placed on the internet by third parties, indexing it automatically, storing it temporarily and, finally, making it available to internet users according to a particular order of preference must be classified as \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 and points\u00a01 and 2 of Article\u00a04 of the GDPR when that information contains personal data and, second, that the operator of the search engine must be regarded as the \u2018controller\u2019 in respect of that processing within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of that directive and Article\u00a04(7) of that regulation (see, to that effect, judgments of 13\u00a0May 2014,\n Google Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a041, and of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a035).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, as recalled in paragraph\u00a044 of the present judgment, the processing of personal data carried out in the context of the activity of a search engine can be distinguished from and is additional to that carried out by publishers of websites, consisting in loading those data on an internet page. In addition, that activity plays a decisive role in the overall dissemination of those data in that it renders the latter accessible to any internet user making a search on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name, including to internet users who otherwise would not have found the internet page on which those data are published. Also, the organisation and aggregation of information published on the internet that are effected by search engines with the aim of facilitating their users\u2019 access to that information may, when users carry out their search on the basis of an individual\u2019s name, result in them obtaining through the list of results a structured overview of the information relating to that individual that can be found on the internet enabling them to establish a more or less detailed profile of the data subject (see, to that effect, judgments of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraphs\u00a036 and 37, and of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a036).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, inasmuch as the activity of a search engine is liable to affect significantly, and additionally compared with that of the publishers of websites, the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data, the operator of the search engine as the person determining the purposes and means of that activity must ensure, within the framework of its responsibilities, powers and capabilities, that the activity meets the requirements of Directive 95/46 and of the GDPR in order that the guarantees laid down by that directive and that regulation may have full effect and that effective and complete protection of data subjects, in particular of their right to privacy, may actually be achieved (see, to that effect, judgments of 13\u00a0May 2014,\n Google Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a038, and of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a037).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the extent of the responsibility and specific obligations of the operator of a search engine, the Court has already stated that that operator is responsible not because personal data appear on an internet page published by a third party, but because of the referencing of that page and, in particular, the display of the link to that internet page in the list of results presented to internet users following a search carried out on the basis of an individual\u2019s name, since such a display of the link in such a list is liable significantly to affect the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of the personal data relating to him or her (see, to that effect, judgments of 13\u00a0May 2014,\n Google Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a080, and of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a046).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, having regard to the responsibilities, powers and capabilities of the operator of a search engine as the controller of the processing carried out in connection with the activity of the search engine, the prohibitions and restrictions laid down by Directive 95/46 and by the GDPR can apply to that operator only by reason of that referencing and thus via a verification, under the supervision of the competent national authorities, on the basis of a request by the data subject (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n (C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a047).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards such a request, the GDPR contains, in Article\u00a017, a provision which specifically governs the \u2018right to erasure\u2019, also known as the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019. Although paragraph\u00a01 of that article provides that the data subject has, in principle, for the reasons listed therein, the right to obtain the erasure of personal data relating to him or her by the controller, it states, in paragraph\u00a03, that that right may not be relied on where the processing in question is necessary on account of one of the grounds listed, which include, in Article\u00a017(3)(a), exercising the right relating, in particular, to freedom of information.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the operator of a search engine who receives a request for de-referencing must ascertain whether the inclusion of the link to the internet page in question in the list displayed following a search carried out on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name is necessary for exercising the right to freedom of information of internet users potentially interested in accessing that internet page by means of a search, a right protected by Article\u00a011 of the Charter (see, by analogy, judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019,\n GC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n (C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a066).\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that Article\u00a017(3)(a) of the GDPR expressly provides that the data subject\u2019s right to erasure is excluded where processing is necessary for the exercise of the right of information, guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter, is an expression of the fact that the right to protection of personal data is not an absolute right but, as recital\u00a04 of the regulation states, must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data), \n C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a057 and the case-law cited).\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should be recalled that Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter accepts that limitations may be imposed on the exercise of rights such as those set forth in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, as long as the limitations are provided for by law, respect the essence of those rights and freedoms and, subject to the principle of proportionality, are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others (judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a058 and the case-law cited).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The GDPR, and in particular Article\u00a017(3)(a), thus expressly lays down the requirement to strike a balance between the fundamental rights to privacy and protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, on the one hand, and the fundamental right of freedom of information guaranteed by Article\u00a011 of the Charter, on the other (judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a059).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be added that Article\u00a07 of the Charter, regarding the right to respect for private and family life, contains rights corresponding to those guaranteed in Article\u00a08(1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950 (\u2018the ECHR\u2019), and that the protection of personal data is of fundamental importance to a person\u2019s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life, as guaranteed by Article\u00a08 of the ECHR (ECtHR, 27\u00a0June 2017,\n Satakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi oy and satamedia oy v. Finland\n, CE:ECHR:2017:0627JUD000093113, \u00a7\u00a0137). In accordance with Article\u00a052(3) of the Charter, Article\u00a07 of the Charter is thus to be given the same meaning and the same scope as Article\u00a08(1) ECHR, as interpreted by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. The same is true of Article\u00a011 of the Charter and Article\u00a010 ECHR (see to that effect, judgment of 14\u00a0February 2019, \nBuivids\n, (C-345/17, EU:C:2019:122, paragraph\u00a065 and the case-law cited).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights that, as regards the publication of data, for the purposes of striking a balance between the right to respect for private life and the right of freedom of expression and information, a number of relevant criteria must be taken into consideration, such as contribution to a debate of public interest, the degree of notoriety of the person affected, the subject of the news report, the prior conduct of the person concerned, the content, the form and consequences of the publication, the manner and circumstances in which the information was obtained as well and its veracity (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 27\u00a0June 2017,\n Satakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v. Finland\n, CE:ECHR:2017:0627JUD000093113, \u00a7\u00a0165).\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is in the light of those considerations that an examination must be made of the conditions in which the operator of a search engine is required to accede to a request for de-referencing and thus to remove from the list of results displayed following a search on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name, the link to an internet page on which that personal data specific to that person appear, on the ground that the referenced content contains claims which that person regards as inaccurate (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n (C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a060).\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted, first of all, that, while the data subject\u2019s rights protected by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter override, as a general rule, the legitimate interest of internet users who may be interested in accessing the information in question, that balance may, however, depend on the relevant circumstances of each case, in particular on the nature of that information and its sensitivity for the data subject\u2019s private life and on the interest of the public in having that information, an interest which may vary, in particular, according to the role played by the data subject in public life (judgments of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a081, and of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a066).\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, where the data subject plays a role in public life, that person must display a greater degree of tolerance, since he or she is inevitably and knowingly exposed to public scrutiny (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 6\u00a0October 2022, \nKhural and Zeynalov v. Azerbaijan\n, CE:ECHR:2022:1006JUD005506911, \u00a7\u00a041 and the case-law cited).\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question of whether or not the referenced content is accurate also constitutes a relevant factor when assessing the conditions for application laid down in Article\u00a017(3)(a) of the GDPR, for the purpose of assessing whether the right of internet users to information and the content provider\u2019s freedom of expression may override the rights of the person requesting de-referencing.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, and as stated, in essence, by the Advocate General in point\u00a030 of his Opinion, while, in certain circumstances, the right to freedom of expression and information may override the rights to private life and to protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject plays a role in public life, that relationship is in any event reversed where, at the very least, a part\u00a0\u2013 which is not minor in relation to the content as a whole\u00a0\u2013 of the information referred to in the request for de-referencing proves to be inaccurate. In such a situation, the right to inform and the right to be informed cannot be taken into account, since they cannot include the right to disseminate and have access to such information.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be added that, while the issue of whether or not the assertions in the referenced content are accurate is relevant for the application of Article\u00a017(3)(a) of the GDPR, a distinction must be drawn between factual assertions and value judgements. While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 23\u00a0April 2015, \nMorice v. France\n, CE:ECHR:2015:0423JUD002936910, \u00a7\u00a0126).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, it is necessary to determine, first, whether, and if so to what extent, it is for the person who has submitted the request for de-referencing to provide evidence to support his or her claim relating to the inaccuracy of the information in the referenced content and, second, whether the operator of the search engine must seek to clarify the facts itself in order to establish whether the allegedly inaccurate information is or is not accurate.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the first place, the obligations of the person requesting de-referencing on account of the referenced content being inaccurate, it is for that person to establish the manifest inaccuracy of the information found in that content or, at the very least, of a part\u00a0\u2013 which is not minor in relation to the content as a whole\u00a0\u2013 of that information. However, in order to avoid imposing on that person an excessive burden which is liable to undermine the practical effect of the right to de-referencing, that person has to provide only evidence that, in the light of the circumstances of the particular case, can reasonably be required of him or her to try to find in order to establish that manifest inaccuracy. In that regard, that person cannot be required, in principle, to produce, as from the pre-litigation stage, in support of his or her request for de-referencing made to the operator of the search engine, a judicial decision made against the publisher of the website in question, even in the form of a decision given in interim proceedings. To impose such an obligation on that person would have the effect of imposing an unreasonable burden on him or her.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the second place, the obligations and responsibilities incumbent on the operator of the search engine, it is true that the operator of the search engine must, in order to determine whether content may continue to be included in the list of search results carried out using its search engine following a request for de-referencing, take into account all the rights and interests involved and all the circumstances of the case.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, when assessing the conditions for application laid down in Article\u00a017(3)(a) of the GDPR, that operator cannot be required to play an active role in trying to find facts which are not substantiated by the request for de-referencing, for the purposes of determining whether that request is well founded.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, when such a request is processed, the operator of the search engine concerned cannot be required to investigate the facts and, to that end, to organise an adversarial debate with the content provider seeking to obtain missing information concerning the accuracy of the referenced content. In so far as it would require the operator of the search engine to contribute to establishing itself whether or not the referenced content is accurate, such an obligation would impose on that operator a burden in excess of what can reasonably be expected of it in the light of its responsibilities, powers and capabilities, within the meaning of the case-law referred to in paragraph\u00a053 of the present judgment. That obligation would thereby entail a serious risk that content meeting the public\u2019s legitimate and compelling need for information would be de-referenced and would thereby become difficult to find on the internet. In that regard, there would be a real risk of a deterrent effect on the exercise of freedom of expression and of information if the operator of the search engine undertook such a de-referencing exercise quasi-systematically, in order to avoid having to bear the burden of investigating the relevant facts for the purpose of establishing whether or not the referenced content was accurate.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, where the person who has made a request for de-referencing submits relevant and sufficient evidence capable of substantiating his or her request and of establishing the manifest inaccuracy of the information found in the referenced content or, at the very least, of a part\u00a0\u2013 which is not minor in relation to the content as a whole\u00a0\u2013 of that information, the operator of the search engine is required to accede to that request for de-referencing. The same applies where the data subject submits a judicial decision made against the publisher of the website, which is based on the finding that information found in the referenced content\u00a0\u2013 which is not minor in relation to that content as a whole\u00a0\u2013 is, at least prima facie, inaccurate.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, where the inaccuracy of such information found in the referenced content is not obvious, in the light of the evidence provided by the data subject, the operator of the search engine is not required, where there is no such judicial decision, to accede to such a request for de-referencing. Where the information in question is likely to contribute to a debate of public interest, it is appropriate, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, to place particular importance on the right to freedom of expression and of information.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be added that, in accordance with what has been stated in paragraph\u00a065 of the present judgment, it would also be disproportionate to de-reference articles, with the result that accessing all of them on the internet would be difficult, in a situation where only certain information of minor importance, in relation to the content found in those articles as a whole, proves to be inaccurate.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, it must be stated that, where the operator of a search engine does not grant the request for de-referencing, the data subject must be able to bring the matter before the supervisory authority or the judicial authority so that it carries out the necessary checks and orders that controller to adopt the necessary measures (see, to that effect, judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n (C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a077). It is, in particular, for the judicial authorities to ensure a balance is struck between competing interests, since they are best placed to carry out a complex and detailed balancing exercise, which takes account of all the criteria and all the factors established by the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice and of the European Court of Human Rights.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, where administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the alleged inaccuracy of information found in referenced content are initiated and where the existence of those proceedings has been brought to the attention of the operator of the search engine concerned, it is for that operator, for the purposes, inter alia, of providing internet users with information which continues to be relevant and up-to-date, to add to the search results a warning concerning the existence of such proceedings.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a017(3)(a) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, within the context of the weighing-up exercise which is to be undertaken between the rights referred to in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, on the one hand, and those referred to in Article\u00a011 of the Charter, on the other hand, for the purposes of examining a request for de-referencing made to the operator of a search engine seeking the removal of a link to content containing claims which the person who submitted the request regards as inaccurate from the list of search results, that de-referencing is not subject to the condition that the question of the accuracy of the referenced content has been resolved, at least provisionally, in an action brought by that person against the content provider.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n\u00a0\nThe applicable law ratione temporis\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court requests an interpretation of Article\u00a012(b) and point (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 as well as of Article\u00a017(3)(a) of the GDPR. It states, in that regard, that, while the request to have Google de-reference, on a long-term basis, the links to the articles at issue in the main proceedings falls ratione temporis within the scope of the GDPR, the request that Google put an end to the display, in the form of thumbnails, of photographs of the applicants in the main proceedings contained in the 4\u00a0June 2015 article falls ratione temporis within the scope of Directive 95/46, given that those photographs, unlike the links, were no longer displayed by the search engine operated by Google on the date when the GDPR entered into force.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, there is no need to distinguish between the provisions of Directive 95/46 and those of the GDPR referred to in the second question referred for a preliminary ruling, since the scope of all of those provisions must be regarded as similar for the purposes of the interpretation which the Court is required to give in the present case (see, by analogy, judgment of 1\u00a0August 2022, \nVyriausioji tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija\n, C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601, paragraph\u00a058 and the case-law cited).\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, in order to provide useful answers to the second question, it must be examined from the perspective of both Directive 95/46 and the GDPR.\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google also expresses doubts as to whether the second question is admissible, on the ground that the problem which it raises is hypothetical. First of all, Google takes the view that the subject matter of the dispute in the main proceedings is not a request to de-reference the results of an image search carried out on the basis of the names of the applicants in the main proceedings, but rather a general prohibition on displaying thumbnails corresponding to photographs illustrating one of the three articles at issue in the main proceedings. Next, Google argues that the thumbnails have not been available on the g-net website since September 2017 and the articles since 28\u00a0June 2018. Lastly, Google states that it introduced a new version of its image search engine as from 2018, in which the abbreviated title of the internet page specifically referenced and the internet address or a part of it are displayed on the results page under each thumbnail in the form of an additional link.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to the principles identified by the case-law of the Court referred to in paragraphs\u00a041 and 42 of the present judgment, it must be stated, first of all, that, in the present case, it is not obvious from the file before the Court that the interpretation of the provisions of Directive 95/46 and the GDPR, as sought by the referring court in the context of the assessment of the substance of the request seeking to have the display of the photographs brought to an end, bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in particular, the fact that the photographs and articles at issue in the main proceedings no longer appear on the g-net website, it is important to note, as the referring court has observed, that the removal of that content appears to be merely temporary, as shown by the statement on the g-net website that it is \u2018currently\u2019 impossible to access those articles. In those circumstances, it cannot be ruled out that those articles may be re-posted online in the future and may once again be referenced by Google\u2019s search engine. That is all the more so since Google continues to take the view that the request for de-referencing at issue in the main proceedings is unjustified and since Google continues to refuse to accede to that request.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the interest in a response from the Court concerning the interpretation of the relevant provisions of Directive 95/46 and of the GDPR, in the context of the request seeking to have brought to an end the display, in the form of thumbnails, of the photographs at issue in the case in the main proceedings, cannot be called into question either by the fact, relied on by Google, that the applicants in the main proceedings have not limited their request to searches on the basis of their names, or by the fact that Google has introduced a new version of its image search engine in which the abbreviated title of the internet page specifically referenced and the internet address or a part of it are displayed on the results page under each thumbnail in the form of an additional link.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, even if the request of the applicants in the main proceedings to bring to an end the display, in the form of thumbnails, of the photographs representing them were not limited to searches carried out on the basis of their names, the fact remains that that request covers a display resulting from such searches. In those circumstances, it cannot be held that the interpretation sought by virtue of the second question clearly bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as regards the introduction in the image search of an additional link showing the internet page on which they were originally published, in accordance with the settled case-law of the Court, it is for the national courts to establish the facts on the basis of which the dispute in the main proceedings must be resolved and to decide the extent to which subsequent developments in the search engine concerned are relevant in that regard.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the second question is admissible.\n\u00a0\nSubstance\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a012(b) and point (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 as well as Article\u00a017(3)(a) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of the weighing-up exercise which is to be undertaken between the rights referred to in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, on the one hand, and those referred to in Articles\u00a011 and 16 of the Charter, on the other hand, for the purposes of examining a request for de-referencing made to the operator of a search engine seeking the removal from the results of an image search carried out on the basis of the name of a natural person of photographs displayed in the form of thumbnails representing that person, the original context of the publication of those photographs on the internet must be conclusively taken into account.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That question thereby referred to the Court involves a request which seeks the removal of the photographs displayed in the form of thumbnails, which illustrated the article published on the g-net website on 4\u00a0June 2015, from the results of the image search carried out on the basis of the names of the applicants in the main proceedings. In that regard, the referring court seeks, in particular, to ascertain whether, for the purposes of assessing whether that request is well founded, account should be taken solely of the informative value of the thumbnails as such, in the neutral context of the list of results, or whether regard must also be had to the original context of the publication of the photographs, which is not apparent solely from the display of thumbnails in the context of the list of results.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted, as the Advocate General did in point\u00a053 of his Opinion, that image searches carried out by means of an internet search engine on the basis of a person\u2019s name are subject to the same principles as those which apply to internet page searches and the information contained in them. The Court\u2019s case-law referred to in paragraphs\u00a049 to 61 of the present judgment therefore also applies to the processing of a request for de-referencing which seeks the removal of photographs displayed in the form of thumbnails from the results of an image search.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is important to state, first of all, that the display, in the results of an image search, of photographs of natural persons in the form of thumbnails constitutes processing of personal data in respect of which the operator of the search engine concerned, as \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR, must, within the framework of its responsibilities, powers and capabilities, ensure compliance with the requirements contained in those provisions. \n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, it should be noted that the question referred concerns the specific method of searching for images offered by certain search engines, such as the search engine at issue in the main proceedings, by means of which internet users can search for information of any kind which takes the form of graphic content (photographs, representations of paintings, designs, graphs, tables, and so forth). When conducting such a search, the search engine generates a list of results consisting of thumbnails providing a link to internet pages containing both the search terms used and the graphic content set out in that list.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it has been held that, since the inclusion in the list of results, displayed following a search made on the basis of a person\u2019s name, of an internet page and of the information contained on it relating to that person makes access to that information appreciably easier for any internet user making a search in respect of that person and may play a decisive role in the dissemination of that information, it is liable to constitute a more significant interference with the data subject\u2019s fundamental right to privacy than the publication on the internet page (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a087).\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is all the more so where, following a search by name, photographs of the data subject are displayed in the form of thumbnails, that display being such as to constitute a particularly significant interference with the data subject\u2019s rights to private life and that person\u2019s personal data referred to in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A person\u2019s image constitutes one of the chief attributes of his or her personality as it reveals the person\u2019s unique characteristics and distinguishes the person from others. The right to the protection of one\u2019s image is thus one of the essential components of personal development and mainly presupposes that person\u2019s control over the use of that image, including the right to refuse publication of it. It follows that, while freedom of expression and of information undoubtedly includes the publication of photographs, the protection of the right to privacy takes on particular importance in that context since photographs are capable of conveying particularly personal or even intimate information about an individual or his or her family (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 7\u00a0February 2012, \nVon Hannover v. Germany\n, CE:ECHR:2012:0207JUD004066008, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a095, 96 and 103 and the case-law cited).\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, when the operator of a search engine receives a request for de-referencing which seeks the removal, from the results of an image search carried out on the basis of the name of a person, of photographs displayed in the form of thumbnails representing that person, it must ascertain whether displaying the photographs in question is necessary for exercising the right to freedom of information of internet users who are potentially interested in accessing those photographs by means of such a search, a right protected by Article\u00a011 of the Charter (see, by analogy, judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019,\n GC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n (C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a066).\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the contribution to a debate of public interest is an essential factor to be taken into consideration when striking a balance between competing fundamental rights, for the purposes of assessing whether what prevails are (i) the data subject\u2019s rights to respect for private life and to protection of his or her personal data or (ii) the rights to freedom of expression and information.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as the search engine displays photographs of the data subject outside the context in which they are published on the referenced internet page, most often in order to illustrate the text elements contained in that page, it is necessary to establish whether that context must nevertheless be taken into consideration when striking a balance between the competing rights and interests.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a054 of his Opinion, the question whether that assessment must also include the content of the internet page containing the photograph displayed in the form of a thumbnail, the removal of which is sought, depends on the purpose and nature of the processing at issue.\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the first place, the purpose of the processing at issue, it should be noted that the publication of photographs as a non-verbal means of communication is likely to have a stronger impact on internet users than text publications. Photographs are, as such, an important means of attracting internet users\u2019 attention and may encourage an interest in accessing the articles they illustrate. Since, in particular, photographs are often open to a number of interpretations, displaying them in the list of search results as thumbnails may, in accordance with what has been stated in paragraph\u00a095 of the present judgment, result in a particularly serious interference with the data subject\u2019s right to protection of his or her image, which must be taken into account when weighing-up competing rights and interests.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, a separate weighing-up of competing rights and interests is required depending on whether the case concerns, on the one hand, articles containing photographs which are published on an internet page and which, when placed into their original context, illustrate the information provided in those articles and the opinions expressed in them, or, on the other hand, photographs displayed in the list of results in the form of thumbnails by the operator of a search engine outside the context in which they were published on the original internet page.\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be recalled that not only does the ground justifying the publication of a piece of personal data on a website not necessarily coincide with that which is applicable to the activity of search engines, but also, even where that is the case, the outcome of the weighing-up of the rights and interests at issue may differ according to whether the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine or that carried out by the publisher of that internet page is at issue, given that, first, the legitimate interests justifying the processing may be different and, second, the consequences of the processing for the data subject, and in particular for his or her private life, are not necessarily the same (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a086).\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the second place, the nature of the processing carried out by the operator of the search engine, it must be observed, as did the Advocate General in point\u00a055 of his Opinion, that, by retrieving the photographs of natural persons published on the internet and displaying them separately, in the results of an image search, in the form of thumbnails, the operator of a search engine offers a service in which it carries out autonomous processing of personal data which is distinct both from that of the publisher of the internet page from which the photographs are taken and from that, for which the operator is also responsible, of referencing that page.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, an autonomous assessment of the activity of the operator of the search engine, which consists of displaying results of an image search, in the form of thumbnails, is necessary, given that the additional interference with fundamental rights resulting from such activity may be particularly intense owing to the aggregation, in a search by name, of all information concerning the data subject which is found on the internet. In the context of that autonomous assessment, account must be taken of the fact that the display of the photographs in the form of thumbnails on the internet constitutes, in itself, the result sought by the internet user, regardless of his or her subsequent decision to access the original internet page or not.\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be added that such a specific weighing-up exercise, which takes account of the autonomous nature of the data processing performed by the operator of the search engine, is without prejudice to the possible relevance of text elements which may directly accompany the display of a photograph in the list of search results, since such elements are capable of casting light on the informative value of that photograph for the public and, consequently, of influencing the weighing-up of the rights and interests involved.\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the observations in the order for reference that, while the photographs of the applicants in the main proceedings contribute, in the context of the 4\u00a0June 2015 article of which they form part, to conveying the information and opinions expressed therein, those photographs, outside that context, when they appear solely in the form of thumbnails in the list of results displayed following a search carried out by the search engine, have little informative value. It follows that, if the request for de-referencing of that article were to be rejected, on the ground that freedom of expression and of information must prevail over the rights of the applicants in the main proceedings to respect for their private life and to protection of their personal data, that fact would be without prejudice to the appropriate outcome of the request for removal of those photographs displayed in the form of thumbnails in the list of results.\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, if the request for de-referencing of the 4\u00a0June 2015 article at issue were to be granted, the display, in the form of thumbnails, of the photographs contained in that article would have to be removed. If that display were retained, the practical effect of de-referencing the article would be compromised since internet users would continue to have access to the entire article, by virtue of the link contained in the thumbnails which leads to the internet page on which the article from which the thumbnails are taken is published.\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a012(b) and point (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 as well as Article\u00a017(3)(a) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of the weighing-up exercise which is to be undertaken between the rights referred to in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, on the one hand, and those referred to in Article\u00a011 of the Charter, on the other hand, for the purposes of examining a request for de-referencing made to the operator of a search engine seeking the removal from the results of an image search carried out on the basis of the name of a natural person of photographs displayed in the form of thumbnails representing that person, account must be taken of the informative value of those photographs regardless of the context of their publication on the internet page from which they are taken, but taking into consideration any text element which accompanies directly the display of those photographs in the search results and which is capable of casting light on the informative value of those photographs.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a017(3)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation),\nmust be interpreted as meaning that within the context of the weighing-up exercise which is to be undertaken between the rights referred to in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, on the one hand, and those referred to in Article\u00a011 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on the other hand, for the purposes of examining a request for de-referencing made to the operator of a search engine seeking the removal of a link to content containing claims which the person who submitted the request regards as inaccurate from the list of search results, that de-referencing is not subject to the condition that the question of the accuracy of the referenced content has been resolved, at least provisionally, in an action brought by that person against the content provider. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a012(b) and point (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, as well as Article\u00a017(3)(a) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that in the context of the weighing-up exercise which is to be undertaken between the rights referred to in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on the one hand, and those referred to in Article\u00a011 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on the other hand, for the purposes of examining a request for de-referencing made to the operator of a search engine seeking the removal from the results of an image search carried out on the basis of the name of a natural person of photographs displayed in the form of thumbnails representing that person, account must be taken of the informative value of those photographs regardless of the context of their publication on the internet page from which they are taken, but taking into consideration any text element which accompanies directly the display of those photographs in the search results and which is capable of casting light on the informative value of those photographs."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Therefore it does not alter the existing balance between the individual\u2019s right to privacy and the possibility for Member States to take the measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of this Directive, necessary for the protection of public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the activities relate to State security matters) and the enforcement of criminal law. Consequently, this Directive does not affect the ability of Member States to carry out lawful interception of electronic communications, or take other measures, if necessary for any of these purposes and in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms[, signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950 (\u2018the ECHR\u2019)], as interpreted by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.

Specific reasons were also given as to why the requested telephone tapping was necessary to gather evidence about the criminal activity under investigation and why and under what conditions it was impossible to gather this information by other means.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President of the Spetsializiran nakazatelen sad (Specialised Criminal Court) granted each of those applications on the same day that they were brought and, consequently, issued seven decisions authorising telephone tapping (\u2018the telephone tapping authorisations\u2019).\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Spetsializiran nakazatelen sad (Specialised Criminal Court), the referring court, the telephone tapping authorisations correspond to a pre-drafted template designed to cover all possible cases of authorisation, irrespective of the various circumstances of fact and law, other than the length of time during which the use of special investigative methods was authorised.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, those authorisations merely state that the statutory provisions to which they refer have been complied with, without identifying the authority which made the telephone tapping applications and without indicating the name and telephone number of each person concerned, the offence or offences referred to in Article\u00a0172(2) of the NPK and Article\u00a03(1) of the ZSRS, the evidence leading to the suspicion of the commission of one or more of those offences or even the categories of persons and premises, referred to in Article\u00a012 of the ZSRS, for which the use of special investigative methods has been authorised. Furthermore, the referring court states that those authorisations do not set out the arguments of the Specialised Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office demonstrating, on the basis of Article\u00a0172 of the NPK and Article\u00a014 of the ZSRS, that it is impossible to gather the information sought by any means other than telephone tapping, nor do they specify, with regard to Article\u00a0175 of the NPK, whether the period specified for the use of those methods is set for the first time or whether it is an extension of the time limit and on the basis of what assumptions and arguments that time limit has been decided.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On foot of those authorisations, some of the conversations conducted by IP, DD, ZI and SS were recorded and stored in accordance with Article\u00a011 of the ZSRS.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 19\u00a0June 2020, the Specialised Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office accused those four persons, together with a fifth, HYA, of participating in an organised criminal gang for the purpose of enrichment, smuggling third-country nationals across Bulgarian borders, assisting them to enter Bulgarian territory illegally and receiving or giving bribes in connection with those activities. The accused include three agents of the Sofia airport border police.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court, hearing the merits of the case, states that the content of the recorded conversations is of direct relevance in determining whether the charges brought against IP, DD, ZI and SS are well founded.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It explains that it is required, in advance, to review the validity of the procedure which led to the telephone tapping authorisations. In that context, it might be considered that the fact that those authorisations were drawn up in accordance with a pre-drafted template text that does not contain individualised reasons does not enable it to ascertain the reasons specifically relied on by the judge who granted those authorisations. Conversely, it would also be possible to take the view that, by acceding to the request of the Specialised Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the judge who granted the telephone tapping authorisations accepted the reasons for those applications in full and endorsed them.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While not doubting that the national legislation on telephone tapping, as it results in particular from the provisions of the NPK and the ZSRS, is compatible with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, the referring court is uncertain whether a national practice such as that at issue in the main proceedings, according to which the obligation to state the reasons for the judicial decision authorising the use of special investigative methods following a reasoned request by the criminal authorities is satisfied where that decision, drawn up in accordance with a pre-drafted template which does not contain individualised reasons, merely states that the requirements laid down by that legislation, to which it refers, have been complied with, is compatible with the last sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of that directive, read in the light of recital\u00a011 thereof.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, that court points out that judicial decisions such as telephone tapping authorisations limit, with regard to the natural persons concerned, the rights and freedoms guaranteed in Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019). It also has doubts as to whether such a practice complies with the right to effective judicial protection, enshrined in Article\u00a047 of the Charter, and the principle of proportionality as a general principle of EU law.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the answer is in the negative, the referring court asks whether EU law precludes an interpretation of national legislation such that recordings of telephone conversations authorised by a judicial decision which does not contain a statement of reasons may nevertheless be used as evidence in criminal proceedings.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Spetsializiran nakazatelen sad (Specialised Criminal Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is a practice of national courts in criminal proceedings whereby the court authorises the interception, recording and storage of telephone conversations of suspects by means of a pre-drafted, generic text template in which it is merely asserted, without any individualisation, that the statutory provisions have been complied with compatible with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58\u00a0\u2026 read in conjunction with Article\u00a05(1) and recital\u00a011 thereof?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If not, is it contrary to EU law if the national law is interpreted as meaning that information obtained as a result of such authorisation is used to prove the charges brought?\u2019\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 5\u00a0August 2022, the Sofiyski gradski sad (Sofia City Court) informed the Court that, following a legislative amendment which entered into force on 27\u00a0July 2022, the Spetsializiran nakazatelen sad (Specialised Criminal Court) had been dissolved and that certain criminal cases brought before that court, including the case in the main proceedings, had been transferred to it as from that date.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be recalled that, when Member States implement, on the basis of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, legislative measures derogating from the principle of confidentiality of electronic communications enshrined in Article\u00a05(1) of that directive, the protection of data subjects falls within the scope of that directive only in so far as the measures at issue impose processing obligations on providers of such communications services, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of Regulation 2016/679, made applicable by Article\u00a02 of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a094(2) of that regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a096 and 104 and the case-law cited).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the latter provisions, the concept of processing includes, inter alia, for such providers, granting access to communications and data or transmitting them to the competent authorities (see, to that effect and by analogy, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nPrivacy International\n, C-623/17, EU:C:2020:790, paragraphs\u00a039 to 41 and the case-law cited).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is for the referring court to ascertain whether the special investigative methods used in the main proceedings and, in particular, the interception referred to in Article\u00a06 of the ZSRS, had the effect of imposing such processing obligations on the providers concerned and whether, therefore, the main proceedings fall within the scope of Directive 2002/58. It must therefore be clarified that the Court will answer the first question only in so far as the case in the main proceedings falls within the scope of that directive, in particular Article\u00a015(1) thereof.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of those preliminary clarifications, it must be held that, by its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding a national practice under which judicial decisions authorising the use of special investigative methods, following a reasoned request by the criminal authorities, are drawn up in accordance with a pre-drafted text and without individualised reasons, merely stating, apart from the validity period of those authorisations, that the requirements laid down by that legislation, to which those decisions refer, have been complied with.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a05(1) of that directive enshrines the principle of the confidentiality of communications and the related traffic data by means of a public communications network and publicly available electronic communications services. That principle is reflected in the prohibition on listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communications and the related traffic data without the consent of the users concerned, except in the situations provided for in Article\u00a015(1) of that directive.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The latter article thus provides that Member States may adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope of the rights and obligations provided for in Article\u00a05 of that directive, in particular when such a restriction constitutes a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society, to ensure the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences. It also states that all those legislative measures must be in accordance with the general principles of EU law, including the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the legislative measures governing access by the competent authorities to the data referred to in Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2002/58 cannot be confined to requiring that such access serve the purpose pursued by the legislative measures themselves, but must also lay down the substantive and procedural conditions governing that processing (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur \n(Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraph\u00a049 and the case-law cited).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such measures and conditions must be in accordance with the general principles of EU law, including the principle of proportionality, and with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter, as follows from Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, which refers to Article\u00a06(1) and (2) TEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0113 and the case-law cited).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the procedural conditions referred to in paragraph\u00a042 above must be in accordance with the right to a fair trial, enshrined in the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, which corresponds, as is apparent from the explanations relating to that article, to Article\u00a06(1) ECHR. That right requires that all judgments must state the reasons on which they are based (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0September 2012, \nTrade Agency\n, C-619/10, EU:C:2012:531, paragraphs\u00a052 and 53 and the case-law cited).\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, where a legislative measure adopted under Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 provides that restrictions to the principle of confidentiality of electronic communications laid down in Article\u00a05(1) of that directive may be adopted by means of judicial decisions, Article\u00a015(1), read in conjunction with the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, requires Member States to provide that such decisions must state the reasons on which they are based.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, as the Advocate General noted in point\u00a038 of his Opinion, the right to an effective judicial review, guaranteed by Article\u00a047 of the Charter, requires that the person concerned must be able to ascertain the reasons for a decision taken in relation to him or her, either by reading that decision or by being informed of those reasons, so as to enable him or her to defend his or her rights in the best possible conditions and to decide in full knowledge of the facts whether or not to refer the matter to the court with jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of that decision (see, by analogy, judgment of 24\u00a0November 2020, \nMinister van Buitenlandse Zaken\n, C-225/19 and C-226/19, EU:C:2020:951, paragraph\u00a043 and the case-law cited).\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the explanations provided by the referring court that, pursuant to national legislative measures adopted pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, in particular Article\u00a034 and Article\u00a0174(4) of the NPK and Article\u00a015(1) of the ZSRS, read in conjunction with Article\u00a0121(4) of the Constitution, reasons must be given for any judicial decision authorising the use of special investigative methods.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being the case, the first question is raised not in the light of the legislative provisions of the NPK and the ZSRS adopted under Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, but of a national judicial practice implementing those legislative provisions, under which decisions to authorise the use of special investigative methods are reasoned by means of a pre-drafted template text intended to cover all possible cases of authorisation, and that does not contain individualised reasons. Such decisions are adopted in a specific procedural context.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that, under Bulgarian law, the decision authorising the use of special investigative methods is adopted following a procedure designed to make it possible, with regard to a person in respect of whom there are reasonable grounds to believe that person is preparing, committing or have committed a serious intentional criminal offence, to secure the effective and rapid collection of data which could not be collected by means other than the special investigative methods requested or which could only be collected with extreme difficulty.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the context of that procedure, the authorities empowered to request the use of such methods, within the meaning of Article\u00a0173(1) and (2) of the NPK and Article\u00a013(1) of the ZSRS, must, in accordance with Article\u00a0173(2) of the NPK and Article\u00a014(1)(7) of the ZSRS, submit in writing to the court having jurisdiction a reasoned and detailed application setting out the offence which is the subject of the investigation, the measures taken in the context of that investigation and the results thereof, data identifying the person or premises targeted by the application, the operating methods to be applied, the expected duration of the surveillance and the reasons why this duration is requested, as well as the reasons why the use of those methods is essential to the investigation.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the legal rules governing that procedure that the court which grants authorisation to use special investigative methods takes its decision on the basis of a reasoned and detailed application, the content of which, provided for by law, must enable it to ascertain whether the conditions for the grant of such authorisation have been met.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, that practice forms part of legislative measures, adopted under Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, which provide for the possibility of taking reasoned judicial decisions which have the effect of restricting the principle of confidentiality of electronic communications and traffic data, laid down in Article\u00a05(1) of that directive. In that regard, it is deemed to implement the obligation to state reasons laid down by those legislative measures in accordance with the requirements of the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter referred to in the last sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of that directive with the reference to Article\u00a06(1) and (2) TEU.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, since, in the context of that procedure, the court having jurisdiction examined the grounds of a detailed application such as that referred to in paragraph\u00a050 of the present judgment, and it considers, at the end of its examination, that that application is justified, it must be held that, by signing a pre-drafted text in accordance with a template indicating that the legal requirements have been complied with, that court endorsed the grounds of the application while ensuring compliance with the legal requirements.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the European Commission states in its written observations, it would be artificial to require that the authorisation to use special investigative methods should contain a specific and detailed statement of reasons, whereas the application in respect of which that authorisation is granted already contains such a statement of reasons under national law.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, once the person concerned has been informed that special investigative methods have been applied to him or her, the obligation to state reasons referred to in the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter requires that that person be, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraph\u00a046 of the present judgment, in a position to understand the reasons why the use of those methods has been authorised, in order to be able, where appropriate, to challenge that authorisation appropriately and effectively. That requirement also applies to any court, such as, inter alia, the trial court, which, in accordance with its powers, must examine, of its own motion or at the request of the person concerned, the lawfulness of that authorisation.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It will therefore be for the referring court to determine whether, in the context of the practice referred to in paragraph\u00a039 above, compliance with that provision of the Charter and Directive 2002/58 is guaranteed. To that end, it will have to determine whether the person to whom special investigative methods have been applied and the court responsible for reviewing the legality of the authorisation to use those methods are both in a position to understand the reasons for that authorisation.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While that verification is solely a matter for the referring court, the Court, when giving a preliminary ruling on a reference, may, in appropriate cases, nonetheless give clarifications to guide the national court in its decision (judgment of 5\u00a0May 2022, \nVictorinox\n, C-179/21, EU:C:2022:353, paragraph\u00a049 and the case-law cited).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, since authorisation to use special investigative methods is granted on the basis of a reasoned and detailed application from the competent national authorities, it must be verified that the persons referred to in paragraph\u00a056 of the present judgment can have access not only to the authorisation decision but also to the application of the authority which requested that authorisation.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in order to comply with the obligation to state reasons under the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, it is important, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point\u00a041 of his Opinion, that those same persons should be able to understand easily and unambiguously, by means of a cross-reading of the authorisation to use special investigative methods and of the accompanying reasoned application, the precise reasons why that authorisation was granted in the light of the factual and legal circumstances characterising the individual case underlying the application, just as it is imperative that such a cross-reading should reveal the validity period of the authorisation.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where, as in the present case, the authorisation decision merely indicates the validity period of the authorisation and states that the legal provisions to which they refer have been complied with, it is essential that the application should clearly state all the necessary information so that both the person concerned and the court responsible for verifying the legality of the authorisation granted are able to understand that, on the basis of this information alone, the judge who granted the authorisation has, by endorsing the reasoning set out in the application, come to the conclusion that all legal requirements have been met.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If a cross-reading of the application and subsequent authorisation does not make it possible to understand, easily and unequivocally, the reasons for that authorisation, it must be held that the obligation to state reasons which follows from\u00a0Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, has not been complied with.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be added that, in accordance with Article\u00a052(3) of the Charter, the rights contained in the Charter have the same meaning and scope as the corresponding rights guaranteed by the ECHR, which does not preclude EU law from affording more extensive protection.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is apparent from the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights that the statement of reasons, albeit succinct, constitutes an essential safeguard against abuse of surveillance in that only such a statement makes it possible to ensure that the judge has correctly examined the application for authorisation and the evidence provided and has genuinely verified whether the surveillance requested constitutes a justified and proportionate interference in the exercise of the right to respect for private and family life guaranteed in Article\u00a08 ECHR. The European Court of Human Rights has nevertheless recognised, with regard to two judgments of the Spetsializiran nakazatelen sad (Specialised Criminal Court), that the lack of individualised reasoning cannot automatically lead to the conclusion that the judge who issued the authorisation did not properly review the application (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 11\u00a0January 2022, \nEkimdzhiev and Others v. Bulgaria\n (CE:ECHR:2022:0111JUD007007812, \u00a7\u00a7 313 and 314 and the case-law cited).\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that the judgment of the ECtHR of 15\u00a0January 2015, \nDragojevi\u0107 v. Croatia\n (CE:ECHR:2015:0115JUD006895511), referred to by the referring court, cannot call into question the considerations set out in paragraphs\u00a058 to 61 of the present judgment. Indeed, in reaching the conclusion that Article\u00a08 ECHR had been infringed, the European Court of Human Rights did not, in that judgment of 15\u00a0January 2015, examine the question whether the person concerned could, by a cross-reading of the authorising decisions and the application for surveillance, understand the reasons relied on by the investigating judge, but rather the separate question of whether the lack or inadequacy of the statement of reasons given for the authorising decisions could be remedied a posteriori.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing grounds, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude a national practice under which judicial decisions authorising the use of special investigative methods following a reasoned and detailed application from the criminal authorities, are drawn up by means of a pre-drafted text which does not contain individualised reasons, but which merely states, in addition to the validity period of the authorisation, that the requirements laid down by the legislation to which those decisions refer have been complied with, provided that the precise reasons why the court with jurisdiction considered that the legal requirements had been complied with, in the light of the factual and legal circumstances characterising the case in question, can be easily and unambiguously inferred from a cross-reading of the decision and the application for authorisation, the latter of which must be made accessible, after the authorisation has been given, to the person against whom the use of special investigative methods has been authorised.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the answer given to the first question, the second question does not require an answer.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) read in the light of the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nis to be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude a national practice under which judicial decisions authorising the use of special investigative methods following a reasoned and detailed application from the criminal authorities, are drawn up by means of a pre-drafted text which does not contain individualised reasons, but which merely states, in addition to the validity period of the authorisation, that the requirements laid down by the legislation to which those decisions refer have been complied with, provided that the precise reasons why the court with jurisdiction considered that the legal requirements had been complied with, in the light of the factual and legal circumstances characterising the case in question, can be easily and unambiguously inferred from a cross-reading of the decision and the application for authorisation, the latter of which must be made accessible, after the authorisation has been given, to the person against whom the use of special investigative methods has been authorised."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the workers recorded their working hours by inserting a magnetic card into a time clock installed in the premises of a store located beside the inspected premises; \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0not only was the record of working time not accessible to any worker of the undertaking or of the establishment where they carried out their duties, but it could also be consulted only by the person who had computerised access to it, namely the regional manager of Worten, who was not present at the time of the inspection; in such a case, only Worten\u2019s central human resources department could provide the data in that register.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 15\u00a0March 2010, in response to a notice to present documents, the record of working time, setting out the legally required data, was submitted to ACT.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 14\u00a0March 2012, ACT found that Warton had committed a serious administrative offence by infringing the rules concerning the record of working time set out in Article\u00a0202(1) of the Employment Code, since Warton had not permitted ACT to carry out an immediate consultation, in the establishment concerned, of the record of the working time of the workers employed in that establishment. The serious nature of the offence was stated to arise from the fact that the record of working time allows quick and direct verification of whether the organisation of an undertaking\u2019s activities complies with the regulations concerning working hours. Consequently, ACT imposed a fine of EUR\u00a02\u00a0000 on Worten.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Worten brought an action for annulment against that decision before the Tribunal do trabalho de Viseu.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Tribunal do trabalho de Viseu decided to stay the proceedings and refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a02 of Directive 95/46 \u2026 to be interpreted as meaning that the record of working time, that is, the indication, in relation to each worker, of the times when working hours begin and end, as well as the corresponding breaks and intervals, is included within the concept of \u201cpersonal data\u201d?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If so, is the Portuguese State obliged, under Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46 \u2026 to provide for appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, if Question 2 is answered in the affirmative, when the Member State does not adopt any measure pursuant to Article\u00a017(1) of Directive\u00a095/46 \u2026 and when an employer, as a controller of such data, adopts a system of restricted access to those data which does not allow automatic access by the national authority responsible for monitoring working conditions, is the principle of the primacy of European law to be interpreted as meaning that the Member State cannot penalise that employer for such behaviour?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question the referring court asks whether Article\u00a02(a) of Directive\u00a095/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that a record of working time, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, containing the indication, in relation to each worker, of the times when working hours begin and end, as well as the corresponding breaks and intervals, constitutes \u2018personal data\u2019, within the meaning of that provision.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, it suffices to note that, as maintained by all of the interested parties who submitted written observations, the data contained in a record of working time such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which concern, in relation to each worker, the daily work periods and rest periods, constitute personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46, because they represent \u2018information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019 (see, to that effect, inter alia, Joined Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n [2003] ECR I-4989, paragraph 64; Case C-524/06 \nHuber\n [2008] ECR I-9705, paragraph 43; and Case C-553/07 \nRijkeboer \n[2009] ECR\u00a0I-3889, paragraph 42).\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The collection, recording, organisation, storage, consultation, and use of such data by an employer, as well as their transmission by that employer to the national authorities responsible for monitoring working conditions, thus represent the \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) of Directive\u00a095/46 (see, to that effect, inter alia, \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, paragraph\u00a064, and \nHuber\n, paragraph 43). \n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, since it is undisputed, in the main proceedings, that the processing of personal data is carried out by automatic means and that none of the exceptions set out in Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 applies, that processing falls within the scope of Directive 95/46.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that a record of working time, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, containing the indication, in relation to each worker, of the times when working hours begin and end, as well as the corresponding breaks and intervals, constitutes \u2018personal data\u2019, within the meaning of that provision.\n\u00a0\nThe second and third questions\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second and third questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that each Member State is obliged to provide for appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, and, if so, whether a Member State which has not adopted such measures may penalise an employer which, as a controller of personal data, has adopted a system of restricted access to those data which does not allow automatic access by the national authority responsible for monitoring working conditions.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be recalled that, in accordance with Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46 concerning security of processing, Member States are to provide that the controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures which, having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation, are to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected (see, to that effect, \nRijkeboer\n, paragraph 62).\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, contrary to the premiss on which the second and third questions are based, Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46 does not require Member States, except where they act as controllers, to adopt those technical and organisational measures, as the obligation to adopt such measures concerns solely the controller; namely, in the present case, the employer. Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46 does, however, require the Member States to adopt a provision in their national law providing for that obligation.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it is not in any way apparent from the order for reference that the data at issue in the main proceedings were the subject of accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, or any other unlawful form of processing, within the meaning of Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46. On the contrary, it follows from the information in the file before the Court that it is undisputed, in the main proceedings, that access to those data by the national authority responsible for monitoring working conditions is authorised by national law.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in its written observations, Worten claims that the obligation to make available the record of working time so as to allow its immediate consultation, set out in Article\u00a0202(1) of the Employment Code, is, in practice, incompatible with the obligation to establish an adequate system of protection of the personal data contained in that record. Such an obligation amounts to allowing any employee of the undertaking concerned to gain access to the personal data contained in that record, in breach of the obligation, set out in Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46, to ensure the security of such data. In Worten\u2019s view, such generalised access therefore renders that provision entirely ineffective.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That line of argument cannot succeed. Contrary to the premiss on which it is based, the obligation for an employer, as a controller of personal data, to provide the national authority responsible for monitoring working conditions immediate access to the record of working time in no way implies that the personal data contained in that record must necessarily, on that ground alone, be made accessible to persons not authorised for that purpose. As the Portuguese government rightly pointed out, all controllers of personal data must, under Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that only those persons duly authorised to access the personal data in question are entitled to respond to a request for access from a third party.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it does not appear that Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46 is relevant for the purposes of resolving the dispute in the main proceedings.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in the procedure laid down by Article\u00a0267\u00a0TFEU providing for cooperation between national courts and the Court of Justice, it is for the latter to provide the national court with an answer which will be of use to it and enable it to determine the case before it. To that end, the Court may have to reformulate the questions referred to it. The Court has a duty to interpret all provisions of European Union law which national courts require in order to decide the actions pending before them, even if those provisions are not expressly indicated in the questions referred to the Court of Justice by those courts (see, to that effect, inter alia, Case C-45/06 \nCampina \n[2007] ECR I-2089, paragraphs 30 and 31, and Case C-243/09 \nFu\u00df\n [2010] ECR\u00a0I-9849, paragraph 39).\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, even if, formally, the referring court has limited its questions to the interpretation of Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46, that does not prevent this Court from providing the referring court with all the elements of interpretation of European Union law that may be of assistance in adjudicating in the case pending before it, whether or not the referring court has referred to them in the wording of its questions. It is, in this regard, for the Court to extract from all the information provided by the national court, in particular from the grounds of the decision to make the reference, the points of European Union law which require interpretation in view of the subject-matter of the dispute (see \nFu\u00df\n, paragraph 40).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is clear from the documents before the Court that the referring court seeks, in essence, to determine whether the provisions of Directive\u00a095/46 are to be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which requires an employer to make the record of working time available to the national authority responsible for monitoring working conditions so as to allow its immediate consultation. As noted in paragraph\u00a015 of the present judgment, the breach of that obligation laid down in Article\u00a0202(1) of the Employment Code was the reason for the fine imposed on Worten.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be recalled that, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of Directive 95/46, entitled \u2018General rules on the lawfulness of the processing of personal data\u2019, all processing of personal data must, subject to the exceptions permitted under Article\u00a013, comply, first, with the principles relating to data quality set out in Article\u00a06 of Directive 95/46 and, secondly, with one of the six principles for making data processing legitimate listed in Article\u00a07 of that directive (\n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, paragraph 65; \nHuber\n, paragraph 48; and Joined Cases C-468/10 and C-469/10 \nANSEF and FECEMD\n [2011] ECR I-12181, paragraph 26). \n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, under Article\u00a06(1)(b) and (c) of Directive 95/46, the data must be \u2018collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes\u2019 and must be \u2018adequate, relevant and not excessive\u2019 in relation to those purposes. In addition, under Article\u00a07(c) and (e) of the directive, the processing of personal data is permissible only if it \u2018is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject\u2019 or \u2018is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party to whom the data are disclosed\u2019 (\n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, paragraph 66).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That seems to be the case in a situation such as that in the main proceedings, since it appears that \u2013 which is for the referring court to verify \u2013 on the one hand, the personal data contained in the record of working time are collected in order to ensure compliance with the legislation relating to working conditions and, on the other hand, the processing of those personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the employer is subject and to the performance of the monitoring task entrusted to the national authority responsible for monitoring working conditions.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the actual rules for the organisation of the national authority\u2019s access to those personal data in order to carry out its task of monitoring working conditions, it must be recalled that only the grant of access to authorities having powers in that field could be considered to be necessary within the meaning of Article\u00a07(e) of Directive 95/46 (see, to that effect, \nHuber\n, paragraph 61).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concerning the employer\u2019s obligation to provide that national authority immediate access to the record of working time, it is clear from the case-law that such an obligation could be necessary, within the meaning of Article\u00a07(e) of Directive\u00a095/46, if it contributes to the more effective application of the legislation relating to working conditions (see, by analogy, \nHuber\n, paragraph 62).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, it must be pointed out that the purpose of Directive 2003/88 is to lay down minimum requirements intended to improve the living and working conditions of workers through approximation of national rules concerning, in particular, the duration of working time, by ensuring that they are entitled to minimum rest periods \u2013 particularly daily and weekly \u2013 and adequate breaks and by providing for a ceiling on the average duration of the working week (see, to that effect, inter alia, Joined Cases C-397/01 to C-403/01 \nPfeiffer and Others\n [2004] ECR I-8835, paragraph 76, and Case C-429/09 \nFu\u00df\n [2010] ECR I-12167, paragraph 43).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the above, Article\u00a06(b) of Directive 2003/88 requires the Member States to take the \u2018measures necessary\u2019 to ensure that, in keeping with the need to protect the safety and health of workers, the average working time for each seven-day period, including overtime, does not exceed 48 hours (see, to that effect, \nPfeiffer and Others\n, paragraph 100, and Case C-243/09 \nFu\u00df\n, paragraph 33).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the first subparagraph of Article\u00a022(1) of Directive 2003/88 provides that a Member State may choose not to apply Article\u00a06 of that directive, provided, inter alia, it takes the necessary measures to ensure that the employer keeps up-to-date records of all workers who carry out such work (point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a022(1) of that directive) and that the records are placed at the disposal of the competent authorities, which may, for reasons connected with the safety and/or health of workers, prohibit or restrict the possibility of exceeding the maximum weekly working hours (point (d) of subparagraph 1 of Article\u00a022(1) of that directive).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the European Commission, although Directive 2003/88 does not expressly require the Member States to adopt legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the monitoring of compliance with the obligations imposed by that directive may entail \u2013 as \u2018measures necessary\u2019 to the performance of the objectives which that directive pursues \u2013 the establishment of surveillance measures. In the Commission\u2019s view, the employer\u2019s obligation to allow immediate consultation of the record of working time ensures that data is not altered during the interval between the inspection visit carried out by the competent national authorities and the actual verification of those data by those authorities.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Worten claims, by contrast, that this obligation is excessive, given the interference it entails in workers\u2019 private lives. First, the record of working time is intended to provide workers with a means of proving the hours they have actually worked. The authenticity of that record has not been contested in the main proceedings. Secondly, that record allows the assessment of average working times, for the purposes of monitoring, inter alia, working hours exemptions. For that purpose, the immediate availability of those records does not, according to Worten, provide any added value. Moreover, the information in that record could be submitted subsequently.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is for the referring court to examine whether the employer\u2019s obligation to provide the competent national authority access to the record of working time so as to allow its immediate consultation can be considered necessary for the purposes of the performance by that authority of its monitoring task, by contributing to the more effective application of the legislation relating to working conditions, in particular as regard working time.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, it must also be noted that, in any case, if such an obligation is considered necessary to achieving that objective, the penalties imposed with a view to ensuring the effective application of the requirements laid down by Directive 2003/88 must also respect the principle of proportionality, which it is also for the referring court to verify in the main proceedings (see, by analogy, Case C-101/01 \nLindqvist\n [2003] ECR\u00a0I-12971, paragraph 88).\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the answer to the second and third questions is that Article\u00a06(1)(b) and (c) and Article\u00a07(c) and (e) of Directive 95/46 do not preclude national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which requires an employer to make a record of working time available to the national authority responsible for monitoring working conditions so as to allow its immediate consultation, provided that this obligation is necessary for the purposes of the performance by that authority of its task of monitoring the application of the legislation relating to working conditions, in particular as regards working time.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data is to be interpreted as meaning that a record of working time, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which indicates, in relation to each worker, the times when working hours begin and end, as well as the corresponding breaks and intervals, is included within the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019, within the meaning of that provision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a06(1)(b) and (c) and Article\u00a07(c) and (e) of Directive 95/46 do not preclude national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which requires an employer to make the record of working time available to the national authority responsible for monitoring working conditions so as to allow its immediate consultation, provided that this obligation is necessary for the purposes of the performance by that authority of its task of monitoring the application of the legislation relating to working conditions, in particular as regards working time."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 4 May 2017, C-13/16 (\nR\u012bgas satiksme\n)\nGeneral data protection

judicial decisions or judicial case files, may be processed only by persons provided for by law and in the cases provided for by law.\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Article\u00a0261 of the Latvijas Administrat\u012bvo p\u0101rk\u0101pumu kodekss (Latvian Administrative Infringements Code), a person who has suffered harm caused by an infringement may be given the status of victim in the context of administrative proceedings leading to sanctions, by the body or official who is authorised to examine the case. That provision provides for the rights of victims, including the right to consult the case file and to use his procedural rights to obtain compensation.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In December 2012 a road accident occurred in Riga. A taxi driver had stopped his vehicle at the side of the road. As a trolleybus of R\u012bgas satiksme was passing alongside the taxi, a passenger sitting in the back seat of that taxi opened the door, which scraped against and damaged the trolleybus. Administrative proceedings leading to sanctions were initiated and a report was drawn up finding an administrative offence.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the taxi driver was initially held responsible for that accident, R\u012bgas satiksme sought compensation from the insurance company covering the civil liability of the owner and lawful user of the taxi. However, that insurance company informed R\u012bgas satiksme that it would not pay R\u012bgas satiksme any compensation on the basis that the accident had occurred due to the conduct of the passenger in that taxi, rather than the driver. It stated that R\u012bgas satiksme could bring civil proceedings against that passenger.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0R\u012bgas satiksme then applied to the national police asking it to provide information concerning the person on whom an administrative penalty had been imposed following the accident, to provide copies of the statements given by the taxi driver and the passenger on the circumstances of the accident, and to indicate the first name and surname, identity document number, and address of the taxi passenger. R\u012bgas satiksme indicated to the national police that the information requested would be used only for the purpose of bringing civil proceedings.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national police responded by granting R\u012bgas satiksme\u2019s request in part, namely by providing the first name and surname of the taxi passenger but refusing to provide the identity document number and address of that person. Nor did it send R\u012bgas satiksme the statements given by the persons involved in the accident.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision of the national police was based on the fact that documents in the case file in administrative proceedings leading to sanctions may be provided only to the parties to those proceedings. R\u012bgas satiksme is not a party to the case at issue. Under the Latvian Administrative Infringements Code, a person may at his express request be given the status of victim in administrative proceedings leading to sanctions by the body or official responsible for examining the case. In the present case R\u012bgas satiksme did not exercise that right.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0R\u012bgas satiksme brought an administrative law action before the administrat\u012bv\u0101 rajona tiesa (District Administrative Court, Latvia) against the decision of the national police in so far as it refused to reveal the identity document number and address of the passenger involved in the accident. By judgment of 16\u00a0May 2014, that court upheld the action brought by R\u012bgas satiksme and ordered the national police to provide the information relating to the identity document number and place of residence of that passenger.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national police brought an appeal in cassation before the referring court. That court sought an opinion from the Datu valsts inspekcija (National Data Protection Agency, Latvia) the Data Protection Agency which stated, in its response of 13\u00a0October 2015, that Article\u00a07(6) of the Law on the Protection of Personal Data could not be used as a legal basis to provide personal data in the case in the main proceedings as the Latvian Administrative Infringements Code sets out the persons to which the national police may disclose the information relating to a case. Consequently, according to the National Data Protection Agency, the disclosure of personal data relating to administrative proceedings leading to sanctions may be carried out only in accordance with paragraphs\u00a03 and 5 of that article in the situations laid down by the law. Article\u00a07 of the law does not oblige the data controller, in this case, the national police, to process the data, but simply permits it.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The National Data Protection Agency also indicated that R\u012bgas satiksme had two other means of obtaining that information. It could either submit a reasoned request to the Civil Registry or apply to the courts pursuant to Articles\u00a098 to 100 of the Latvian Law on Civil Procedure for the production of evidence, in order for the court in question to request from the national police the personal data so that R\u012bgas satiksme would be able to bring proceedings against the person concerned.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court has doubts regarding the effectiveness of the means of obtaining the personal data referred to by the National Data Protection Agency. It states, in that regard, first, that if an application made to the Civil Registry mentions only the name of the taxi passenger, it may be that that passenger cannot be identified by his identity document number as the same surname and first name may be shared by several people. Second, the referring court takes the view that, in the light of the national law on the provision on evidence, in order to bring a civil action, the applicant would have to know at least the place of residence of the defendant.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring court is of the opinion that there are doubts as to the interpretation of the concept of \u2018necessity\u2019 referred to in Article\u00a07(f) of that directive.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Augst\u0101k\u0101s tiesas Administrat\u012bvo lietu departaments (Supreme Court, Administrative Division, Latvia) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the phrase \u2018is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the \u2026 third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed\u2019, in Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46/EC, be interpreted as meaning that the national police must disclose to R\u012bgas satiksme the personal data sought [by the latter] which are necessary in order for civil proceedings to be initiated?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the fact that, as the documents in the case file indicate, the taxi passenger whose data is sought by R\u012bgas satiksme was a minor at the time of the accident relevant to the answer to that question?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks whether Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as imposing the obligation to disclose personal data to a third party in order to enable him to bring an action for damages before a civil court for harm caused by the person concerned by the protection of that data, and if the fact that that person is a minor has a bearing on the interpretation of that provision.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case in the main proceedings, it is common ground that the identity document number and the address of the taxi passenger, of which R\u012bgas satiksme requests communication, constitute information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person and, therefore, \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46. It is also common ground that the national police, to which that request was addressed, is responsible for processing that data and, in particular, for their possible communication within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of that directive.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a05 of Directive 95/46, it is for the Member States to specify, within the limits of the provisions of that directive, the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful. Article\u00a07 of that directive, which lays down the principles relating to the legitimacy of such processing, provides in that regard that \u2018Member States shall provide that [it] may be processed only if\u2019 one of the situations listed exhaustively by that provision exists. Under Article\u00a07(f), such processing may be carried out where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection under Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 95/46.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is accordingly clear from the scheme of Directive 95/46 and from the wording of Article\u00a07 thereof that Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 does not, in itself, set out an obligation, but expresses the possibility of processing data such as the communication to a third party of data necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by that third party. As the Advocate General stated in points\u00a043 to 46 of his Opinion, such an interpretation may also be deduced from other EU instruments touching upon personal data (see, to that effect, as regards the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008, \nPromusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraphs\u00a054 and 55).\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it should be pointed out that Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 does not preclude such communication, in the event that it is made on the basis of national law, in accordance with the conditions laid down in that provision.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 lays down three cumulative conditions so that the processing of personal data is lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed; second, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and third, that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the condition relating to the pursuit of a legitimate interest, as the Advocate General stated in points\u00a065, 79 and 80 of his Opinion, there is no doubt that the interest of a third party in obtaining the personal information of a person who damaged their property in order to sue that person for damages can be qualified as a legitimate interest (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008, \nPromusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraph\u00a053). That analysis is supported by Article\u00a08(2)(e) of Directive 95/46, which provides that the prohibition on the processing of certain types of personal data, such as those revealing racial origin or political opinions, is not to apply, in particular, where the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the condition relating to the necessity of processing personal data, it should be borne in mind that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (judgments of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraph\u00a086; of 7\u00a0November 2013, \nIPI\n, C-473/12, EU:C:2013:715, paragraph\u00a039; and of 11\u00a0December 2014, \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraph\u00a028). In that regard, according to the information provided by the national court, communication of merely the first name and surname of the person who caused the damage does not make it possible to identify that person with sufficient precision in order to be able to bring an action against him. Accordingly, for that purpose, it is necessary to obtain also the address and/or the identification number of that person.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, as regards the condition of balancing the opposing rights and interests at issue, it depends in principle on the specific circumstances of the particular case (see, to that effect, judgments of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nAsociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Establecimientos Financieros de Cr\u00e9dito\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraph\u00a040, and of 19\u00a0October 2016, \nBreyer\n, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph\u00a062).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court has held that it is possible to take into consideration the fact that the seriousness of the infringement of the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights resulting from that processing can vary depending on the possibility of accessing the data at issue in public sources (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nAsociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Establecimientos Financieros de Cr\u00e9dito\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraph\u00a044).\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the second part of the question referred for a preliminary ruling as set out in paragraph\u00a023 of the present judgment, it should be noted that the age of the data subject may be one of the factors which should be taken into account in the context of that balancing of interests. However, as the Advocate General pointed out in points\u00a082 to 84 of his Opinion and subject to the determination to be carried out in that respect by the national court, it does not appear to be justified, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, to refuse to disclose to an injured party the personal data necessary for bringing an action for damages against the person who caused the harm, or, where appropriate, the persons exercising parental authority, on the ground that the person who caused the damage was a minor.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing considerations that Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as not imposing the obligation to disclose personal data to a third party in order to enable him to bring an action for damages before a civil court for harm caused by the person concerned by the protection of that data. However, Article\u00a07(f) of that directive does not preclude such disclosure on the basis of national law.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as not imposing the obligation to disclose personal data to a third party in order to enable him to bring an action for damages before a civil court for harm caused by the person concerned by the protection of that data. However, Article\u00a07(f) of that directive does not preclude such disclosure on the basis of national law."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 8 Apr 2014, C-293/12 (\nDigital Rights Ireland and Seitlinger and

That assessment served as the basis for the drawing up of the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the retention of data processed in connection with the provision of public electronic communication services and amending Directive 2002/58/EC (COM(2005) 438 final, \u2018the proposal for a directive\u2019), also presented on 21\u00a0September 2005, which led to the adoption of Directive 2006/24 on the basis of Article\u00a095 EC.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recital\u00a04 in the preamble to Directive 2006/24 states:\n\u2018Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC sets out the conditions under which Member States may restrict the scope of the rights and obligations provided for in Article\u00a05, Article\u00a06, Article\u00a08(1), (2), (3) and (4), and Article\u00a09 of that Directive. Any such restrictions must be necessary, appropriate and proportionate within a democratic society for specific public order purposes, i.e. to safeguard national security (i.e. State security), defence, public security or the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of unauthorised use of the electronic communications systems.\u2019\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the first sentence of recital\u00a05 in the preamble to Directive 2006/24, \u2018[s]everal Member States have adopted legislation providing for the retention of data by service providers for the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offences\u2019.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a07 to 11 in the preamble to Directive 2006/24 read as follows:\n\u2018(7) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 19\u00a0December 2002 underline that, because of the significant growth in the possibilities afforded by electronic communications, data relating to the use of electronic communications are particularly important and therefore a valuable tool in the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, in particular organised crime.\n(8) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Declaration on Combating Terrorism adopted by the European Council on 25\u00a0March 2004 instructed the Council to examine measures for establishing rules on the retention of communications traffic data by service providers. \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a08 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) [signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950], everyone has the right to respect for his private life and his correspondence. Public authorities may interfere with the exercise of that right only in accordance with the law and where necessary in a democratic society, inter alia, in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Because retention of data has proved to be such a necessary and effective investigative tool for law enforcement in several Member States, and in particular concerning serious matters such as organised crime and terrorism, it is necessary to ensure that retained data are made available to law enforcement authorities for a certain period, subject to the conditions provided for in this Directive. \u2026\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 13\u00a0July 2005, the Council reaffirmed in its declaration condemning the terrorist attacks on London the need to adopt common measures on the retention of telecommunications data as soon as possible. \n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the importance of traffic and location data for the investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offences, as demonstrated by research and the practical experience of several Member States, there is a need to ensure at European level that data that are generated or processed, in the course of the supply of communications services, by providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of a public communications network are retained for a certain period, subject to the conditions provided for in this Directive.\u2019\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a016, 21 and 22 in the preamble to Directive 2006/24 state:\n\u2018(16)\u00a0The obligations incumbent on service providers concerning measures to ensure data quality, which derive from Article\u00a06 of Directive 95/46/EC, and their obligations concerning measures to ensure confidentiality and security of processing of data, which derive from Articles\u00a016 and 17 of that Directive, apply in full to data being retained within the meaning of this Directive.\n(21) \u00a0Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to harmonise the obligations on providers to retain certain data and to ensure that those data are available for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each Member State in its national law, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of this Directive, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article\u00a05 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(22) \u00a0This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised, in particular, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this Directive, together with Directive 2002/58/EC, seeks to ensure full compliance with citizens' fundamental rights to respect for private life and communications and to the protection of their personal data, as enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\u2019\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2006/24 lays down the obligation on the providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks to retain certain data which are generated or processed by them. In that context, Articles\u00a01 to 9, 11 and 13 of the directive state:\n\u2018Article\u00a01\nSubject matter and scope\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive aims to harmonise Member States\u2019 provisions concerning the obligations of the providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks with respect to the retention of certain data which are generated or processed by them, in order to ensure that the data are available for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each Member State in its national law.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive shall apply to traffic and location data on both legal entities and natural persons and to the related data necessary to identify the subscriber or registered user.

It challenged the legality of national legislative and administrative measures concerning the retention of data relating to electronic communications and asked the national court, in particular, to declare the invalidity of Directive 2006/24 and of Part\u00a07 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act\u00a02005, which requires telephone communications service providers to retain traffic and location data relating to those providers for a period specified by law in order to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute crime and safeguard the security of the State. \n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The High Court, considering that it was not able to resolve the questions raised relating to national law unless the validity of Directive 2006/24 had first been examined, decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the restriction on the rights of the [p]laintiff in respect of its use of mobile telephony arising from the requirements of Articles\u00a03, 4 \u2026 and 6 of Directive 2006/24/EC incompatible with [Article\u00a05(4)] TEU in that it is disproportionate and unnecessary or inappropriate to achieve the legitimate aims of:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ensuring that certain data are available for the purposes of investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime?\nand/or\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market of the European Union?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specifically,\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Directive 2006/24 compatible with the right of citizens to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States laid down in Article\u00a021 TFEU?\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Directive 2006/24 compatible with the right to privacy laid down in Article\u00a07 of the [Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u201cthe Charter\u201d)] and Article\u00a08 ECHR?\n(iii)\u00a0Is Directive 2006/24 compatible with the right to the protection of personal data laid down in Article\u00a08 of the Charter?\n(iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Directive 2006/24 compatible with the right to freedom of expression laid down in Article\u00a011 of the Charter and Article\u00a010 ECHR?\n(v)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Directive 2006/24 compatible with the right to [g]ood [a]dministration laid down in Article\u00a041 of the Charter?\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To what extent do the Treaties\u00a0\u2014 and specifically the principle of loyal cooperation laid down in [Article\u00a04(3) TEU]\u00a0\u2014 require a national court to inquire into, and assess, the compatibility of the national implementing measures for [Directive 2006/24] with the protections afforded by the [Charter], including Article\u00a07 thereof (as informed by Article\u00a08 of the ECHR)?\u2019 \n\u00a0\nCase C\u2013594/12\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The origin of the request for a preliminary ruling in Case C-594/12 lies in several actions brought before the Verfassungsgerichtshof by the K\u00e4rntner Landesregierung and by Mr\u00a0Seitlinger, Mr\u00a0Tschohl and 11\u00a0128 other applicants, respectively, seeking the annulment of Paragraph\u00a0102a of the 2003 Law on telecommunications (Telekommunikationsgesetz 2003), which was inserted into that 2003 Law by the federal law amending it (Bundesgesetz, mit dem das Telekommunikationsgesetz 2003\u00a0\u2014 TKG 2003 ge\u00e4ndert wird, BGBl I, 27/2011) for the purpose of transposing Directive 2006/24 into Austrian national law. They take the view, inter alia, that Article\u00a0102a of the Telekommunikationsgesetz 2003 infringes the fundamental right of individuals to the protection of their data. \n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verfassungsgerichtshof wonders, in particular, whether Directive 2006/24 is compatible with the Charter in so far as it allows the storing of many types of data in relation to an unlimited number of persons for a long time. The Verfassungsgerichtshof takes the view that the retention of data affects almost exclusively persons whose conduct in no way justifies the retention of data relating to them. Those persons are exposed to a greater risk that authorities will investigate the data relating to them, become acquainted with the content of those data, find out about their private lives and use those data for multiple purposes, having regard in particular to the unquantifiable number of persons having access to the data for a minimum period of six months. According to the referring court, there are doubts as to whether that directive is able to achieve the objectives which it pursues and as to the proportionality of the interference with the fundamental rights concerned. \n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the Verfassungsgerichtshof decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concerning the validity of acts of institutions of the European Union:\nAre Articles\u00a03 to 9 of [Directive 2006/24] compatible with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 of the [Charter]?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concerning the interpretation of the Treaties:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the explanations relating to Article\u00a08 of the Charter, which, according to Article\u00a052(7) of the Charter, were drawn up as a way of providing guidance in the interpretation of the Charter and to which regard must be given by the Verfassungsgerichtshof, must [Directive 95/46] and Regulation (EC) No\u00a045/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council [of 18\u00a0December 2000] on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data [OJ 2001 L\u00a08, p.\u00a01] be taken into account, for the purposes of assessing the permissibility of interference, as being of equal standing to the conditions under Article\u00a08(2) and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is the relationship between \u201cUnion law\u201d, as referred to in the final sentence of Article\u00a052(3) of the Charter, and the directives in the field of the law on data protection?\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the fact that [Directive 95/26] and Regulation \u2026 No\u00a045/2001 contain conditions and restrictions with a view to safeguarding the fundamental right to data protection under the Charter, must amendments resulting from subsequent secondary law be taken into account for the purpose of interpreting Article\u00a08 of the Charter?\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to Article\u00a052(4) of the Charter, does it follow from the principle of the preservation of higher levels of protection in Article\u00a053 of the Charter that the limits applicable under the Charter in relation to permissible restrictions must be more narrowly circumscribed by secondary law?\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to Article\u00a052(3) of the Charter, the fifth paragraph in the preamble thereto and the explanations in relation to Article\u00a07 of the Charter, according to which the rights guaranteed in that article correspond to those guaranteed by Article\u00a08 of the [ECHR], can assistance be derived from the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights for the purpose of interpreting Article\u00a08 of the Charter such as to influence the interpretation of that latter article?\u2019\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of the President of the Court of 11\u00a0June 2013, Cases C-293/12 and C-594/12 were joined for the purposes of the oral procedure and the judgment. \n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe second question, parts (b) to (d), in Case C-293/12 and the first question in Case C-594/12\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the second question, parts (b) to (d), in Case C-293/12 and the first question in Case C-594/12, which should be examined together, the referring courts are essentially asking the Court to examine the validity of Directive 2006/24 in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 of the Charter. \n\u00a0The relevance of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 of the Charter with regard to the question of the validity of Directive 2006/24\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from Article\u00a01 and recitals\u00a04, 5, 7 to 11, 21 and 22 of Directive 2006/24 that the main objective of that directive is to harmonise Member States\u2019 provisions concerning the retention, by providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks, of certain data which are generated or processed by them, in order to ensure that the data are available for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, such as organised crime and terrorism, in compliance with the rights laid down in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The obligation, under Article\u00a03 of Directive 2006/24, on providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks to retain the data listed in Article\u00a05 of the directive for the purpose of making them accessible, if necessary, to the competent national authorities raises questions relating to respect for private life and communications under Article\u00a07 of the Charter, the protection of personal data under Article\u00a08 of the Charter and respect for freedom of expression under Article\u00a011 of the Charter. \n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be observed that the data which providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks must retain, pursuant to Articles\u00a03 and 5 of Directive 2006/24, include data necessary to trace and identify the source of a communication and its destination, to identify the date, time, duration and type of a communication, to identify users\u2019 communication equipment, and to identify the location of mobile communication equipment, data which consist, inter alia, of the name and address of the subscriber or registered user, the calling telephone number, the number called and an IP address for Internet services. Those data make it possible, in particular, to know the identity of the person with whom a subscriber or registered user has communicated and by what means, and to identify the time of the communication as well as the place from which that communication took place. They also make it possible to know the frequency of the communications of the subscriber or registered user with certain persons during a given period. \n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those data, taken as a whole, may allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data has been retained, such as the habits of everyday life, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social relationships of those persons and the social environments frequented by them. \n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In such circumstances, even though, as is apparent from Article\u00a01(2) and Article\u00a05(2) of Directive 2006/24, the directive does not permit the retention of the content of the communication or of information consulted using an electronic communications network, it is not inconceivable that the retention of the data in question might have an effect on the use, by subscribers or registered users, of the means of communication covered by that directive and, consequently, on their exercise of the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article\u00a011 of the Charter. \n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The retention of data for the purpose of possible access to them by the competent national authorities, as provided for by Directive 2006/24, directly and specifically affects private life and, consequently, the rights guaranteed by Article\u00a07 of the Charter. Furthermore, such a retention of data also falls under Article\u00a08 of the Charter because it constitutes the processing of personal data within the meaning of that article and, therefore, necessarily has to satisfy the data protection requirements arising from that article (Cases C-92/09 and C-93/09 \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert \nEU:C:2010:662, paragraph\u00a047).\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the references for a preliminary ruling in the present cases raise, in particular, the question of principle as to whether or not, in the light of Article\u00a07 of the Charter, the data of subscribers and registered users may be retained, they also concern the question of principle as to whether Directive 2006/24 meets the requirements for the protection of personal data arising from Article\u00a08 of the Charter. \n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, it is appropriate, for the purposes of answering the second question, parts (b) to (d), in Case C-293/12 and the first question in Case C-594/12, to examine the validity of the directive in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n\u00a0Interference with the rights laid down in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By requiring the retention of the data listed in Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2006/24 and by allowing the competent national authorities to access those data, Directive 2006/24, as the Advocate General has pointed out, in particular, in paragraphs\u00a039 and 40 of his Opinion, derogates from the system of protection of the right to privacy established by Directives 95/46 and 2002/58 with regard to the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector, directives which provided for the confidentiality of communications and of traffic data as well as the obligation to erase or make those data anonymous where they are no longer needed for the purpose of the transmission of a communication, unless they are necessary for billing purposes and only for as long as so necessary. \n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To establish the existence of an interference with the fundamental right to privacy, it does not matter whether the information on the private lives concerned is sensitive or whether the persons concerned have been inconvenienced in any way (see, to that effect, Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others \nEU:C:2003:294, paragraph\u00a075). \n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a result, the obligation imposed by Articles\u00a03 and 6 of Directive 2006/24 on providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks to retain, for a certain period, data relating to a person\u2019s private life and to his communications, such as those referred to in Article\u00a05 of the directive, constitutes in itself an interference with the rights guaranteed by Article\u00a07 of the Charter. \n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the access of the competent national authorities to the data constitutes a further interference with that fundamental right (see, as regards Article\u00a08 of the ECHR, Eur. Court H.R., \nLeander v. Sweden\n, 26\u00a0March 1987, \u00a7 48, Series A no\u00a0116; \nRotaru v. Romania \n[GC], no.\u00a028341/95, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2000-V; and \nWeber and Saravia v.

Accordingly, Articles\u00a04 and 8 of Directive 2006/24 laying down rules relating to the access of the competent national authorities to the data also constitute an interference with the rights guaranteed by Article\u00a07 of the Charter. \n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, Directive 2006/24 constitutes an interference with the fundamental right to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Article\u00a08 of the Charter because it provides for the processing of personal data.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be stated that the interference caused by Directive 2006/24 with the fundamental rights laid down in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter is, as the Advocate General has also pointed out, in particular, in paragraphs\u00a077 and 80 of his Opinion, wide-ranging, and it must be considered to be particularly serious. Furthermore, as the Advocate General has pointed out in paragraphs\u00a052 and 72 of his Opinion, the fact that data are retained and subsequently used without the subscriber or registered user being informed is likely to generate in the minds of the persons concerned the feeling that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance. \n\u00a0Justification of the interference with the rights guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter provides that any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms laid down by the Charter must be provided for by law, respect their essence and, subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made to those rights and freedoms only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others. \n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns the essence of the fundamental right to privacy and the other rights laid down in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, it must be held that, even though the retention of data required by Directive 2006/24 constitutes a particularly serious interference with those rights, it is not such as to adversely affect the essence of those rights given that, as follows from Article\u00a01(2) of the directive, the directive does not permit the acquisition of knowledge of the content of the electronic communications as such.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is that retention of data such as to adversely affect the essence of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data enshrined in Article\u00a08 of the Charter, because Article\u00a07 of Directive 2006/24 provides, in relation to data protection and data security, that, without prejudice to the provisions adopted pursuant to Directives 95/46 and 2002/58, certain principles of data protection and data security must be respected by providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks. According to those principles, Member States are to ensure that appropriate technical and organisational measures are adopted against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration of the data.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the question of whether that interference satisfies an objective of general interest, it should be observed that, whilst Directive 2006/24 aims to harmonise Member States\u2019 provisions concerning the obligations of those providers with respect to the retention of certain data which are generated or processed by them, the material objective of that directive is, as follows from Article\u00a01(1) thereof, to ensure that the data are available for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each Member State in its national law. The material objective of that directive is, therefore, to contribute to the fight against serious crime and thus, ultimately, to public security.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the case-law of the Court that the fight against international terrorism in order to maintain international peace and security constitutes an objective of general interest (see, to that effect, Cases C-402/05\u00a0P and C-415/05\u00a0P \nKadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation\n v \nCouncil and Commission\n EU:C:2008:461, paragraph\u00a0363, and Cases C-539/10\u00a0P and C-550/10\u00a0P \nAl-Aqsa\n v \nCouncil\n EU:C:2012:711, paragraph\u00a0130). The same is true of the fight against serious crime in order to ensure public security (see, to that effect, Case C-145/09 \nTsakouridis \nEU:C:2010:708, paragraphs\u00a046 and 47). Furthermore, it should be noted, in this respect, that Article\u00a06 of the Charter lays down the right of any person not only to liberty, but also to security. \n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it is apparent from recital\u00a07 in the preamble to Directive 2006/24 that, because of the significant growth in the possibilities afforded by electronic communications, the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 19\u00a0December 2002 concluded that data relating to the use of electronic communications are particularly important and therefore a valuable tool in the prevention of offences and the fight against crime, in particular organised crime. \n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must therefore be held that the retention of data for the purpose of allowing the competent national authorities to have possible access to those data, as required by Directive 2006/24, genuinely satisfies an objective of general interest.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it is necessary to verify the proportionality of the interference found to exist.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, according to the settled case-law of the Court, the principle of proportionality requires that acts of the EU institutions be appropriate for attaining the legitimate objectives pursued by the legislation at issue and do not exceed the limits of what is appropriate and necessary in order to achieve those objectives (see, to that effect, Case C-343/09 \nAfton Chemical \nEU:C:2010:419, paragraph\u00a045; \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n EU:C:2010:662, paragraph\u00a074; Cases C-581/10 and C-629/10 \nNelson and Others\n EU:C:2012:657, paragraph\u00a071; Case C-283/11 \nSky \u00d6sterreich\n EU:C:2013:28, paragraph\u00a050; and Case C-101/12 \nSchaible\n EU:C:2013:661, paragraph\u00a029).\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to judicial review of compliance with those conditions, where interferences with fundamental rights are at issue, the extent of the EU legislature\u2019s discretion may prove to be limited, depending on a number of factors, including, in particular, the area concerned, the nature of the right at issue guaranteed by the Charter, the nature and seriousness of the interference and the object pursued by the interference (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a08 of the ECHR, Eur. Court H.R., \nS.\u00a0and Marper v. the United Kingdom \n[GC], nos.\u00a030562/04 and 30566/04, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2008-V).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, in view of the important role played by the protection of personal data in the light of the fundamental right to respect for private life and the extent and seriousness of the interference with that right caused by Directive 2006/24, the EU legislature\u2019s discretion is reduced, with the result that review of that discretion should be strict.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the question of whether the retention of data is appropriate for attaining the objective pursued by Directive 2006/24, it must be held that, having regard to the growing importance of means of electronic communication, data which must be retained pursuant to that directive allow the national authorities which are competent for criminal prosecutions to have additional opportunities to shed light on serious crime and, in this respect, they are therefore a valuable tool for criminal investigations. Consequently, the retention of such data may be considered to be appropriate for attaining the objective pursued by that directive. \n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That assessment cannot be called into question by the fact relied upon in particular by Mr\u00a0Tschohl and Mr\u00a0Seitlinger and by the Portuguese Government in their written observations submitted to the Court that there are several methods of electronic communication which do not fall within the scope of Directive 2006/24 or which allow anonymous communication. Whilst, admittedly, that fact is such as to limit the ability of the data retention measure to attain the objective pursued, it is not, however, such as to make that measure inappropriate, as the Advocate General has pointed out in paragraph\u00a0137 of his Opinion. \n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the necessity for the retention of data required by Directive 2006/24, it must be held that the fight against serious crime, in particular against organised crime and terrorism, is indeed of the utmost importance in order to ensure public security and its effectiveness may depend to a great extent on the use of modern investigation techniques. However, such an objective of general interest, however fundamental it may be, does not, in itself, justify a retention measure such as that established by Directive 2006/24 being considered to be necessary for the purpose of that fight.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns the right to respect for private life, the protection of that fundamental right requires, according to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, in any event, that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (Case C-473/12 \nIPI\n EU:C:2013:715, paragraph\u00a039 and the case-law cited).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that the protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article\u00a08(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the EU legislation in question must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and imposing minimum safeguards so that the persons whose data have been retained have sufficient guarantees to effectively protect their personal data against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access and use of that data (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a08 of the ECHR, Eur. Court H.R., \nLiberty and Others v. the United Kingdom\n, 1\u00a0July 2008, no.\u00a058243/00, \u00a7 62 and 63; \nRotaru v. Romania\n, \u00a7 57 to 59, and \nS.\u00a0and Marper v. the United Kingdom\n, \u00a7 99).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The need for such safeguards is all the greater where, as laid down in Directive 2006/24, personal data are subjected to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to those data (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a08 of the ECHR, \nS.\u00a0and Marper v. the United Kingdom\n, \u00a7 103, and \nM.\u00a0K.\u00a0v. France\n, 18\u00a0April 2013, no.\u00a019522/09, \u00a7 35).\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the question of whether the interference caused by Directive 2006/24 is limited to what is strictly necessary, it should be observed that, in accordance with Article\u00a03 read in conjunction with Article\u00a05(1) of that directive, the directive requires the retention of all traffic data concerning fixed telephony, mobile telephony, Internet access, Internet e-mail and Internet telephony. It therefore applies to all means of electronic communication, the use of which is very widespread and of growing importance in people\u2019s everyday lives. Furthermore, in accordance with Article\u00a03 of Directive 2006/24, the directive covers all subscribers and registered users. It therefore entails an interference with the fundamental rights of practically the entire European population. \n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it must be noted, first, that Directive 2006/24 covers, in a generalised manner, all persons and all means of electronic communication as well as all traffic data without any differentiation, limitation or exception being made in the light of the objective of fighting against serious crime. \n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2006/24 affects, in a comprehensive manner, all persons using electronic communications services, but without the persons whose data are retained being, even indirectly, in a situation which is liable to give rise to criminal prosecutions. It therefore applies even to persons for whom there is no evidence capable of suggesting that their conduct might have a link, even an indirect or remote one, with serious crime. Furthermore, it does not provide for any exception, with the result that it applies even to persons whose communications are subject, according to rules of national law, to the obligation of professional secrecy. \n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, whilst seeking to contribute to the fight against serious crime, Directive 2006/24 does not require any relationship between the data whose retention is provided for and a threat to public security and, in particular, it is not restricted to a retention in relation (i) to data pertaining to a particular time period and/or a particular geographical zone and/or to a circle of particular persons likely to be involved, in one way or another, in a serious crime, or (ii) to persons who could, for other reasons, contribute, by the retention of their data, to the prevention, detection or prosecution of serious offences. \n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, not only is there a general absence of limits in Directive 2006/24 but Directive 2006/24 also fails to lay down any objective criterion by which to determine the limits of the access of the competent national authorities to the data and their subsequent use for the purposes of prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions concerning offences that, in view of the extent and seriousness of the interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, may be considered to be sufficiently serious to justify such an interference. On the contrary, Directive 2006/24 simply refers, in Article\u00a01(1), in a general manner to serious crime, as defined by each Member State in its national law.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Directive 2006/24 does not contain substantive and procedural conditions relating to the access of the competent national authorities to the data and to their subsequent use. Article\u00a04 of the directive, which governs the access of those authorities to the data retained, does not expressly provide that that access and the subsequent use of the data in question must be strictly restricted to the purpose of preventing and detecting precisely defined serious offences or of conducting criminal prosecutions relating thereto; it merely provides that each Member State is to define the procedures to be followed and the conditions to be fulfilled in order to gain access to the retained data in accordance with necessity and proportionality requirements.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, Directive 2006/24 does not lay down any objective criterion by which the number of persons authorised to access and subsequently use the data retained is limited to what is strictly necessary in the light of the objective pursued. Above all, the access by the competent national authorities to the data retained is not made dependent on a prior review carried out by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision seeks to limit access to the data and their use to what is strictly necessary for the purpose of attaining the objective pursued and which intervenes following a reasoned request of those authorities submitted within the framework of procedures of prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions. Nor does it lay down a specific obligation on Member States designed to establish such limits. \n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, so far as concerns the data retention period, Article\u00a06 of Directive 2006/24 requires that those data be retained for a period of at least six months, without any distinction being made between the categories of data set out in Article\u00a05 of that directive on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, that period is set at between a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 24 months, but it is not stated that the determination of the period of retention must be based on objective criteria in order to ensure that it is limited to what is strictly necessary.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the above that Directive 2006/24 does not lay down clear and precise rules governing the extent of the interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter. It must therefore be held that Directive 2006/24 entails a wide-ranging and particularly serious interference with those fundamental rights in the legal order of the EU, without such an interference being precisely circumscribed by provisions to ensure that it is actually limited to what is strictly necessary.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, as far as concerns the rules relating to the security and protection of data retained by providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks, it must be held that Directive 2006/24 does not provide for sufficient safeguards, as required by Article\u00a08 of the Charter, to ensure effective protection of the data retained against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access and use of that data. In the first place, Article\u00a07 of Directive 2006/24 does not lay down rules which are specific and adapted to (i) the vast quantity of data whose retention is required by that directive, (ii) the sensitive nature of that data and (iii) the risk of unlawful access to that data, rules which would serve, in particular, to govern the protection and security of the data in question in a clear and strict manner in order to ensure their full integrity and confidentiality. Furthermore, a specific obligation on Member States to establish such rules has also not been laid down.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a07 of Directive 2006/24, read in conjunction with Article\u00a04(1) of Directive 2002/58 and the second subparagraph of Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46, does not ensure that a particularly high level of protection and security is applied by those providers by means of technical and organisational measures, but permits those providers in particular to have regard to economic considerations when determining the level of security which they apply, as regards the costs of implementing security measures. In particular, Directive 2006/24 does not ensure the irreversible destruction of the data at the end of the data retention period.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it should be added that that directive does not require the data in question to be retained within the European Union, with the result that it cannot be held that the control, explicitly required by Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter, by an independent authority of compliance with the requirements of protection and security, as referred to in the two previous paragraphs, is fully ensured. Such a control, carried out on the basis of EU law, is an essential component of the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data (see, to that effect, Case C-614/10 \nCommission \nv \nAustria\n EU:C:2012:631, paragraph\u00a037).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, it must be held that, by adopting Directive 2006/24, the EU legislature has exceeded the limits imposed by compliance with the principle of proportionality in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 52(1) of the Charter.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, there is no need to examine the validity of Directive 2006/24 in the light of Article\u00a011 of the Charter.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the answer to the second question, parts (b) to (d), in Case C-293/12 and the first question in Case C-594/12 is that Directive 2006/24 is invalid. \n\u00a0\nThe first question and the second question, parts (a) and (e), and the third question in Case C-293/12 and the second question in Case C-594/12\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from what was held in the previous paragraph that there is no need to answer the first question, the second question, parts (a) and (e), and the third question in Case C-293/12 or the second question in Case C-594/12.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national courts, the decision on costs is a matter for those courts. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\nDirective 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\u00a0March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC is invalid."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

This Regulation applies to passports and travel documents issued by Member States.

For the purpose of this Regulation the biometric features in passports and travel documents shall only be used for verifying: \n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the authenticity of the passport or travel document; \n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the identity of the holder by means of directly available comparable features when the passport or travel document is required to be produced by law.\u2019\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Recital 5 in the preamble to Regulation No\u00a0444/2005, which amended Regulation No\u00a02252/2004:\n\u2018Regulation \u2026 No\u00a02252/2004 requires biometric data to be collected and stored in the storage medium of passports and travel documents with a view to issuing such documents. This is without prejudice to any other use or storage of these data in accordance with national legislation of Member States. Regulation \u2026 No\u00a02252/2004 does not provide a legal base for setting up or maintaining databases for storage of those data in Member States, which is strictly a matter of national law.\u2019\n\u00a0\nNetherlands law\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Article\u00a02(1), introductory, part (a), of the Law laying down the rules for the issue of travel documents (Rijkswet houdende het stellen van regelen betreffende de verstrekking van reisdocumenten) of 26\u00a0September 1991 (Stb. 1991, No\u00a0498, \u2018the Passport Law\u2019), the national passport is one of the travel documents issue by the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Article\u00a02(2) thereof, the Netherlands identity card is a travel document relating to the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, valid for countries which are parties to the European Agreement on Regulations governing the Movement of Persons between Member States of the Council of Europe, adopted in Paris on 13\u00a0December 1957. \n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03(3) of that law, in the version in force at the material time, provides that a travel document must contain a facial image, two fingerprints and the signature of the holder. Article\u00a03(8) thereof states that the competent issuing authorities are required to keep records of the travel documents issued.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a065(1) and (2) of the Passport Law, in the version in force at the material time, provided:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The authority which issues travel documents shall retain the following data in the records referred to in Article\u00a03(8), second sentence:\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fingerprint data referred to in Article\u00a03(3); \nb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0two other fingerprints, as specified by the competent Minister, of the person applying for a travel document;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The data referred to in paragraph\u00a01 may be provided solely to authorities, institutions and individuals charged with the implementation of this law, in so far as they require the data for such implementation.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Passport Law also contains Articles\u00a04a and 4b, but they had not entered into force at the material time, a royal decree being required for that purpose. Article\u00a04a of that law provided that a minister was to keep a central register of travel documents in which the data relating to travel documents are to be stored. That central register was to contain the data referred to in Article\u00a03 of that law and two digital fingerprints from the applicant different than those in the travel document, pursuant to Article\u00a03(3) of that law. Article\u00a04b of the Passport Law set out the conditions under which the data stored in the central register for travel documents could be communicated to other institutions, bodies or persons, in particular, for the purpose of identifying victims of disasters and accidents, the detection and prosecution of criminal offences and for the conduct of investigations of acts constituting a threat to State security.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles\u00a03, 4a, 4b and 65 of the Passport Law were amended with effect from 20\u00a0January 2014. Pursuant to Article\u00a03(9) of that law, inserted following that legislative amendment, digital fingerprints are to be stored only for the duration of the procedure for application and issue of the passport, that is to say until the passport is issued to the holder. After issue of the new passport, the digital fingerprints are to be erased. Articles\u00a04a and 4b of that law have been amended so that they no longer provide for the central storage and communication to third parties of the digital fingerprints taken. Article\u00a065(1) and (2) of that law was repealed and replaced by Article\u00a03(9).\n\u00a0\nThe actions in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Willems and Ms\u00a0Roest and Ms\u00a0van Luijk each made passport applications. In each case, the Burgemeester concerned rejected those applications, since the persons in question had refused to provide digital fingerprints. Mr\u00a0Kooistra made an application for the issue of a Netherlands identity card which was also refused on the ground that he had refused to provide digital fingerprints and a facial image.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicants in the main proceedings refused to provide that biometric data on the ground that creating and storing it constitute a serious breach of their physical integrity and their right to privacy.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the applicants in the main proceedings that breach arises, inter alia, from the storage of that data on three different media. The data is stored not only on the storage medium integrated into the Netherlands passport or identity card, but also on a decentralised database. In addition, data security risks will increase because the Passport Law provides that local authority databases are eventually to be combined into in a centralised database.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, there are no provisions clearly identifying the persons who will have access to biometric data, so that the applicants in the main proceedings will lose control of that data.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, the applicants in the main proceedings submit that in the future the authorities might use biometric data for purposes other than those for which it was provided to them. In particular, the storage of that data in a database might lead to its use for judicial purposes or by the intelligence and security services. It follows from Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 that, for the purposes of the application of that regulation, biometric data, such as digital fingerprints, may be used only in order to verify the authenticity of the document and the identity of the holder. Such use is also contrary to fundamental rights.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since their respective actions against the decisions of the Burgemeesters were rejected at first instance, the applicants in the main proceedings have brought appeals before the referring court.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court asks, first of all, whether, in Case C-447/12, the Netherlands identity card falls within the scope of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004. In that connection, it is clear from EU law on the free movement of persons that an identity card is also a travel document within the European Union. Furthermore, that card enables travel outside the European Union, to EU candidate countries. Moreover, it is conceivable that Article\u00a01(3) thereof may be read as meaning that the concept of \u2018identity card\u2019 for the purposes of that provision must be read together with the expression \u2018having a validity of 12 months or less\u2019 which also appears in that provision. Netherlands identity cards are valid for five years.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, the referring court indicates that the outcome of the cases in the main proceedings will depend on whether the ground relied on by the applicants, according to which the purposes for which the data collected for the issue of a passport or a travel document may be used in the future are unclear, is well founded. \n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, that court asks whether it follows from Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 that it must be guaranteed by law, that is to say, by means of a mandatory rule of general scope, that the biometric data collected on the basis of that regulation may not be used for purposes other than those set out therein.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Raad van State decided to stay the proceedings and to refer two questions for a preliminary ruling in Cases C-446/12, C-448/12 and C-449/12 and three questions in Case C-447/12.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first questions in Cases C-446/12, C-448/12 and C-449/12 and the second question in Case C-447/12 concerned the validity of Article\u00a01(2) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004. They corresponded to the question referred for a preliminary ruling which gave rise to the judgment in \nSchwarz \n(C-291/12, EU:C:2013:670).\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following that judgment, the referring court withdrew the questions mentioned in the preceding paragraph.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the Raad van State maintained the first question referred for a preliminary ruling in Case C-447/12 which is worded as follows:\n\u2018Must Article\u00a01(3) of [Regulation No\u00a02252/2004] be interpreted as meaning that it does not apply to identity cards, such as the Netherlands identity cards, issued by Member States to their nationals, regardless of their period of validity and regardless of the possibilities of using them as travel documents?\u2019\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, the Raad van State maintained the second questions referred in Cases C-446/12, C-448/12 and C-449/12, and the third question in Case C-447/12, which are identical and are worded as follows:\n\u2018\u2026 [M]ust Article\u00a04(3) of Regulation [No 2252/2004], [read] in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [\u201cthe Charter\u201d], Article\u00a08(2) of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms[, signed at Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950,] and Article\u00a07(f) of [Directive 95/46], read in conjunction with Article\u00a06(1)(b) of that directive, be interpreted as meaning that, when the Member States give effect to Regulation No\u00a02252/2004, there should be a statutory guarantee that the biometric data collected and stored pursuant to that regulation may not be collected, processed and used for any purposes other than the issuing of the document concerned?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\u00a0\nThe first question in Case C-447/12\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its question, the referring court asks essentially if Article\u00a01(3) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 must be interpreted as meaning that that regulation is not applicable to identity cards issued by a Member State to its nationals, such as the Netherlands identity cards, irrespective of the period of their validity and irrespective of the possibility to use them for the purposes of travel outside that State.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Article\u00a01(3), second sentence, Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 does not apply to identity cards issued by Member States to their nationals or to temporary passports and to travel documents having a validity of 12 months or less.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it must be established whether the scope of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 varies according to the period of validity of an identity card.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it is clear from Article\u00a01(3), second sentence, of that regulation that that provision restricts the scope of the regulation by excluding from it two categories of documents. Given that those two categories of documents are connected in the text by the conjunction \u2018or\u2019, they must be regarded as being separate from one another.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion is supported by the fact that in several language versions of Article\u00a01(3), second sentence, of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004, and in particular, in the English (\u2018temporary passports and travel documents having a validity of 12 months or less\u2019), German (\u2018vorl\u00e4ufige P\u00e4sse und Reisedokumente mit enier G\u00fcltigkeitsdauer von zw\u00f6lf Monaten oder weniger\u2019) and Dutch (\u2018tijdelijke paspoorten en reisdocumenten die een geldigheidsduur van 12 maanden of minder hebben\u2019) language versions, the expressions \u2018temporary\u2019 and \u2018having a validity of 12 months or less\u2019 do not apply to one of the categories of documents mentioned in the preceding paragraph, namely identity cards issued by the Member States.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it must be stated that the expressions \u2018temporary\u2019 and \u2018having a validity of 12 months or less\u2019 do not concern identity cards issued by the Member States to their nationals.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, according to the wording of Article\u00a01(3) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004, that regulation does not apply to identity cards issued by Member States to their nationals, whether or not they are temporary and whatever the period of their validity.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, that conclusion is reinforced by the \ntravaux pr\u00e9paratoires\n for Regulation No\u00a02252/2004. In particular from Article\u00a01(3) of the Draft Council Regulation on standards for security features and biometrics in travel documents issued by Member States (Council Document No\u00a011489/04 of 26\u00a0July 2004) stated that that regulation is intended to apply \u2018to passports and travel documents with a validity of 12 months or more. It does not apply to identity cards issued by Member States to their nationals\u2019.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it must be established whether the fact that identity cards such as Netherlands identity cards may be used for the purposes of travel within the European Union and to certain non-Member States may bring it within the scope of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it must be observed that it is true that identity cards, such as Netherlands identity cards, may serve as identification of the holder with regard to non-Member States which have concluded bilateral agreements with the Member State concerned, and, in accordance with Articles\u00a04 and 5 of Directive 2004/38, for the purposes of travel between several Member States.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it is clear from the wording of the second sentence of Article\u00a01(3) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004, interpreted in the light of the findings in paragraphs\u00a032 to 37 of the present judgment, that the EU legislature expressly decided to exclude from the scope of that regulation identity cards issued by Member States to their nationals.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the fact that identity cards, such as Netherlands identity cards, may be used for the purposes of travel within the European Union and to a limited number of non-Member States, does not bring them within the scope of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Article\u00a01(3) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 must be interpreted as meaning that that regulation is not applicable to identity cards issued by a Member States to its nationals, such as Netherlands identity cards, regardless of the period of validity and the possibility of using them for the purposes of travel outside that State.\n\u00a0\nThe second questions in Cases C-446/12, C-448/12 and C-449/12, and the third question in Case C-447/12\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By those questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks essentially whether Article\u00a04(3) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004, read together with Articles\u00a06 and 7 of Directive 95/46 and Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that it requires Member States to guarantee that the biometric data collected and stored pursuant to that regulation will not be collected, processed and used for purposes other than the issue of passports or other travel documents.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it must be observed at the outset that, having regard to the answer to the first question in Case C-447/12, it is only necessary to examine the questions raised in relation to Cases C-446/12, C-448/12 and C-449/12.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04(3) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 requires that, in order to issue a passport or travel document, biometric data must be \u2018collected\u2019 and \u2018stored\u2019 on the storage medium integrated into those documents. As regards the \u2018use\u2019 of that data, that provision states that, for the purposes of that regulation, the latter are to be used only for verifying the authenticity of the document or the identity of the holder when the passport or other travel documents are required to be produced by law.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already held, in its judgment in \nSchwarz \n(C-291/12, EU:C:2013:670), that the use and storage of biometric data for the purposes specified in Article\u00a04(3) of that regulation are compatible with the requirements of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards all other uses and storage of that data, it is clear from Article\u00a04(3) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004, which deals with the use of such data \u2018[f]or the purpose of this Regulation\u2019, read in the light of recital 5 in the preamble to Regulation No\u00a0444/2009, which amended Regulation No\u00a02252/2004, that the use and storage of that data are not governed by the latter regulation. That recital states that Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 is without prejudice to any other use or storage of these data in accordance with national legislation of Member States and that it does not provide a legal base for setting up or maintaining databases for storage of those data in Member States, that matter being within the exclusive competence of the Member States.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows, in particular, that Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 does not require a Member State to guarantee in its legislation that biometric data will not be used or stored by that State for purposes other than those mentioned in Article\u00a04(3) of that regulation (see, to that effect, judgment in \nSchwarz\n, C-291/12, EU:C:2013:670, paragraph\u00a061).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, as regards Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, it is clear from the case-law of the Court that the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter must be respected where national legislation falls within the scope of EU law. In other words, the applicability of EU law entails the applicability of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter (judgments in \n\u00c5kerberg Fransson\n, C-617/10, EU:C:2013:105, paragraphs\u00a020 and 22, and \nTexdata Software\n, C-418/11, EU:C:2013:588, paragraphs\u00a071 to 73).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given that, in the present case, Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 is not applicable, there is no need to determine whether the storage and use of biometric data for purposes other than those referred to in Article\u00a04(3) thereof are compatible with those articles of the Charter.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The foregoing considerations are without prejudice to any examination by the national courts of the compatibility of all the national measures relating to the use and storage of biometric data with their national law and, if appropriate, with the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (see, to that effect, judgment in \nSchwarz\n, C-291/12, EU:C:2013:670, paragraph\u00a062).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, as regards Articles\u00a06 and 7 of Directive 95/46, it must be observed that, by its questions, the referring court requests the interpretation of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 and only that regulation. Since it follows from the foregoing considerations that that regulation is not applicable in the present case, there is no need to examine, as a separate matter, whether those articles affect the national legal framework relating to the storage and use of biometric data outside the scope of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004. \n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the answer to the questions referred is that Article\u00a04(3) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 must be interpreted as meaning that it does not require the Member States to guarantee, in their legislation, that biometric data collected and stored in accordance with that regulation will not be collected, processed and used for purposes other than the issue of the passport or travel document, since that is not a matter which falls within the scope of that regulation.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. \nOn those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a01(3) of of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a02252/2004 of 13\u00a0December 2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States, as amended by Regulation (EC) No\u00a0444/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6\u00a0May 2009, must be interpreted as meaning that that regulation is not applicable to identity cards issued by a Member States to its nationals, such as Netherlands identity cards, regardless of the period of validity and the possibility of using them for the purposes of travel outside that State.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a04(3) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004, as amended by Regulation No\u00a0444/2009, must be interpreted as meaning that it does not require the Member States to guarantee, in their legislation, that biometric data collected and stored in accordance with that regulation will not be collected, processed and used for purposes other than the issue of the passport or travel document, since that is not a matter which falls within the scope of that regulation."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 11 Nov 2020, C-61/19 (\nOrange Romania\n)\nGeneral data protection law \n >

2016/679\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a032 and 42 of Regulation 2016/679 state: \n\u2018(32) Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject\u2019s agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject\u2019s acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided.\n\u2026\n(42) Where processing is based on the data subject\u2019s consent, the controller should be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration on another matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact that and the extent to which consent is given. In accordance with Council Directive 93/13/EEC [of 5\u00a0April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts, (OJ 1993 L\u00a095, p.\u00a029)], a declaration of consent pre-formulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language and it should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended. Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\u2019\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04(11) of that regulation provides:\n\u2018\u201cconsent\u201d of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\u2019\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a05 of that regulation provides: \n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Personal data shall be: \n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (\u201clawfulness, fairness and transparency\u201d); \n\u2026\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph\u00a01 (\u201caccountability\u201d).\u2019\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a06(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679:\n\u20181.

According to the ANSPDCP, Orange Rom\u00e2nia has not proven that the customers whose identity documents had been copied and annexed to their contracts had given their valid consent to the collection and storage of copies of their identity documents.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The relevant clauses of the contracts in question read as follows:\n\u2018\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The customer states that:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he or she has been informed, prior to concluding the contract, of the chosen tariff plan, the applicable tariffs, the minimum duration of the contract, the conditions for its termination, the conditions for accessing and using the services, including service coverage areas,\u00a0\u2026;\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Orange Rom\u00e2nia has provided the customer with all the necessary information to enable him or her to give his or her unvitiated, express, free and specific consent to the conclusion and express acceptance of the contract, including all the contractual documentation, the General Terms and Conditions for using Orange\u2019s services and the Brochure of Tariffs and Services;\n(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he or she has been informed of, and has consented to, the following:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the processing of personal data for the purposes referred to in Article\u00a01.15 of the General Terms and Conditions for using Orange\u2019s services;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the storage of copies of documents containing personal data for identification purposes;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the agreement for the processing of personal data (contact number and email address) for direct marketing purposes;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the agreement for the processing of personal data (contact number and email address) for market research purposes;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have read and expressly agree to the storage of copies of documents containing personal data relating to state of health;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the data referred to in Article\u00a01.15(10) of the General Terms and Conditions for Orange\u2019s services are not included in subscriber information and subscriber directory services.\u2019\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Orange Rom\u00e2nia brought an action against the decision of 28\u00a0March 2018 before the Tribunalul Bucure\u015fti (Regional Court, Bucharest, Romania).\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the findings of the referring court, there are both contracts in which a cross has been placed in the box for the clause relating to the storage of copies of documents with personal data for identification purposes and also contracts in which there is no such cross. That court explains that, notwithstanding the stipulations of its General Terms and Conditions, Orange Rom\u00e2nia did not refuse to conclude subscription contracts with customers who refused to consent to the storage of a copy of one of their identity documents. That court also notes that Orange Rom\u00e2nia\u2019s \u2018internal procedures\u2019 relating to sales stated that that refusal had to be set out in a specific form, to be signed by those customers before concluding the contract.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court raises the question whether, in those circumstances, the customers concerned may be regarded as having validly consented to the collection of their identity document and to copies of that document being annexed to the contracts. Furthermore, that court is uncertain whether the signing of a contract with a clause on the storage of copies of documents containing personal data for identification purposes can prove the existence of such consent.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the Tribunalul Bucure\u0219ti (Regional Court, Bucharest) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of Article [2](h) of Directive 95/46, what conditions must be fulfilled in order for an indication of wishes to be regarded as specific and informed?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46, what conditions must be fulfilled in order for an indication of wishes to be regarded as freely given?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary matter, it is appropriate to determine the applicability of Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679 to the facts at issue in the main proceedings.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 95/46 was repealed with effect from 25\u00a0May 2018 and replaced by Regulation 2016/679, in accordance with Article\u00a094(1) and Article\u00a099(2) of that regulation.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, as the decision of the ANSPDCP at issue in the main proceedings was adopted on 28\u00a0March 2018 and, therefore, before 25\u00a0May 2018, the referring court is fully entitled to find that Directive 95/46 applies \nratione temporis\n to the main proceedings.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, it is also apparent from the file before the Court that, by its decision, the ANSPDCP not only imposed a fine on Orange Rom\u00e2nia, but also ordered it to destroy the copies of the identity documents at issue, and that the main proceedings also concern that latter order. As nothing in that file shows that that order was complied with before 25\u00a0May 2018, it is not inconceivable that, in the present case, Regulation 2016/679 is applicable \nratione temporis\n to that order (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2019, \nPlanet49\n, C-673/17, EU:C:2019:801, paragraph\u00a041).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, in order to enable the Court to provide useful answers to the questions submitted by the referring court, those questions must be answered on the basis of both Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679 (see, by analogy, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2019, \nPlanet49\n, C-673/17, EU:C:2019:801, paragraph\u00a043).\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its two questions referred for a preliminary ruling, which should be examined together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a02(h) and Article\u00a07(a) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04(11) and Article\u00a06(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that a contract for the provision of telecommunications services which contains a clause stating that the data subject has been informed of, and has consented to, the collection and storage of a copy of his or her identity document for identification purposes is capable of demonstrating that that person\u2019s consent has been validly given, as provided for in those provisions, to that collection and storage.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that Article\u00a07 of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a06 of Regulation 2016/679 set out an exhaustive list of the cases in which the processing of personal data can be regarded as being lawful (see, regarding Article\u00a07 of Directive 95/46, judgments of 19\u00a0October 2016, \nBreyer\n, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph\u00a057 and the case-law cited, and of 1\u00a0October 2019, \nPlanet49\n, C-673/17, EU:C:2019:801, paragraph\u00a053). In particular, Article\u00a07(a) of that directive and Article\u00a06(1)(a) of that regulation provide that the data subject\u2019s consent may make such processing lawful.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the requirements to which such consent is subject, Article\u00a07(a) of Directive 95/46 provides that the data subject must have \u2018unambiguously given his consent\u2019, while Article\u00a02(h) of that directive defines the term \u2018consent\u2019 as meaning \u2018any freely given specific and informed indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed\u2019. To the extent that those provisions set out that the data subject is to give an \u2018indication of his wishes\u2019 in order to give \u2018unambiguously\u2019 his consent, only active behaviour by that person with a view to giving his or her consent may be relevant (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2019, \nPlanet49\n, C-673/17, EU:C:2019:801, paragraphs\u00a052 and 54).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That same requirement also operates in the context of Regulation 2016/679. Indeed, the wording of Article\u00a04(11) of that regulation, which defines the \u2018consent of the data subject\u2019 for the purposes, inter alia, of Article\u00a06(1)(a) of that regulation, appears even more stringent than Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46, in that it requires a \u2018freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous\u2019 indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes in the form of a statement or by \u2018a clear affirmative action\u2019 signifying agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. Accordingly, active consent is now expressly laid down in Regulation 2016/679 (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2019, \nPlanet49\n, C-673/17, EU:C:2019:801, paragraphs\u00a061 to 63).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, while recital\u00a032 of that regulation states that consent could be given, inter alia, by ticking a box when visiting an internet website, on the contrary, it expressly excludes the possibility that \u2018silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity\u2019 constitute consent. As the Court has held, in such a situation, it would appear impossible in practice to ascertain objectively whether a website user had actually given his or her consent to the processing of his or her personal data by not deselecting a checkbox pre-ticked beforehand nor, in any event, whether that consent had been informed. It is not inconceivable that a user would not have read the information accompanying the preselected checkbox, or even would not have noticed that checkbox, before continuing with his or her activity on the website visited (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2019, \nPlanet49\n, C-673/17, EU:C:2019:801, paragraphs\u00a055 and 57).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04(11) of Regulation 2016/679 require a \u2018specific\u2019 indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes in the sense that it must relate specifically to the processing of the data in question and cannot be inferred from an indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes for other purposes (see, regarding Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2019, \nPlanet49\n, C-673/17, EU:C:2019:801, paragraph\u00a058).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the first sentence of Article\u00a07(2) of that regulation states that if the data subject\u2019s consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent is to be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters. In particular, it is apparent from that provision, read in conjunction with recital\u00a042 of that regulation, that such a declaration must be presented in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular where it concerns a declaration of consent which is to be pre-formulated by the controller of personal data.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the requirement arising from Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04(11) of Regulation 2016/679 that consent must be \u2018informed\u2019, that requirement implies, in accordance with Article\u00a010 of that directive, read in the light of recital\u00a038 thereof, and with Article\u00a013 of that regulation, read in the light of recital\u00a042 thereof, that the controller is to provide the data subject with information relating to all the circumstances surrounding the data processing, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, allowing the data subject to be aware of, inter alia, the type of data to be processed, the identity of the controller, the period and procedures for that processing and the purposes of the processing. Such information must enable the data subject to be able to determine easily the consequences of any consent he or she might give and ensure that the consent given is well informed (see, by analogy, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2019, \nPlanet49\n, C-673/17, EU:C:2019:801, paragraph\u00a074).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as the Commission noted in its observations submitted to the Court, it is clear from the second indent of Article\u00a010(c) of Directive 95/46 and from Article\u00a013(2)(b) and (c) of Regulation 2016/679, read in the light of recital\u00a042 of that regulation, that, in order to ensure that the data subject enjoys genuine freedom of choice, the contractual terms must not mislead him or her as to the possibility of concluding the contract even if he or she refuses to consent to the processing of his or her data. Without information of that kind, the data subject\u2019s consent to the processing of his or her personal data cannot be regarded as having been given freely or, moreover, as having been given in an informed manner.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is appropriate to add that under Article\u00a06(1)(a) and (2) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a05(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, the controller of personal data is required to ensure, inter alia, the lawfulness of the processing of those data and, as stated in Article\u00a05(2) of that regulation, must be able to demonstrate that lawfulness. As regards, more specifically, the data subject\u2019s possible consent, Article\u00a07(a) of that directive provides that the data subject must have \u2018unambiguously\u2019 given his or her consent, which implies, as the Advocate General stated in point\u00a056 of his Opinion, that the controller bears the burden of proof relating to the existence of valid consent. Article\u00a07(1) of that regulation now provides that where processing is based on consent, that controller must be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to the processing of his or her personal data.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, Orange Rom\u00e2nia stated, in its observations to the Court, that, during the procedure for concluding the contracts at issue in the main proceedings, its sales agents informed the customers concerned, before concluding the contracts, inter alia, of the purposes of collecting and storing copies of the identity documents and of their choice as to that collection and storage, before obtaining their oral consent to that collection and storage. According to Orange Rom\u00e2nia, the box relating to the storage of copies of identity documents was therefore ticked solely on the basis of the individuals\u2019 freely expressed agreement to that effect when the contract was concluded.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the request for a preliminary ruling essentially seeks to clarify whether the consent thus invoked as regards such processing of personal data may be established on the basis of the contractual clauses in those contracts.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is apparent from the information set out in that request that, although those contracts contain a clause stating that the customers concerned have been informed of, and have given their consent to, the storage of a copy of their identity document for identification purposes, the box relating to that clause had already been ticked by Orange Rom\u00e2nia\u2019s sales agents before those customers signed in acceptance of all the clauses, that is to say, both of that clause and of clauses not linked to data protection. The request further states that although not specified in the contracts at issue in the main proceedings, Orange Rom\u00e2nia agreed to conclude those contracts with customers who refused to consent to a copy of their identity document being stored, and at the same time required in that case that those customers sign a specific form setting out their refusal.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since, according to the information in the request for a preliminary ruling, the customers concerned do not appear to have themselves ticked the box relating to that clause, the mere fact that that box was ticked is not such as to establish a positive indication of those customers\u2019 consent to a copy of their identity card being collected and stored. As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a045 of his Opinion, the fact that those customers signed the contracts containing the ticked box does not, on its own, prove such consent, in the absence of any indications confirming that that clause was actually read and digested. It is for the referring court to carry out the necessary investigations to that end.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, to the extent that the ticked clause relating to the processing of those data does not appear to have been presented in a form which clearly distinguishes it from the other contractual clauses, it is for that court to assess, in the light of the considerations in paragraph\u00a034 above, whether the signature to those contracts relating to a number of contractual clauses may be regarded as indicating specific consent to the collection and storage of personal data, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04(11) of Regulation 2016/679.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, since the contractual clause at issue in the main proceedings merely states, without giving any further details, that storage of the copies of the identity cards is for identification purposes, it is for the referring court to ascertain whether the information provided to the data subjects satisfies the requirements of Article\u00a010 of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a013 of Regulation 2016/679, which set out the information which the controller must provide to a data subject when collecting data which concern that person in order to ensure fair processing of data with regard to him or her.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also for the referring court to assess, in particular, whether the contractual terms at issue in the main proceedings were capable of misleading the data subject as to the possibility of concluding the contract notwithstanding a refusal to consent to the processing of his or her data, in the absence of specific details on that point, thereby calling into question the informed nature of the consent expressed by the signature.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a060 of his Opinion, the free nature of that consent appears to be called into question by the fact that, if that consent is refused, Orange Rom\u00e2nia, departing from the normal procedure for concluding the contract, required the customer concerned to declare in writing that he or she did not consent to a copy of his or her identity document being collected or stored. As the Commission observed at the hearing, such an additional requirement is liable to affect unduly the freedom to choose to object to that collection and storage, which it is also for the referring court to determine.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, as is apparent from the considerations set out in paragraphs\u00a035, 36 and 42 above, it is for Orange Rom\u00e2nia, as the data controller, to establish that its customers have, by active behaviour, given their consent to the processing of their personal data, with the result that that company cannot require them actively to express their refusal.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the questions referred is that Article\u00a02(h) and Article\u00a07(a) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04(11) and Article\u00a06(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that it is for the data controller to demonstrate that the data subject has, by active behaviour, given his or her consent to the processing of his or her personal data and that he or she has obtained, beforehand, information relating to all the circumstances surrounding that processing, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, allowing that person easily to understand the consequences of that consent, so that it is given with full knowledge of the facts. A contract for the provision of telecommunications services which contains a clause stating that the data subject has been informed of, and has consented to, the collection and storage of a copy of his or her identity document for identification purposes is not such as to demonstrate that that person has validly given his or her consent, as provided for in those provisions, to that collection and storage, where \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the box referring to that clause has been ticked by the data controller before the contract was signed, or where\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the terms of that contract are capable of misleading the data subject as to the possibility of concluding the contract in question even if he or she refuses to consent to the processing of his or her data, or where \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the freedom to choose to object to that collection and storage is unduly affected by that controller in requiring that the data subject, in order to refuse consent, must complete an additional form setting out that refusal.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a02(h) and Article\u00a07(a) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and Article\u00a04(11) and Article\u00a06(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), must be interpreted as meaning that it is for the data controller to demonstrate that the data subject has, by active behaviour, given his or her consent to the processing of his or her personal data and that he or she has obtained, beforehand, information relating to all the circumstances surrounding that processing, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, allowing that person easily to understand the consequences of that consent, so that it is given with full knowledge of the facts. A contract for the provision of telecommunications services which contains a clause stating that the data subject has been informed of, and has consented to, the collection and storage of a copy of his or her identity document for identification purposes is not such as to demonstrate that that person has validly given his or her consent, as provided for in those provisions, to that collection and storage, where\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nthe box referring to that clause has been ticked by the data controller before the contract was signed, or where\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nthe terms of that contract are capable of misleading the data subject as to the possibility of concluding the contract in question even if he or she refuses to consent to the processing of his or her data, or where \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nthe freedom to choose to object to that collection and storage is unduly affected by that controller, in requiring that the data subject, in order to refuse consent, must complete an additional form setting out that refusal."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Thus, for example, photos, videos, news and the Facebook \u2018Like\u2019 button at issue in the present case can be linked to a website and appear there. If a website operator intends to embed such third-party content, he places a link to the external content on that website. When the browser of a visitor to that website encounters such a link, it requests the content from the third-party provider and adds it to the appearance of the website at the desired place. For this to occur, the browser transmits to the server of the third-party provider the IP address of that visitor\u2019s computer, as well as the browser\u2019s technical data, so that the server can establish the format in which the content is to be delivered to that address. In addition, the browser transmits information relating to the desired content. The operator of a website embedding third-party content onto that website cannot control what data the browser transmits or what the third-party provider does with those data, in particular whether it decides to save and use them.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard, in particular, to the Facebook \u2018Like\u2019 button, it seems to be apparent from the order for reference that, when a visitor consults the website of Fashion\u00a0ID, that visitor\u2019s personal data are transmitted to Facebook Ireland as a result of that website including that button. It seems that that transmission occurs without that visitor being aware of it regardless of whether or not he or she is a member of the social network Facebook or has clicked on the Facebook \u2018Like\u2019 button.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Verbraucherzentrale NRW, a public-service association tasked with safeguarding the interests of consumers, criticises Fashion\u00a0ID for transmitting to Facebook Ireland personal data belonging to visitors to its website, first, without their consent and, second, in breach of the duties to inform set out in the provisions relating to the protection of personal data.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Verbraucherzentrale NRW brought legal proceedings for an injunction before the Landgericht D\u00fcsseldorf (Regional Court, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany) against Fashion\u00a0ID to force it to stop that practice.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 9\u00a0March 2016, the Landgericht D\u00fcsseldorf (Regional Court, D\u00fcsseldorf) upheld in part the requests made by Verbraucherzentrale NRW, after having found that it has standing to bring proceedings under Paragraph\u00a08(3)(3) of the UWG.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fashion\u00a0ID brought an appeal against that decision before the referring court, the Oberlandesgericht D\u00fcsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany). Facebook Ireland intervened in that appeal in support of Fashion\u00a0ID. Verbraucherzentrale NRW brought a cross-appeal seeking an extension of the ruling made against Fashion\u00a0ID at first instance.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fashion\u00a0ID argues before the referring court that the decision of the Landgericht D\u00fcsseldorf (Regional Court, D\u00fcsseldorf) is incompatible with Directive 95/46.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Fashion\u00a0ID claims that Articles\u00a022 to 24 of that directive envisage granting legal remedies only to data subjects whose personal data are processed and the competent supervising authorities. Consequently, it argues, the action brought by Verbraucherzentrale NRW is inadmissible due to the fact that that association does not have standing to bring or defend legal proceedings under Directive 95/46.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Fashion\u00a0ID asserts that the Landgericht D\u00fcsseldorf (Regional Court, D\u00fcsseldorf) erred in finding that it was a controller, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46, since it has no influence either over the data transmitted by the visitor\u2019s browser from its website or over whether and, where applicable, how Facebook Ireland uses those data.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, the referring court has doubts whether Directive 95/46 gives public-service associations the right to bring or defend legal proceedings in order to defend the interests of persons who have suffered harm. It takes the view that Article\u00a024 of that directive does not preclude associations from being a party to legal proceedings, since, pursuant to that article, Member States are required to adopt \u2018suitable measures\u2019 to ensure the full implementation of that directive. Thus, the referring court concludes that national legislation allowing associations to bring legal proceedings in the interest of consumers may constitute such a \u2018suitable measure\u2019.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court notes, in this regard, that Article\u00a080(2) of Regulation 2016/679, which repealed and replaced Directive 95/46, expressly authorises the bringing of legal proceedings by such an association, which would tend to confirm that the latter directive did not preclude such an action.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, that court is uncertain whether the operator of a website, such as Fashion\u00a0ID, that embeds on that website a social plugin allowing personal data to be collected can be considered to be a controller within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 despite the latter having no control over the processing of the data transmitted to the provider of that plugin. In this context, the referring court refers to the case that gave rise to the judgment of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n (C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388), which dealt with a similar question.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the alternative, in the event that Fashion\u00a0ID is not to be considered to be a controller, the referring court is uncertain whether that directive exhaustively regulates that notion, such that it precludes national legislation that establishes civil liability for a third party who infringes data protection rights. The referring court asserts that it would be possible to envisage Fashion\u00a0ID being liable on this basis under national law as a \u2018disrupter\u2019 (\u2018\nSt\u00f6rer\n\u2019).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Fashion\u00a0ID had to be considered to be a controller or was at least liable as a \u2018disrupter\u2019 for any data protection infringements by Facebook Ireland, the referring court is uncertain whether the processing of the personal data at issue in the main proceedings is lawful and whether the duty to inform the data subject under Article\u00a010 of Directive 95/46 rests with Fashion\u00a0ID or with Facebook Ireland.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, first, with regard to the conditions for the lawfulness of the processing of data as provided for in Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, the referring court expresses uncertainty as to whether, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, it is appropriate to take into account the legitimate interest of the operator of the website or that of the provider of the social plugin.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, that court is unsure who is required to obtain the consent of and inform the data subjects whose personal data are processed in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings. The referring court takes the view that the matter of who is obliged to inform the persons concerned, as provided for in Article\u00a010 of Directive 95/46, is particularly important given that any embedding of third-party content on a website gives rise, in principle, to the processing of personal data, the scope and purpose of which are, however, unknown to the person embedding that content, namely the operator of the website concerned. That operator could not, therefore, provide the information required, to the extent that it is required to, meaning that the imposition of an obligation on the operator to inform the data subjects would, in practice, amount to a prohibition on the embedding of third-party content.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Oberlandesgericht D\u00fcsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, D\u00fcsseldorf) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do the rules in Articles\u00a022, 23 and 24 of Directive [95/46] preclude national legislation which, in addition to the powers of intervention conferred on the data-protection authorities and the remedies available to the data subject, grants public-service associations the power to take action against the infringer in the event of an infringement in order to safeguard the interests of consumers?\nIf Question 1 is answered in the negative:\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a case such as the present one, in which someone has embedded a programming code in his website which causes the user\u2019s browser to request content from a third party and, to this end, transmits personal data to the third party, is the person embedding the content the \u201ccontroller\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive [95/46] if that person is himself unable to influence this data-processing operation?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question 2 is answered in the negative: Is Article\u00a02(d) of Directive [95/46] to be interpreted as meaning that it definitively regulates liability and responsibility in such a way that it precludes civil claims against a third party who, although not a \u201ccontroller\u201d, nonetheless creates the cause for the processing operation, without influencing it?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whose \u201clegitimate interests\u201d, in a situation such as the present one, are the decisive ones in the balancing of interests to be undertaken pursuant to Article\u00a07(f) of Directive [95/46]? Is it the interests in embedding third-party content or the interests of the third party?\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To whom must the consent to be declared under Articles\u00a07(a) and 2(h) of Directive [95/46] be given in a situation such as that in the present case?\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the duty to inform under Article\u00a010 of Directive [95/46] also apply in a situation such as that in the present case to the operator of the website who has embedded the content of a third party and thus creates the cause for the processing of personal data by the third party?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question the referring court asks, in essence, whether Articles\u00a022 to 24 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which allows consumer-protection associations to bring or defend legal proceedings against a person allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, under Article\u00a022 of Directive 95/46, Member States are required to provide for the right of every person to a judicial remedy for any breach of the rights guaranteed him by the national law applicable to the processing in question.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third indent of Article\u00a028(3) of Directive 95/46 states that a supervisory authority that is responsible under Article\u00a028(1) of that directive for monitoring the application within the territory of a Member State of the provisions adopted by that Member State pursuant to that directive is endowed with, inter alia, the power to engage in legal proceedings where the national provisions adopted pursuant to that directive have been violated or to bring those violations to the attention of the judicial authorities.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a028(4) of Directive 95/46 provides that a supervisory authority is to hear claims lodged by an association representing a data subject, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of that directive, concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal data.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, no provision of that directive obliges Member States to provide, or expressly empowers them to provide, in their national law that an association can represent a data subject in legal proceedings or commence legal proceedings on its own initiative against the person allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, it does not follow from the above that Directive 95/46 precludes national legislation allowing consumer-protection associations to bring or defend legal proceedings against the person allegedly responsible for such an infringement.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the third paragraph of Article\u00a0288 TFEU, the Member States are required, when transposing a directive, to ensure that it is fully effective, but they retain a broad discretion as to the choice of ways and means of ensuring that it is implemented. That freedom of choice does not affect the obligation imposed on all Member States to which the directive is addressed to adopt all the measures necessary to ensure that the directive concerned is fully effective in accordance with the objective which it seeks to attain (judgments of 6\u00a0October 2010, \nBase and Others\n, C-389/08, EU:C:2010:584, paragraphs\u00a024 and 25, and of 22\u00a0February 2018, \nPorras Guisado\n, C-103/16, EU:C:2018:99, paragraph\u00a057).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, it must be noted that one of the underlying objectives of Directive 95/46 is to ensure effective and complete protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data (see, to that effect, judgments of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a053, and of 27\u00a0September 2017, \nPu\u0161k\u00e1r\n, C-73/16, EU:C:2017:725, paragraph\u00a038). Recital\u00a010 of Directive 95/46 adds that the approximation of the national laws applicable in this area must not result in any lessening of the protection which they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the European Union (judgments of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a095, of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nHuber\n, C-524/06, EU:C:2008:724, paragraph\u00a050, and of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nAsociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Establecimientos Financieros de Cr\u00e9dito\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraph\u00a028).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that a Member State provides in its national legislation that it is possible for a consumer-protection association to commence legal proceedings against a person who is allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data in no way undermines the objectives of that protection and, in fact, contributes to the realisation of those objectives.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, Fashion\u00a0ID and Facebook Ireland submit that, since Directive 95/46 fully harmonised national provisions on data protection, any legal proceedings not expressly provided for by that directive are precluded. They argue that Articles\u00a022, 23 and 28 of Directive 95/46 provide for legal proceedings brought only by data subjects and data protection supervisory authorities.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That argument, however, cannot be accepted.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 95/46 does indeed amount to a harmonisation of national legislation on the protection of personal data that is generally complete (see, to that effect, judgments of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nAsociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Establecimientos Financieros de Cr\u00e9dito\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraph\u00a029, and of 7\u00a0November 2013, \nIPI\n, C-473/12, EU:C:2013:715, paragraph\u00a031).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has thus held that Article\u00a07 of that directive sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of cases in which the processing of personal data can be regarded as being lawful and that Member States cannot add new principles relating to the lawfulness of the processing of personal data to that article or impose additional requirements that have the effect of amending the scope of one of the six principles provided for in that article (judgments of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nAsociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Establecimientos Financieros de Cr\u00e9dito\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraphs\u00a030 and 32, and of 19\u00a0October 2016, \nBreyer\n, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph\u00a057).\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has, however, also held that Directive 95/46 lays down rules that are relatively general since it has to be applied to a large number of very different situations. Those rules have a degree of flexibility and, in many instances, leave to the Member States the task of deciding the details or choosing between options, meaning that, in many respects, Member States have a margin of discretion in implementing that directive (see, to that effect, judgments of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraphs\u00a083, 84 and 97, and of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nAsociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Establecimientos Financieros de Cr\u00e9dito\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraph\u00a035).\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is also the case for Articles\u00a022 to 24 of Directive 95/46, which, as the Advocate General noted in point\u00a042 of his Opinion, are worded in general terms and do not amount to an exhaustive harmonisation of the national provisions stipulating the judicial remedies that can be brought against a person allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data (see, by analogy, judgment of 26\u00a0October 2017, \nI\n, C-195/16, EU:C:2017:815, paragraphs\u00a057 and 58).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, although Article\u00a022 of that directive requires Member States to provide for the right of every person to a judicial remedy for any breach of the rights guaranteed him by the national law applicable to the personal data processing in question, that directive does not, however, contain any provisions specifically governing the conditions under which that remedy may be exercised (see, to that effect, judgment of 27\u00a0September 2017, \nPu\u0161k\u00e1r\n, C-73/16, EU:C:2017:725, paragraphs\u00a054 and 55).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Article\u00a024 of Directive 95/46 provides that Member States are to adopt \u2018suitable measures\u2019 to ensure the full implementation of the provisions of that directive, without defining such measures. It seems that a provision making it possible for a consumer-protection association to commence legal proceedings against a person who is allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data may constitute a suitable measure, within the meaning of that provision, that contributes, as observed in paragraph\u00a051 above, to the realisation of the objectives of that directive, in accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a097).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, contrary to what is claimed by Fashion\u00a0ID, the fact that a Member State can provide for such a possibility in its national legislation does not appear to be such as to undermine the independence with which the supervisory authorities must perform the functions entrusted to them under Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, since that possibility affects neither those authorities\u2019 freedom to take decisions nor their freedom to act.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, although it is true that Directive 95/46 does not appear among the measures listed in Annex\u00a0I to Directive 2009/22, the fact nonetheless remains that, under Article\u00a07 of the latter directive, that directive did not provide for an exhaustive harmonisation in that respect.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last, the fact that Regulation 2016/679, which repealed and replaced Directive 95/46 and has been applicable since 25\u00a0May 2018, expressly authorises, in Article\u00a080(2) thereof, Member States to allow consumer-protection associations to bring or defend legal proceedings against a person who is allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data does not mean that Member States could not grant them that right under Directive 95/46, but confirms, rather, that the interpretation of that directive in the present judgment reflects the will of the EU legislature.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the findings above, the answer to the first question is that Articles\u00a022 to 24 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which allows consumer-protection associations to bring or defend legal proceedings against a person allegedly responsible for an infringement of the protection of personal data.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the operator of a website, such as Fashion\u00a0ID, that embeds on that website a social plugin causing the browser of a visitor to that website to request content from the provider of that plugin and, to that end, to transmit to that provider the personal data of the visitor can be considered to be a controller, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46, despite that operator being unable to influence the processing of the data transmitted to that provider as a result.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, it should be noted that, in accordance with the aim pursued by Directive 95/46, namely to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data, Article\u00a02(d) of that directive defines the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 broadly as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraphs\u00a026 and 27).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has held previously, the objective of that provision is to ensure, through a broad definition of the concept of \u2018controller\u2019, effective and complete protection of data subjects (judgments of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a034, and of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraph\u00a028).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, since, as Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 expressly provides, the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 relates to the entity which \u2018alone or jointly with others\u2019 determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, that concept does not necessarily refer to a single entity and may concern several actors taking part in that processing, with each of them then being subject to the applicable data-protection provisions (see, to that effect, judgments of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraph\u00a029, and of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a065).\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has also held that a natural or legal person who exerts influence over the processing of personal data, for his own purposes, and who participates, as a result, in the determination of the purposes and means of that processing, may be regarded as a controller within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 (judgment of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a068).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the joint responsibility of several actors for the same processing, under that provision, does not require each of them to have access to the personal data concerned (see, to that effect, judgments of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraph\u00a038, and of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a069).\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, since the objective of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 is to ensure, through a broad definition of the concept of \u2018controller\u2019, the effective and comprehensive protection of the persons concerned, the existence of joint liability does not necessarily imply equal responsibility of the various operators engaged in the processing of personal data. On the contrary, those operators may be involved at different stages of that processing of personal data and to different degrees, with the result that the level of liability of each of them must be assessed with regard to all the relevant circumstances of the particular case (see, to that effect, judgment of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a066).\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, it should be pointed out, first, that Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 defines \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 as \u2018any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction\u2019.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from that definition that the processing of personal data may consist in one or a number of operations, each of which relates to one of the different stages that the processing of personal data may involve.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, it follows from the definition of the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 in Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 that, as is noted in paragraph\u00a065 above, where several operators determine jointly the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, they participate in that processing as controllers.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, as the Advocate General noted, in essence, in point\u00a0101 of his Opinion, it appears that a natural or legal person may be a controller, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46, jointly with others only in respect of operations involving the processing of personal data for which it determines jointly the purposes and means. By contrast, and without prejudice to any civil liability provided for in national law in this respect, that natural or legal person cannot be considered to be a controller, within the meaning of that provision, in the context of operations that precede or are subsequent in the overall chain of processing for which that person does not determine either the purposes or the means.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, subject to the investigations that it is for the referring court to carry out, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that, by embedding on its website the Facebook \u2018Like\u2019 button, Fashion\u00a0ID appears to have made it possible for Facebook Ireland to obtain personal data of visitors to its website and that such a possibility is triggered as soon as the visitor consults that website, regardless of whether or not the visitor is a member of the social network Facebook, has clicked on the Facebook \u2018Like\u2019 button or is aware of such an operation.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of that information, it should be pointed out that the operations involving the processing of personal data in respect of which Fashion\u00a0ID is capable of determining, jointly with Facebook Ireland, the purposes and means are, for the purposes of the definition of the concept of \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 in Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46, the collection and disclosure by transmission of the personal data of visitors to its website. By contrast, in the light of that information, it seems, at the outset, impossible that Fashion\u00a0ID determines the purposes and means of subsequent operations involving the processing of personal data carried out by Facebook Ireland after their transmission to the latter, meaning that Fashion\u00a0ID cannot be considered to be a controller in respect of those operations within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d).\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the means used for the purposes of the collection and disclosure by transmission of certain personal data of visitors to its website, it is apparent from paragraph\u00a075 above that Fashion\u00a0ID appears to have embedded on its website the Facebook \u2018Like\u2019 button made available to website operators by Facebook Ireland while fully aware of the fact that it serves as a tool for the collection and disclosure by transmission of the personal data of visitors to that website, regardless of whether or not the visitors are members of the social network Facebook.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, by embedding that social plugin on its website, Fashion\u00a0ID exerts a decisive influence over the collection and transmission of the personal data of visitors to that website to the provider of that plugin, Facebook Ireland, which would not have occurred without that plugin.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In these circumstances, and subject to the investigations that it is for the referring court to carry out in this respect, it must be concluded that Facebook Ireland and Fashion\u00a0ID determine jointly the means at the origin of the operations involving the collection and disclosure by transmission of the personal data of visitors to Fashion\u00a0ID\u2019s website.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the purposes of those operations involving the processing of personal data, it appears that Fashion\u00a0ID\u2019s embedding of the Facebook \u2018Like\u2019 button on its website allows it to optimise the publicity of its goods by making them more visible on the social network Facebook when a visitor to its website clicks on that button. The reason why Fashion\u00a0ID seems to have consented, at least implicitly, to the collection and disclosure by transmission of the personal data of visitors to its website by embedding such a plugin on that website is in order to benefit from the commercial advantage consisting in increased publicity for its goods; those processing operations are performed in the economic interests of both Fashion\u00a0ID and Facebook Ireland, for whom the fact that it can use those data for its own commercial purposes is the consideration for the benefit to Fashion\u00a0ID.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In such circumstances, it can be concluded, subject to the investigations that it is for the referring court to perform, that Fashion\u00a0ID and Facebook Ireland determine jointly the purposes of the operations involving the collection and disclosure by transmission of the personal data at issue in the main proceedings.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, as is apparent from the case-law referred to in paragraph\u00a069 above, the fact that the operator of a website, such as Fashion\u00a0ID, does not itself have access to the personal data collected and transmitted to the provider of the social plugin with which it determines jointly the means and purposes of the processing of personal data does not preclude it from being a controller within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it must be emphasised that a website, such as that of Fashion\u00a0ID, is visited both by those who are members of the social network Facebook, and who therefore have an account on that social network, and by those who do not have one. In that latter case, the responsibility of the operator of a website, such as Fashion\u00a0ID, for the processing of the personal data of those persons appears to be even greater, as the mere consultation of such a website featuring the Facebook \u2018Like\u2019 button appears to trigger the processing of their personal data by Facebook Ireland (see, to that effect. judgment of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraph\u00a041).\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it seems that Fashion\u00a0ID can be considered to be a controller within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46, jointly with Facebook Ireland, in respect of the operations involving the collection and disclosure by transmission of the personal data of visitors to its website.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the findings above, the answer to the second question is that the operator of a website, such as Fashion\u00a0ID, that embeds on that website a social plugin causing the browser of a visitor to that website to request content from the provider of that plugin and, to that end, to transmit to that provider the personal data of the visitor can be considered to be a controller, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46. That liability is, however, limited to the operation or set of operations involving the processing of personal data in respect of which it actually determines the purposes and means, that is to say, the collection and disclosure by transmission of the data at issue.\n\u00a0\nThe third question\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the answer given to the second question, there is no need to answer the third question.\n\u00a0\nThe fourth question\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which the operator of a website embeds on that website a social plugin causing the browser of a visitor to that website to request content from the provider of that plugin and, to that end, to transmit to that provider personal data of the visitor, it is appropriate, for the purposes of the application of Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, to take into consideration a legitimate interest pursued by that operator or a legitimate interest pursued by that provider.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, according to the Commission, this question is irrelevant for the resolution of the dispute in the main proceedings, since consent was not obtained from the data subjects as is required by Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be pointed out that Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58 provides that Member States are to ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is allowed only on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information, in accordance with Directive 95/46, inter alia, about the purposes of the processing.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for the referring court to investigate whether, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the provider of a social plugin, such as Facebook Ireland, gains access, as is maintained by the Commission, from the operator of the website to information stored in the terminal equipment, within the meaning of Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58, of a visitor to that website.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In such circumstances, and since the referring court seems to have concluded that, in the present case, the data transmitted to Facebook Ireland are personal data, within the meaning of Directive 95/46, which, moreover, are not necessarily limited to information stored in the terminal equipment, which it is for that court to confirm, the Commission\u2019s views are insufficient to call into question the relevance of the fourth question referred for the resolution of the dispute in the main proceedings, which concerns the potentially lawful processing of the data at issue in the main proceedings, as was pointed out by the Advocate General in point\u00a0115 of his Opinion.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, it is necessary to examine what legitimate interest must be taken into account for the purposes of the application of Article\u00a07(f) of that directive to the processing of those data.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, it should be noted at the outset that, according to the provisions of Chapter II of Directive 95/46, headed \u2018General rules on the lawfulness of the processing of personal data\u2019, subject to the derogations permitted under Article\u00a013 of that directive, all processing of personal data must comply, inter alia, with one of the criteria for making data processing legitimate listed in Article\u00a07 of that directive (see, to that effect, judgments of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a071, and of 1\u00a0October 2015, \nBara and Others\n, C-201/14, EU:C:2015:638, paragraph\u00a030).\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, the interpretation of which is sought by the referring court, personal data may be processed if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection under Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 95/46.\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a07(f) of that directive thus lays down three cumulative conditions for the processing of personal data to be lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed; second, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and third, the condition that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject whose data require protection do not take precedence (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2017, \nR\u012bgas satiksme\n, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph\u00a028).\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given that, in the light of the answer to the second question, it seems that, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the operator of a website that embeds on that website a social plugin causing the browser of a visitor to that website to request content from the provider of that plugin and, to that end, to transmit to that provider the personal data of the visitor can be considered to be a controller responsible, jointly with that provider, for operations involving the processing of the personal data of visitors to its website in the form of collection and disclosure by transmission, it is necessary that each of those controllers should pursue a legitimate interest, within the meaning of Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, through those processing operations in order for those operations to be justified in respect of each of them.\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the findings above, the answer to the fourth question is that, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which the operator of a website embeds on that website a social plugin causing the browser of a visitor to that website to request content from the provider of that plugin and, to that end, to transmit to that provider personal data of the visitor, it is necessary that that operator and that provider each pursue a legitimate interest, within the meaning of Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, through those processing operations in order for those operations to be justified in respect of each of them.\n\u00a0\nThe fifth and sixth questions\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fifth and sixth questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court wishes to know, in essence, first, whether Article\u00a02(h) and Article\u00a07(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which the operator of a website embeds on that website a social plugin causing the browser of a visitor to that website to request content from the provider of that plugin and, to that end, to transmit to that provider personal data of the visitor, the consent referred to in those provisions must be obtained by that operator or by that provider and, second, whether Article\u00a010 of that directive must be interpreted as meaning that, in such a situation, the duty to inform provided for in that provision is incumbent on that operator.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from the answer to the second question, the operator of a website that embeds on that website a social plugin causing the browser of a visitor to that website to request content from the provider of that plugin and, to that end, to transmit to that provider personal data of the visitor can be considered to be a controller, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46, despite that liability being limited to the operation or set of operations involving the processing of personal data in respect of which it actually determines the purposes and means.\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It thus appears that the duties that may be incumbent on that controller under Directive 95/46, such as the duty to obtain the consent of the data subject under Article\u00a02(h) and Article\u00a07(a) of that directive and the duty to inform under Article\u00a010 thereof, must relate to the operation or set of operations involving the processing of personal data in respect of which it actually determines the purposes and means.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, while the operator of a website that embeds on that website a social plugin causing the browser of a visitor to that website to request content from the provider of that plugin and, to that end, to transmit to that provider the personal data of the visitor can be considered to be a controller, jointly with that provider, in respect of operations involving the collection and disclosure by transmission of the personal data of that visitor, its duty to obtain the consent from the data subject under Article\u00a02(h) and Article\u00a07(a) of Directive 95/46 and its duty to inform under Article\u00a010 of that directive relate only to those operations. By contrast, those duties do not cover operations involving the processing of personal data at other stages occurring before or after those operations which involve, as the case may be, the processing of personal data at issue.\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the consent referred to in Article\u00a02(h) and Article\u00a07(a) of Directive 95/46, it appears that such consent must be given prior to the collection and disclosure by transmission of the data subject\u2019s data. In such circumstances, it is for the operator of the website, rather than for the provider of the social plugin, to obtain that consent, since it is the fact that the visitor consults that website that triggers the processing of the personal data. As the Advocate General noted in point\u00a0132 of his Opinion, it would not be in line with efficient and timely protection of the data subject\u2019s rights if the consent were given only to the joint controller that is involved later, namely the provider of that plugin. However, the consent that must be given to the operator relates only to the operation or set of operations involving the processing of personal data in respect of which the operator actually determines the purposes and means.\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same applies in regard to the duty to inform under Article\u00a010 of Directive 95/46.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it follows from the wording of that provision that the controller or his representative must provide, as a minimum, the information referred to in that provision to the subject whose data are being collected. It thus appears that that information must be given by the controller immediately, that is to say, when the data are collected (see, to that effect, judgments of 7\u00a0May 2009, \nRijkeboer\n, C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293, paragraph\u00a068, and of 7\u00a0November 2013, \nIPI\n, C-473/12, EU:C:2013:715, paragraph\u00a023).\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the duty to inform under Article\u00a010 of Directive 95/46 is incumbent also on the operator of the website, but the information that the latter must provide to the data subject need relate only to the operation or set of operations involving the processing of personal data in respect of which that operator actually determines the purposes and means.\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the findings above, the answer to the fifth and sixth questions is that Article\u00a02(h) and Article\u00a07(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which the operator of a website embeds on that website a social plugin causing the browser of a visitor to that website to request content from the provider of that plugin and, to that end, to transmit to that provider personal data of the visitor, the consent referred to in those provisions must be obtained by that operator only with regard to the operation or set of operations involving the processing of personal data in respect of which that operator determines the purposes and means. In addition, Article\u00a010 of that directive must be interpreted as meaning that, in such a situation, the duty to inform laid down in that provision is incumbent also on that operator, but the information that the latter must provide to the data subject need relate only to the operation or set of operations involving the processing of personal data in respect of which that operator actually determines the purposes and means.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticles\u00a022 to 24 of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which allows consumer-protection associations to bring or defend legal proceedings against a person allegedly responsible for an infringement of the protection of personal data.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe operator of a website, such as Fashion\u00a0ID GmbH & Co. KG, that embeds on that website a social plugin causing the browser of a visitor to that website to request content from the provider of that plugin and, to that end, to transmit to that provider personal data of the visitor can be considered to be a controller, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46. That liability is, however, limited to the operation or set of operations involving the processing of personal data in respect of which it actually determines the purposes and means, that is to say, the collection and disclosure by transmission of the data at issue.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which the operator of a website embeds on that website a social plugin causing the browser of a visitor to that website to request content from the provider of that plugin and, to that end, to transmit to that provider personal data of the visitor, it is necessary that that operator and that provider each pursue a legitimate interest, within the meaning of Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, through those processing operations in order for those operations to be justified in respect of each of them.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(h) and Article\u00a07(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which the operator of a website embeds on that website a social plugin causing the browser of a visitor to that website to request content from the provider of that plugin and, to that end, to transmit to that provider personal data of the visitor, the consent referred to in those provisions must be obtained by that operator only with regard to the operation or set of operations involving the processing of personal data in respect of which that operator determines the purposes and means. In addition, Article\u00a010 of that directive must be interpreted as meaning that, in such a situation, the duty to inform laid down in that provision is incumbent also on that operator, but the information that the latter must provide to the data subject need relate only to the operation or set of operations involving the processing of personal data in respect of which that operator actually determines the purposes and means."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes.\n\u2026\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags.

The members of IAB Europe are undertakings in that sector, such as publishers, e-commerce and marketing undertakings and intermediaries, as well as national associations, including national IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) branches, which, in turn, have undertakings in that sector as members. The members of IAB Europe include, inter alia, undertakings which generate significant income through the sale of advertising space on websites or applications.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IAB Europe has drawn up the Transparency & Consent Framework (\u2018the TCF\u2019), which is a framework of rules consisting of guidelines, instructions, technical specifications, protocols and contractual obligations that enable both the provider of a website or application and data brokers or indeed advertising platforms to process lawfully the personal data of a user of a website or application.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The TCF is aimed, inter alia, at promoting compliance with the GDPR when those operators use the OpenRTB protocol, one of the most widely used protocols for Real Time Bidding, which is an instant and automated online auction system of user profiles for the purpose of selling and purchasing advertising space on the internet (\u2018RTB\u2019). In the light of certain practices implemented by members of IAB Europe in the context of that mass personal data exchange system relating to user profiles, the TCF was presented by IAB Europe as a solution capable of bringing that auction system into conformity with the GDPR.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, as is apparent from the file submitted to the Court, from a technical point of view, when a user consults a website or application containing advertising space, advertising technology companies\u00a0\u2013 particularly data brokers and advertising platforms, which represent thousands of advertisers\u00a0\u2013 can bid in real time, behind the scenes, to acquire that advertising space by means of an automated auction system using algorithms, in order to display in that space targeted advertisements specifically tailored to the profile of such a user.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, before displaying such targeted advertisements, the prior consent of that user must be obtained. Thus, when he or she consults a website or application for the first time, a Consent Management Platform (\u2018CMP\u2019) appears in a pop-up window enabling that user, first, to give his or her consent to the provider of the website or application for the collection and processing of his or her personal data for pre-defined purposes, such as, inter alia, marketing or advertising, or with a view to sharing those data with certain providers, and, second, to object to various types of data processing or to the sharing of those data, based on legitimate interests claimed by providers, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(f) of the GDPR. Those personal data relate, inter alia, to the user\u2019s location, age and search and recent purchase history.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the TCF provides a framework for large-scale processing of personal data and facilitates the recording of users\u2019 preferences by means of the CMP. Those preferences are subsequently encoded and stored in a string composed of a combination of letters and characters referred to by IAB Europe as the Transparency and Consent String (\u2018the TC String\u2019), which is shared with personal data brokers and advertising platforms participating in the OpenRTB protocol, so that they know to what the user has consented or objected. The CMP also places a cookie (euconsent-v2) on the user\u2019s device. When they are combined, the TC String and the euconsent-v2 cookie can be linked to that user\u2019s IP address.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The TCF thus plays a role in the operation of the OpenRTB protocol, since it makes it possible to transcribe the user\u2019s preferences with a view to communicating them to potential sellers and achieving various processing objectives, including the offering of tailored advertising. The TCF aims, inter alia, to guarantee to personal data brokers and advertising platforms, by means of the TC String, compliance with the GDPR.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since 2019, the DPA has received a number of complaints against IAB Europe, originating both from Belgium and from third countries, concerning the compliance of the TCF with the GDPR. After having examined those complaints, the DPA, in its capacity as lead supervisory authority within the meaning of Article\u00a056(1) of the GDPR, triggered the cooperation and consistency mechanism, in accordance with Articles\u00a060 to 63 of that regulation, in order to reach a common decision approved jointly by all 21 national supervisory authorities involved in that mechanism. Thus, by its decision of 2\u00a0February 2022 (\u2018the decision of 2\u00a0February 2022\u2019), the Litigation Chamber of the DPA held that IAB Europe was acting as personal data controller as regards the recording of the consent signal, objections and preferences of individual users by means of a TC String, which, according to the Litigation Chamber of the DPA, is associated with an identifiable user. In addition, in that decision, the Litigation Chamber of the DPA ordered IAB Europe, in accordance with point\u00a09\u00b0 of Article\u00a0100(1) of the LDPA, to bring into conformity with the provisions of the GDPR the processing of personal data carried out in the context of the TCF and imposed on it a number of corrective measures as well as an administrative fine.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IAB Europe brought an action against that decision before the referring court, the hof van beroep te Brussel (Court of Appeal, Brussels, Belgium). IAB Europe requests that court to annul the decision of 2\u00a0February 2022. It challenges, inter alia, the fact that it was considered to have acted as controller. It also submits that, in so far as the decision finds that the TC String is personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR, that decision is insufficiently qualified and reasoned and that, in any event, it is incorrect. In particular, IAB Europe argues that only the other participants in the TCF could combine the TC String with an IP address to convert it into an item of personal data, that the TC String is not specific to a user and that IAB Europe does not have the possibility to access the data processed in that context by its members.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The DPA, supported in the national proceedings by Mr\u00a0Jef Ausloos, Mr\u00a0Pierre Dewitte, Mr\u00a0Johnny Ryan, Fundacja Panoptykon, Stichting Bits of Freedom and Ligue des Droits Humains VZW, contends, inter alia, that TC Strings do constitute personal data, in so far as CMPs can link TC Strings to IP addresses, that, moreover, participants in the TCF can also identify users on the basis of other data, that IAB Europe has access to the information needed to do that, and that such identification of the user is precisely the purpose of the TC String, which is intended to facilitate the sale of targeted advertising. In addition, the DPA maintains, inter alia, that the fact that IAB Europe must be regarded as a controller within the meaning of the GDPR is apparent from its decisive role in the processing of TC Strings. The DPA adds that IAB Europe determines, respectively, the purposes and means of the processing, how TC Strings are generated, modified and read, how and where the necessary cookies are stored, who receives the personal data and on the basis of which criteria the storage periods for TC Strings may be established.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court has doubts as to whether a TC String, be it combined with an IP address or not, constitutes personal data and, if so, whether IAB Europe must be classified as a personal data controller in the context of the TCF, in particular with regard to the processing of the TC String. In that respect, the referring court states that, while it is true that the decision of 2\u00a0February 2022 reflects the common position adopted jointly by the various national supervisory authorities involved in the present case, the Court of Justice has not yet had the opportunity to rule on that new and far-reaching technology which the TC String represents.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the hof van beroep te Brussel (Court of Appeal, Brussels) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article\u00a04(1) of [the GDPR], read in combination with Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the [Charter], be interpreted as meaning that a character string that captures the preferences of an [internet] user in connection with the processing of his or her personal data in a structured and machine-readable manner constitutes personal data within the meaning of [that] provision in respect of [(i)] a sectoral organisation which makes available to its members a standard whereby it prescribes to them how that string should be generated, stored and/or distributed practically and technically, and [(ii)] the parties that have implemented that standard on their websites or in their apps and thus have access to that string?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does it make a difference in that regard if the implementation of the standard means that [that] string is available together with an IP address?\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the answer to questions 1(a) and 1(b) lead to a different conclusion if [that] standard-setting sectoral organisation does not itself have legal access to the personal data that are processed within [that] standard by its members?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must [Article]\u00a04(7) and [Article]\u00a024(1) of [the GDPR], read in combination with Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the [Charter], be interpreted as meaning that a standard-setting sectoral organisation must be classified as a controller if it offers its members a standard for managing consent which contains, in addition to a binding technical framework, rules setting out in detail how those consent data\u00a0\u2013 which constitute personal data\u00a0\u2013 must be stored and disseminated?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the answer to question 2(a) lead to a different conclusion if [that] sectoral organisation\u00a0\u2026 does not itself have legal access to the personal data that are processed within [that] standard by its members?\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the standard-setting sectoral organisation must be designated as a controller or a joint controller for the processing of [internet] users\u2019 preferences, does that (joint) responsibility of the standard-setting sectoral organisation therefore automatically extend to the subsequent processing by third parties for which the [internet] users\u2019 preferences were obtained, such as targeted online advertising by publishers and vendors?\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that a string composed of a combination of letters and characters, such as the TC String, containing the preferences of a user of the internet or of an application relating to that user\u2019s consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her by website or application providers as well as by brokers of such data and by advertising platforms, constitutes personal data within the meaning of that provision, where a sectoral organisation has established the framework of rules under which that string must be generated, stored or disseminated and the members of such an organisation have implemented such rules and thus have access to that string. That court also wishes to ascertain whether, for the purpose of answering that question, it is important, in the first place, for that string to be associated with an identifier, such as, inter alia, the IP address of that user\u2019s device, allowing the data subject to be identified, and, in the second place, for such a sectoral organisation to have the right to access directly the personal data which are processed by its members under the framework of rules that it has established.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be recalled that, since the GDPR repealed and replaced Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L\u00a0281, p.\u00a031) and the relevant provisions of that regulation have essentially the same scope as that of the relevant provisions of that directive, the Court\u2019s case-law on that directive is also applicable, in principle, to that regulation (judgment of 17\u00a0June 2021, \nM.I.C.M.\n, C-597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraph\u00a0107).\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, the interpretation of a provision of EU law requires that account be taken not only of its wording, but also of its context and the objectives and purpose pursued by the act of which it forms part (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2023, \nPankki S\n, C-579/21, EU:C:2023:501, paragraph\u00a038 and the case-law cited).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR states that personal data is \u2018any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019, and specifies that \u2018an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person\u2019.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use of the expression \u2018any information\u2019 in the definition of the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 in that provision reflects the aim of the EU legislature to assign a wide scope to that concept, which potentially encompasses all kinds of information, not only objective but also subjective, in the form of opinions and assessments, provided that it \u2018relates to\u2019 the data subject (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a023 and the case-law cited).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court has held that information relates to an identified or identifiable natural person where, by reason of its content, purpose or effect, it is linked to an identifiable person (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a024 and the case-law cited).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the \u2018identifiable\u2019 nature of a person, it is clear from the wording of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR that an identifiable person is one who can be identified not only directly, but also indirectly.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has already held, the use by the EU legislature of the word \u2018indirectly\u2019 suggests that, in order to treat information as personal data, it is not necessary that that information alone allows the data subject to be identified (see, by analogy, judgment of 19\u00a0October 2016, \nBreyer\n, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph\u00a041). On the contrary, it follows from Article\u00a04(5) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with recital\u00a026 of that regulation, that personal data which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information must be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person (judgment of 5\u00a0December 2023, \nNacionalinis visuomen\u0117s sveikatos centras\n, C-683/21, EU:C:2023:949, paragraph\u00a058).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, that recital\u00a026 states that, in order to determine whether a person is \u2018identifiable\u2019, account should be taken of \u2018all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly\u2019. That wording suggests that, for information to be treated as \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of that regulation, it is not required that all the information enabling the identification of the data subject must be in the hands of one person (see, by analogy, judgment of 19\u00a0October 2016, \nBreyer\n, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph\u00a043).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 covers not only data collected and stored by the controller, but also includes all information resulting from the processing of personal data relating to an identified or identifiable person (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2023, \nPankki S\n, C-579/21, EU:C:2023:501, paragraph\u00a045).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it should be noted that a string composed of a combination of letters and characters, such as the TC String, contains the preferences of a user of the internet or of an application relating to that user\u2019s consent to the processing by third parties of personal data concerning him or her or relating to any objection by him or her to the processing of such data based on an alleged legitimate interest under Article\u00a06(1)(f) of the GDPR.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if a TC String did not itself contain factors allowing the data subject to be identified directly, it would still be the case, in the first place, that it contained the individual preferences of a specific user regarding his or her consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her, that information \u2018relating to [a]\u00a0\u2026 natural person\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it is also common ground that, where the information contained in a TC String is associated with an identifier, such as, inter alia, the IP address of the device of such a user, that information may make it possible to create a profile of that user and actually identify the person specifically concerned by such information.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as associating a string composed of a combination of letters and characters, such as the TC String, with additional data, inter alia with the IP address of a user\u2019s device or with other identifiers, allows that user to be identified, it must be considered that the TC String contains information concerning an identifiable user and therefore constitutes personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR, a conclusion which is supported by recital\u00a030 of the GDPR, which expressly refers to such a case.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation cannot be called into question by the mere fact that IAB Europe cannot itself combine the TC String with the IP address of a user\u2019s device and does not have the possibility of directly accessing the data processed by its members in the context of the TCF.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from the case-law referred to in paragraph\u00a040 above, such a fact does not preclude a TC String from being classified as \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it is apparent from the documents before the Court, and in particular from the decision of 2\u00a0February 2022, that the members of IAB Europe are required to provide that organisation, at its request, with all the information allowing it to identify the users whose data are the subject of a TC String.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It therefore appears, subject to the verifications which are for the referring court to carry out in that regard, that IAB Europe has, in accordance with what is stated in recital\u00a026 of the GDPR, reasonable means allowing it to identify a particular natural person from a TC String, on the basis of the information which its members and other organisations participating in the TCF are required to provide to it.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that a TC String constitutes personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR. It is irrelevant in that regard that, without an external contribution which it is entitled to require, such a sectoral organisation can neither access the data that are processed by its members under the rules which it has established nor combine the TC String with other identifiers, such as, inter alia, the IP address of a user\u2019s device.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that a string composed of a combination of letters and characters, such as the TC String, containing the preferences of a user of the internet or of an application relating to that user\u2019s consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her by website or application providers as well as by brokers of such data and by advertising platforms constitutes personal data within the meaning of that provision in so far as, where those data may, by reasonable means, be associated with an identifier, such as, inter alia, the IP address of that user\u2019s device, they allow the data subject to be identified. In such circumstances, the fact that, without an external contribution, a sectoral organisation holding that string can neither access the data that are processed by its members under the rules which that organisation has established nor combine that string with other factors does not preclude that string from constituting personal data within the meaning of that provision.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0first, a sectoral organisation, in so far as it proposes to its members a framework of rules that it has established relating to consent to the processing of personal data, which contains not only binding technical rules but also rules setting out in detail the arrangements for storing and disseminating personal data relating to such consent, must be classified as a \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of that provision, and whether, for the answer to that question, it is relevant that such a sectoral organisation itself have direct access to the personal data processed by its members under those rules;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0second, any joint controllership of that sectoral organisation extends automatically to the subsequent processing of personal data carried out by third parties, such as website or application providers, with regard to users\u2019 preferences for the purposes of targeted online advertising.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be borne in mind that the objective pursued by the GDPR, as is set out in Article\u00a01 thereof and in recitals\u00a01 and 10 thereof, consists, inter alia, in ensuring a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data, as enshrined in Article\u00a08(1) of the Charter and Article\u00a016(1) TFEU (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \nBundesrepublik Deutschland (Court electronic mailbox)\n,\n C-60/22, EU:C:2023:373, paragraph\u00a064).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with that objective, Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR defines broadly the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 as referring to the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has previously held, the objective of that provision is to ensure, through that broad definition of the concept of \u2018controller\u2019, effective and complete protection of data subjects (see, by analogy, judgment of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraph\u00a028).\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, since, as Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR expressly provides, the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 relates to the entity which \u2018alone or jointly with others\u2019 determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, that concept does not necessarily refer to a single entity and may concern several actors taking part in that processing, with each of them then being subject to the applicable data protection provisions (see, by analogy, judgments of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraph\u00a029, and of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a065).\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has also found that a natural or legal person who exerts influence over the processing of personal data, for his, her or its own purposes, and who participates, as a result, in the determination of the purposes and means of that processing, may be regarded as a controller within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR (see, by analogy, judgment of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a068). Thus, under Article\u00a026(1) of the GDPR, \u2018joint controllers\u2019 exist where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing (judgment of 5\u00a0December 2023, \nNacionalinis visuomen\u0117s sveikatos centras\n, C-683/21, EU:C:2023:949, paragraph\u00a040).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, although each joint controller must independently meet the definition of \u2018controller\u2019 which is set out in Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR, the existence of joint controllership does not necessarily imply equal responsibility of the various operators engaged in the processing of personal data. On the contrary, those operators may be involved at different stages of that processing of personal data and to different degrees, so that the level of responsibility of each of them must be assessed in the light of all the relevant circumstances of the particular case. In addition, the joint controllership of several actors for the same processing, under that provision, does not require each of them to have access to the personal data concerned (see, by analogy, judgment of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraphs\u00a066 and 69 and the case-law cited).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Participation in the determination of the purposes and means of processing can take different forms, since such participation can result from a common decision taken by two or more entities or from converging decisions of those entities. Where the latter is the case, those decisions must complement each other in such a manner that they each have a tangible impact on the determination of the purposes and means of the processing. By contrast, it cannot be required that there be a formal arrangement between those controllers as regards the purposes and means of processing (judgment of 5\u00a0December 2023, \nNacionalinis visuomen\u0117s sveikatos centras\n, C-683/21, EU:C:2023:949, paragraphs\u00a043 and 44).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the first part of the second question referred must be regarded as seeking to ascertain whether a sectoral organisation, such as IAB Europe, may be regarded as a joint controller for the purposes of Article\u00a04(7) and Article\u00a026(1) of the GDPR.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, it is therefore necessary to assess whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case at issue, IAB Europe exerts influence over the processing of personal data, such as the TC String, for its own purposes, and determines, jointly with others, the purposes and means of such processing.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the first place, the purposes of such processing of personal data, subject to the verifications which are for the referring court to carry out, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that, as has been noted in paragraphs\u00a021 and 22 above, the TCF established by IAB Europe constitutes a framework of rules intended to ensure that the processing of personal data of a user of a website or application carried out by certain operators which participate in the online auctioning of advertising space is in compliance with the GDPR.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the TCF aims, in essence, to promote and enable the sale and purchase of advertising space on the internet by such operators.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the view may be taken, subject to the verifications which are for the referring court to carry out, that IAB Europe exerts influence over the personal data processing operations at issue in the main proceedings, for its own purposes, and determines, as a result, jointly with its members, the purposes of such operations.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards the means employed for the purposes of such processing of personal data, it is apparent from the documents before the Court, subject to the verifications which are for the referring court to carry out, that the TCF constitutes a framework of rules which the members of IAB Europe are supposed to accept in order to join that association. In particular, as was confirmed by IAB Europe at the hearing before the Court, if one of its members does not comply with the rules of the TCF, IAB Europe may adopt a non-compliance and suspension decision in respect of that member, which may result in the exclusion of that member from the TCF and, consequently, prevent it from relying on the guarantee of GDPR compliance that that system is supposed to provide with regard to the processing of personal data which that member carries out using TC Strings.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, and from a practical point of view, as has been stated in paragraph\u00a021 above, the TCF established by IAB Europe contains technical specifications relating to the processing of the TC String. In particular, it appears that those specifications describe precisely how CMPs are required to collect users\u2019 preferences relating to the processing of personal data concerning those users and how such preferences must be processed in order to generate a TC String. Moreover, precise rules are also laid down as regards the content of the TC String as well as the storage and sharing thereof.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent in particular from the decision of 2\u00a0February 2022 that IAB Europe prescribes, as part of those rules, inter alia the standardised manner in which the various parties involved in the TCF may consult the preferences, objections and consents of users contained in the TC Strings.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, and subject to the verifications which are for the referring court to carry out, a sectoral organisation such as IAB Europe must be regarded as exerting influence over the personal data processing operations at issue in the main proceedings, for its own purposes, and determines, as a result, jointly with its members, the means behind such operations. It follows that such an organisation must be regarded as a \u2018joint controller\u2019, for the purposes of Article\u00a04(7) and Article\u00a026(1) of the GDPR, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraph\u00a057 above.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact, mentioned by the referring court, that such a sectoral organisation does not itself have direct access to the TC Strings or, therefore, to the personal data processed under the abovementioned rules by its members, with which it jointly determines the purposes and means of the processing of those data, does not, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraph\u00a058 above, preclude it from being classified as a \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of those provisions.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in response to the doubts expressed by that court, it can be ruled out that any joint controllership of that sectoral organisation extends automatically to the subsequent processing of personal data carried out by third parties, such as website or application providers, with regard to users\u2019 preferences for the purposes of targeted online advertising.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted, first, that Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR defines the \u2018processing\u2019 of personal data as \u2018any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction\u2019.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from that definition that the processing of personal data may consist of one or more operations, each relating to a different stage of that processing.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as the Court has already held, it follows from Article\u00a04(7) and Article\u00a026(1) of the GDPR that a natural or legal person may be regarded as a joint controller in respect of personal data processing operations only where that person jointly determines the purposes and means of such operations. Therefore, and without prejudice to any civil liability provided for in national law in that respect, such a natural or legal person cannot be regarded as a controller, within the meaning of those provisions, in respect of operations that precede or are subsequent in the overall chain of processing for which that person does not determine either the purposes or the means (see, by analogy, judgment of 29\u00a0July 2019, \nFashion ID\n, C-40/17, EU:C:2019:629, paragraph\u00a074).\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, a distinction must be drawn between the processing of personal data carried out by the members of IAB Europe, namely website or application providers and data brokers or advertising platforms, when the consent preferences of the users concerned are recorded in a TC String in accordance with the framework of rules established in the TCF, on the one hand, and the subsequent processing of personal data carried out by those operators and by third parties on the basis of those preferences, such as the transmission of those data to third parties or the offering of personalised advertising to those users, on the other.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That subsequent processing, subject to the verifications which are for the referring court to carry out, does not appear to involve the participation of IAB Europe, with the result that automatic responsibility on the part of such an organisation, held jointly with the abovementioned operators and with third parties, must be precluded in respect of the processing of personal data carried out on the basis of data relating to the preferences of the users concerned contained in a TC String.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, a sectoral organisation, such as IAB Europe, may be regarded as a controller in respect of such subsequent processing only where it is established that that organisation has exerted an influence over the determination of the purposes and means of that processing, which it is for the referring court to ascertain in the light of all the relevant circumstances of the case in the main proceedings.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a04(7) and Article\u00a026(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0first, a sectoral organisation, in so far as it proposes to its members a framework of rules that it has established relating to consent to the processing of personal data, which contains not only binding technical rules but also rules setting out in detail the arrangements for storing and disseminating personal data relating to such consent, must be classified as a \u2018joint controller\u2019 for the purpose of those provisions where, in the light of the particular circumstances of the individual case, it exerts influence over the personal data processing at issue, for its own purposes, and determines, as a result, jointly with its members, the purposes and means of such processing. The fact that such a sectoral organisation does not itself have direct access to the personal data processed by its members under those rules does not preclude it from holding the status of joint controller for the purpose of those provisions;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0second, the joint controllership of that sectoral organisation does not extend automatically to the subsequent processing of personal data carried out by third parties, such as website or application providers, with regard to users\u2019 preferences for the purposes of targeted online advertising.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a04(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\nmust be interpreted as meaning that a string composed of a combination of letters and characters, such as the TC String (Transparency and Consent String), containing the preferences of a user of the internet or of an application relating to that user\u2019s consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her by website or application providers as well as by brokers of such data and by advertising platforms constitutes personal data within the meaning of that provision in so far as, where those data may, by reasonable means, be associated with an identifier, such as, inter alia, the IP address of that user\u2019s device, they allow the data subject to be identified. In such circumstances, the fact that, without an external contribution, a sectoral organisation holding that string can neither access the data that are processed by its members under the rules which that organisation has established nor combine that string with other factors does not preclude that string from constituting personal data within the meaning of that provision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a04(7) and Article\u00a026(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst, a sectoral organisation, in so far as it proposes to its members a framework of rules that it has established relating to consent to the processing of personal data, which contains not only binding technical rules but also rules setting out in detail the arrangements for storing and disseminating personal data relating to such consent, must be classified as a \u2018joint controller\u2019 for the purpose of those provisions where, in the light of the particular circumstances of the individual case, it exerts influence over the personal data processing at issue, for its own purposes, and determines, as a result, jointly with its members, the purposes and means of such processing. The fact that such a sectoral organisation does not itself have direct access to the personal data processed by its members under those rules does not preclude it from holding the status of joint controller for the purpose of those provisions;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nsecond, the joint controllership of that sectoral organisation does not extend automatically to the subsequent processing of personal data carried out by third parties, such as website or application providers, with regard to users\u2019 preferences for the purposes of targeted online advertising."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}
