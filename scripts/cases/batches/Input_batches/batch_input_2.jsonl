The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 28 Jul 2016, C-191/15 (\nVerein f\u00fcr

It presumed that in principle the Rome I Regulation applies and, on the basis of Article\u00a06(2) of that regulation, held that clause 12 on the choice of applicable law was invalid, on the ground that the choice of law should not have the result of depriving consumers of the protection afforded to them by the law of their State of habitual residence. The court concluded therefrom that the validity of the other terms had to be assessed in the light of Austrian law. Finally, in relation to clauses 6, 9 and 11, the court observed that only the data protection issues had to be assessed in the light of the relevant Luxembourg law, since the Rome I Regulation does not exclude the application of Directive 95/46.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The appellate court, to which both parties to the main proceedings appealed, set aside the judgment of the first-instance court and referred the case back to it for rehearing. It considered that the Rome I Regulation was relevant for the determination of the applicable law, and only made a substantive examination of clause 12 on the choice of applicable law. It held that Article\u00a06(2) of the regulation did not allow the conclusion that that term was unlawful, and that in accordance with Article\u00a010(1) of the regulation that term should instead have been assessed in the light of Luxembourg law. Inviting the first-instance court to carry out that assessment, the appellate court observed that, if that term proved to be valid as a matter of Luxembourg law, the other terms would also have to be assessed according to that law, and a comparison with Austrian law would then have to be made in order to determine which law was more favourable for the purposes of Article\u00a06(2) of the Rome I Regulation.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Oberster Gerichtshof (Supreme Court, Austria), to which the VKI appealed, is uncertain as to the law applicable in the main proceedings. In those circumstances it decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the law applicable to an action for an injunction within the meaning of [Directive 2009/22] be determined in accordance with Article\u00a04 of [the Rome II Regulation] where the action is directed against the use of unfair contract terms by an undertaking established in a Member State which in the course of electronic commerce concludes contracts with consumers resident in other Member States, in particular in the State of the court seised?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question 1 is answered in the affirmative:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the country in which the damage occurs (Article\u00a04(1) of the Rome II Regulation) be understood as every State towards which the commercial activities of the defendant undertaking are directed, so that the terms challenged must be assessed according to the law of the State of the court seised if the qualified entity challenges the use of those terms in commerce with consumers resident in that State?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does a manifestly closer connection (Article\u00a04(3) of the Rome II Regulation) with the law of the State in which the defendant undertaking is established exist where that undertaking\u2019s terms and conditions provide that the law of that State is to apply to contracts concluded by the undertaking?\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does a choice-of-law term of that kind entail on other grounds that the contractual terms challenged must be assessed in accordance with the law of the State in which the defendant undertaking is established?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question 1 is answered in the negative:\nHow then must the law applicable to the action for an injunction be determined?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regardless of the answers to the above questions:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is a term included in general terms and conditions under which a contract concluded in the course of electronic commerce between a consumer and an operator established in another Member State is to be subject to the law of the State in which that operator is established unfair within the meaning of Article\u00a03(1) of [Directive 93/13]?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the processing of personal data by an undertaking which in the course of electronic commerce concludes contracts with consumers resident in other Member States, in accordance with Article\u00a04(1)(a) of [Directive 95/46], regardless of the law that would otherwise apply, subject exclusively to the law of the Member State in which is situated the establishment of the undertaking in the context of which the processing takes place, or must the undertaking also comply with the data protection rules of those Member States to which its commercial activities are directed?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nQuestions 1 to 3\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first three questions, which should be considered together, the referring court essentially seeks to know how the Rome I and Rome II Regulations should be interpreted for the purpose of determining the law or laws applicable to an action for an injunction within the meaning of Directive 2009/22 brought against the use of allegedly unlawful contractual terms by an undertaking established in one Member State which concludes contracts by way of electronic commerce with consumers resident in other Member States, in particular in the State of the court seised.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be observed that, as regards the respective scopes of the Rome I and Rome II Regulations, the concepts of \u2018contractual obligation\u2019 and \u2018non-contractual obligation\u2019 in those regulations must be interpreted independently by reference primarily to the regulations\u2019 scheme and purpose. Account should also be taken, in accordance with recital\u00a07 of each of those regulations, of the aim that those regulations should be applied consistently with each other and with Regulation No\u00a044/2001 (\u2018the Brussels I Regulation\u2019), which inter alia draws a distinction in Article\u00a05 between matters relating to contract and matters relating to tort, delict and quasi-delict (see judgment of 21\u00a0January 2016 in \nERGO Insurance and Gjensidige Baltic\n, C-359/14 and C-475/14, EU:C:2016:40, paragraph\u00a043).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the concept of \u2018non-contractual obligation\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a01 of the Rome II Regulation, it must be recalled that the concept of \u2018matters relating to tort, delict and quasi-delict\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a05(3) of the Brussels I Regulation includes all actions which seek to establish the liability of a defendant and are not related to a \u2018contract\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a05(1) of the Brussels I Regulation (judgment of 21\u00a0January 2016 in \nERGO Insurance and Gjensidige Baltic\n, C-359/14 and C-475/14, EU:C:2016:40, paragraph\u00a045).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the context of the Convention of 27\u00a0September 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (OJ 1978 L\u00a0304, p.\u00a036, \u2018the Brussels Convention\u2019), the Court has held that a preventive action brought by a consumer protection association for the purpose of preventing a trader from using terms considered to be unfair in contracts with private individuals is a matter relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict within the meaning of Article\u00a05(3) of the convention (judgment of 1\u00a0October 2002 in \nHenkel\n, C-167/00, EU:C:2002:555, paragraph\u00a050), that interpretation also being valid for the Brussels I Regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 13\u00a0March 2014 in \nBrogsitter\n, C-548/12, EU:C:2014:148, paragraph\u00a019).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the aim of consistent application mentioned in paragraph\u00a036 above, the view that, in matters of consumer protection, non-contractual liability extends also to the undermining of legal stability by the use of unfair terms which it is the task of consumer protection associations to prevent (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2002 in \nHenkel\n, C-167/00, EU:C:2002:555, paragraph\u00a042) is fully applicable to the interpretation of the Rome I and Rome II Regulations. It must therefore be considered that an action for an injunction under Directive 2009/22 relates to a non-contractual obligation arising out of a tort/delict within the meaning of Chapter\u00a0II of the Rome II Regulation.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06(1) of the Rome II Regulation, which forms part of Chapter\u00a0II of the regulation, provides, as a special rule relating to non-contractual obligations arising out of an act of unfair competition, for the application of the law of the country where competitive relations or the collective interests of consumers are, or are likely to be, affected.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from recital\u00a021 of the Rome II Regulation that Article\u00a06(1) expresses, in the specific field of unfair competition, the \nlex loci damni\n principle laid down in Article\u00a04(1) of the regulation.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observes in point\u00a073 of his Opinion, unfair competition within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1) of the Rome II Regulation covers the use of unfair terms inserted into general terms and conditions, as this is likely to affect the collective interests of consumers as a group and hence to influence the conditions of competition on the market.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case of an action for an injunction referred to in Directive 2009/22, the country in which the collective interests of consumers are affected within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1) of the Rome II Regulation is the country of residence of the consumers to whom the undertaking directs its activities and whose interests are defended by the relevant consumer protection association by means of that action.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be stated that Article\u00a04(3) of the Rome II Regulation, under which the law of another country applies if it is clear from all the circumstances that the tort/delict is manifestly more closely connected with a country other than that indicated in Article\u00a04(1) of the regulation, cannot lead to a different result.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General notes in point\u00a077 of his Opinion, the alternative rule in Article\u00a04(3) of the Rome II Regulation is not suited to the matter of unfair competition, since Article\u00a06(1) of the regulation aims to protect collective interests\u00a0\u2014 more extensive than the relations between the parties to the dispute\u00a0\u2014 by providing for a rule specifically suited to that purpose. That aim would not be achieved if it were permissible to block the rule on the basis of personal connections between those parties.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, the fact that Amazon EU provides in its general terms and conditions that the law of the country in which it is established is to apply to the contracts it concludes cannot legitimately constitute such a manifestly closer connection.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If it were otherwise, a professional such as Amazon EU would de facto be able, by means of such a term, to choose the law to which a non-contractual obligation is subject, and could thereby evade the conditions set out in that respect in Article\u00a014(1)(a) of the Rome II Regulation.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the law applicable to an action for an injunction within the meaning of Directive 2009/22 must be determined, without prejudice to Article\u00a01(3) of the Rome II Regulation, in accordance with Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, where what is alleged is a breach of a law aimed at protecting consumers\u2019 interests with respect to the use of unfair terms in general terms and conditions.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the law applicable to the examination of the unfairness of terms in consumer contracts which are the subject of an action for an injunction must be determined independently in accordance with the nature of those terms. Thus, where the action for an injunction aims to prevent such terms from being included in consumer contracts in order to create contractual obligations, the law applicable to the assessment of the terms must be determined in accordance with the Rome I Regulation.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the allegedly unfair terms which are the subject of the action for an injunction in the main proceedings are, for the consumers to whom they are addressed, in the nature of contractual obligations within the meaning of Article\u00a01(1) of the Rome I Regulation.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion is not affected by the collective nature of the action by means of which the validity of the terms is challenged. The fact that the action does not concern individual contracts actually concluded is inherent in the very nature of such a preventive collective action, in which an abstract review is carried out.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A distinction must therefore be drawn, for the purposes of determining the applicable law, between the assessment of the terms concerned, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the action for an injunction to prohibit the use of those terms brought by an association such as the VKI.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That distinction is necessary to ensure the uniform application of the Rome I and Rome II Regulations. Furthermore, the independent attachment of the terms in question ensures that the applicable law does not vary according to the kind of action chosen.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, in a collective action, the contractual terms concerned had to be examined in the light of the law designated as applicable under Article\u00a06(1) of the Rome II Regulation, there would be a risk that the criteria of examination would be different from those used in an individual action brought by a consumer.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the examination of terms in an individual action brought by a consumer, the law designated as applicable as the law of the contract may be different from the law designated as applicable to an action for an injunction as the law of the tort or delict. It must be observed in this respect that the level of protection of consumers still varies from one Member State to another, in accordance with Article\u00a08 of Directive 93/13, so that the assessment of a term may vary, other things being equal, according to the applicable law.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such a different attachment, as regards the law designated as applicable, of a term depending on the kind of action brought would have the effect in particular of abolishing the consistency of assessment between collective actions and individual actions which the Court has established by requiring the national courts of their own motion to draw, including for the future, all the conclusions provided for in national law that follow from the finding, in an action for an injunction, that a term included in the general terms and conditions of consumer contracts is unfair, in order that such a term should not bind consumers who have concluded a contract containing those general terms and conditions (see judgment of 26\u00a0April 2012 in \nInvitel\n, C-472/10, EU:C:2012:242, paragraph\u00a043).\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The inconsistency that would result from a term having a different attachment depending on the kind of action brought would jeopardise the objective pursued by Directives 2009/22 and 93/13 of efficaciously putting an end to the use of unfair terms.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the above that the law applicable to an action for an injunction within the meaning of Directive 2009/22 must be determined in accordance with Article\u00a06(1) of the Rome II Regulation where what is alleged is a breach of a law aimed at protecting consumers\u2019 interests with respect to the use of unfair terms in general terms and conditions, whereas the law applicable to the assessment of a particular contractual term must always be determined pursuant to the Rome I Regulation, whether this is in an individual action or in a collective action.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it should be stated that, where in an action for an injunction an assessment is being made of whether a particular contractual term is unfair, it follows from Article\u00a06(2) of the Rome I Regulation that the choice of the applicable law is without prejudice to the application of the mandatory provisions laid down by the law of the country of residence of the consumers whose interests are being defended by means of that action. Those provisions may include the provisions transposing Directive 93/13, provided that they ensure a higher level of protection for the consumer, in accordance with Article\u00a08 of that directive.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the first three questions is therefore that the Rome I and Rome II Regulations must be interpreted as meaning that, without prejudice to Article\u00a01(3) of each of those regulations, the law applicable to an action for an injunction within the meaning of Directive 2009/22 directed against the use of allegedly unfair contractual terms by an undertaking established in a Member State which concludes contracts in the course of electronic commerce with consumers resident in other Member States, in particular in the State of the court seised, must be determined in accordance with Article\u00a06(1) of the Rome II Regulation, whereas the law applicable to the assessment of a particular contractual term must always be determined pursuant to the Rome I Regulation, whether that assessment is made in an individual action or in a collective action.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 4(a)\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 4(a) the referring court seeks to know whether a term in the general terms and conditions of a contract concluded in the course of electronic commerce between a seller or supplier and a consumer, under which the contract is to be governed by the law of the Member State in which the seller or supplier is established, is unfair within the meaning of Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 93/13.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with that provision, a contractual term which has not been individually negotiated must be regarded as unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties\u2019 rights and obligations to the detriment of the consumer.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 93/13 specifies that a term must always be regarded as not individually negotiated where it has been drafted in advance by the seller or supplier and the consumer has therefore not been able to influence the substance of the term, particularly in the context of a pre-formulated standard contract. As the Advocate General observes in point\u00a084 of his Opinion, general terms and conditions such as those at issue in the main proceedings correspond to that description.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a04(1) of Directive 93/13, a contractual term may be declared unfair only after a case-by-case examination of all the relevant circumstances, including the nature of the goods or services which are the subject of the contract.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for the national court to determine whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, a term meets the requirements of good faith, balance and transparency. The Court nonetheless has jurisdiction to elicit from the provisions of Directive 93/13 the criteria that the national court may or must apply when making such an examination (see, to that effect, judgment of 30\u00a0April 2014 in \nK\u00e1sler and K\u00e1slern\u00e9 R\u00e1bai\n, C-26/13, EU:C:2014:282, paragraphs\u00a040 and 45 and the case-law cited).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case of a term such as clause 12 of the general terms and conditions at issue in the main proceedings, concerning the applicable law, it must first be observed that EU legislation in principle allows choice-of-law terms. Article\u00a06(2) of the Rome I Regulation provides that the parties may choose the law applicable to a consumer contract, provided that the protection is ensured which the consumer is afforded by provisions of the law of his country that cannot be derogated from by agreement.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, as the Advocate General observes in point\u00a094 of his Opinion, a pre-formulated term on the choice of the applicable law designating the law of the Member State in which the seller or supplier is established is unfair only in so far as it displays certain specific characteristics inherent in its wording or context which cause a significant imbalance in the rights and obligations of the parties.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the unfairness of such a term may result from a formulation that does not comply with the requirement of being drafted in plain and intelligible language set out in Article\u00a05 of Directive 93/13. That requirement must, having regard to the consumer\u2019s weak position vis-\u00e0-vis the seller or supplier with respect in particular to his level of knowledge, be interpreted broadly (see, to that effect, judgment of 23\u00a0April 2015 in \nVan Hove\n, C-96/14, EU:C:2015:262, paragraph\u00a040 and the case-law cited).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, where the effects of a term are specified by mandatory statutory provisions, it is essential that the seller or supplier informs the consumer of those provisions (see, to that effect, judgment of 26\u00a0April 2012 in \nInvitel\n, C-472/10, EU:C:2012:242, paragraph\u00a029). That is the case of Article\u00a06(2) of the Rome I Regulation, which provides that the choice of applicable law must not have the result of depriving the consumer of the protection afforded to him by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the law which would have been applicable in the absence of choice.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the mandatory nature of the requirement in Article\u00a06(2) of the Rome I Regulation, the court faced with a choice-of-applicable-law term will, where a consumer with his principal residence in Austria is involved, have to apply those Austrian statutory provisions which, under Austrian law, cannot be derogated from by agreement. It will be for the referring court to identify those provisions if need be.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to Question 4(a) is therefore that Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 93/13 must be interpreted as meaning that a term in the general terms and conditions of a seller or supplier which has not been individually negotiated, under which the contract concluded with a consumer in the course of electronic commerce is to be governed by the law of the Member State in which the seller or supplier is established, is unfair in so far as it leads the consumer into error by giving him the impression that only the law of that Member State applies to the contract, without informing him that under Article\u00a06(2) of the Rome I Regulation he also enjoys the protection of the mandatory provisions of the law that would be applicable in the absence of that term, this being for the national court to ascertain in the light of all the relevant circumstances.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 4(b)\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 4(b) the referring court seeks essentially to know whether Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the treatment of personal data by an undertaking engaged in electronic commerce is governed by the law of the Member State to which that undertaking directs its activities.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, each Member State is to apply the national provisions it adopts pursuant to that directive to the processing of personal data where the processing is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of the Member State.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the processing of data in the context of the activities of an establishment is governed by the law of the Member State in whose territory that establishment is situated.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, first, the concept of \u2018establishment\u2019 for the purposes of Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, the Court has previously held that it extends to any real and effective activity, even a minimal one, exercised through stable arrangements (judgment of 1\u00a0October 2015 in \nWeltimmo\n, C-230/14, EU:C:2015:639, paragraph\u00a031).\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General states in point\u00a0119 of his Opinion, while the fact that the undertaking responsible for the data processing does not have a branch or subsidiary in a Member State does not preclude it from having an establishment there within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, such an establishment cannot exist merely because the undertaking\u2019s website is accessible there.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rather, as the Court has previously held, both the degree of stability of the arrangements and the effective exercise of activities in the Member State in question must be assessed (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2015 in \nWeltimmo\n, C-230/14, EU:C:2015:639, paragraph\u00a029).\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, second, the question whether the processing of personal data concerned is carried out \u2018in the context of the activities\u2019 of that establishment within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, the Court has pointed out that that provision requires the processing of personal data in question to be carried out not \u2018by\u2019 the establishment concerned itself but only \u2018in the context of the activities\u2019 of the establishment (judgment of 1\u00a0October 2015 in \nWeltimmo\n, C-230/14, EU:C:2015:639, paragraph\u00a035).\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for the national court to determine, in the light of that case-law and taking account of all the relevant circumstances of the case at issue in the main proceedings, whether Amazon EU carries out the data processing in question in the context of the activities of an establishment situated in a Member State other than Luxembourg.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observes in point\u00a0128 of his Opinion, if the referring court were to conclude that the establishment in the context of which Amazon EU carries out the processing of that data is situated in Germany, it would be for German law to govern the processing.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Question 4(b) is that Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data carried out by an undertaking engaged in electronic commerce is governed by the law of the Member State to which that undertaking directs its activities, if it is shown that the undertaking carries out the data processing in question in the context of the activities of an establishment situated in that Member State. It is for the national court to ascertain whether that is the case.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRegulation (EC) No\u00a0593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17\u00a0June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) and Regulation (EC) No\u00a0864/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11\u00a0July 2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II) must be interpreted as meaning that, without prejudice to Article\u00a01(3) of each of those regulations, the law applicable to an action for an injunction within the meaning of Directive 2009/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23\u00a0April 2009 on injunctions for the protection of consumers\u2019 interests directed against the use of allegedly unfair contractual terms by an undertaking established in a Member State which concludes contracts in the course of electronic commerce with consumers resident in other Member States, in particular in the State of the court seised, must be determined in accordance with Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation No\u00a0864/2007, whereas the law applicable to the assessment of a particular contractual term must always be determined pursuant to Regulation No\u00a0593/2008, whether that assessment is made in an individual action or in a collective action.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a03(1) of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5\u00a0April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts must be interpreted as meaning that a term in the general terms and conditions of a seller or supplier which has not been individually negotiated, under which the contract concluded with a consumer in the course of electronic commerce is to be governed by the law of the Member State in which the seller or supplier is established, is unfair in so far as it leads the consumer into error by giving him the impression that only the law of that Member State applies to the contract, without informing him that under Article\u00a06(2) of Regulation No\u00a0593/2008 he also enjoys the protection of the mandatory provisions of the law that would be applicable in the absence of that term, this being for the national court to ascertain in the light of all the relevant circumstances.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data carried out by an undertaking engaged in electronic commerce is governed by the law of the Member State to which that undertaking directs its activities, if it is shown that the undertaking carries out the data processing in question in the context of the activities of an establishment situated in that Member State. It is for the national court to ascertain whether that is the case."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 11 Dec 2014, C-212/13 (\nRyne\u0161\n)\nGeneral data protection law \n

of personal data is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, which is recognised both in Article\u00a08 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in the general principles of Community law; \u2026 for that reason, the approximation of those laws must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community; \n...\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 there should be excluded the processing of data carried out by a natural person in the exercise of activities which are exclusively personal or domestic, such as correspondence and the holding of records of addresses; \n...\n(14) \u00a0\u2026 given the importance of the developments under way, in the framework of the information society, of the techniques used to capture, transmit, manipulate, record, store or communicate sound and image data relating to

Sb. on the Protection of Personal Data and the Amendment of Various Laws (\u2018Law No\u00a0101/2000\u2019) provides:\n\u2018This Law does not cover the processing of personal data carried out by a

he processes that data without the consent of the data subject, or if he does not provide the data subject with the relevant information or if he does not comply with the obligation to report to the

data subject. In the absence of such consent, personal data may be processed where doing so is necessary to safeguard the legally protected rights and interests of the data controller, recipient or other data subjects. However, such processing must not adversely affect the data subject\u2019s right to respect for his private and family life.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the period from 5\u00a0October 2007 to 11\u00a0April 2008, Mr\u00a0Ryne\u0161 installed and used a camera system located under the eaves of his family home. The camera was installed in a fixed position and could not turn; it recorded the entrance to his home, the public footpath and the entrance to the house opposite. The system allowed only a visual recording, which was stored on recording equipment in the form of a continuous loop, that is to say, on a hard disk drive. As soon as it reached full capacity, the device would record over the existing recording, erasing the old material. No monitor was installed on the recording equipment, so the images could not be studied in real time. Only Mr\u00a0Ryne\u0161 had direct access to the system and the data.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Nejvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed spr\u00e1vn\u00ed soud (Supreme Administrative Court, Czech Republic; or \u2018the referring court\u2019) notes that Mr\u00a0Ryne\u0161\u2019s only reason for operating the camera was to protect the property, health and life of his family and himself. Indeed, both Mr\u00a0Ryne\u0161 and his family had for several years been subjected to attacks by persons unknown whom it had not been possible to identify. Furthermore, the windows of the family home had been broken on several occasions between 2005 and 2007.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the night of 6 to 7\u00a0October 2007, a further attack took place. One of the windows of Mr\u00a0Ryne\u0161\u2019s home was broken by a shot from a catapult. The video surveillance system at issue made it possible to identify two suspects. The recording was handed over to the police and relied on in the course of the subsequent criminal proceedings.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 4\u00a0August 2008, following a request from one of the suspects for confirmation that Mr\u00a0Ryne\u0161\u2019s surveillance system was lawful, the Office found that Mr\u00a0Ryne\u0161 had infringed Law No\u00a0101/2000, since:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a data controller, he had used a camera system to collect, without their consent, the personal data of persons moving along the street or entering the house opposite;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he had not informed those persons of the processing of that personal data, the extent and purpose of that processing, by whom and by what means the personal data would be processed, or who would have access to the personal data; and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a data controller, Mr\u00a0Ryne\u0161 had not fulfilled the obligation to report that processing to the Office.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Ryne\u0161 brought an action challenging that decision, which the M\u011bstsk\u00fd soud v Praze (Prague City Court) dismissed by judgment of 25\u00a0April 2012. Mr\u00a0Ryne\u0161 brought an appeal on a point of law against that judgment before the referring court.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Nejvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed spr\u00e1vn\u00ed soud decided to stay proceedings and refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018Can the operation of a camera system installed on a family home for the purposes of the protection of the property, health and life of the owners of the home be classified as the processing of personal data \u201cby a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity\u201d for the purposes of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 \u2026, even though such a system also monitors a public space?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the question referred\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its question, the referring court essentially asks whether, on a proper construction of the second indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, the operation of a camera system, as a result of which a video recording of people is stored on a continuous recording device such as a hard disk drive, installed by an individual on his family home for the purposes of protecting the property, health and life of the home owners, but which also monitors a public space, amounts to the processing of data in the course of a purely personal or household activity, for the purposes of that provision.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that, under Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 95/46, the directive is to apply to \u2018the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means, and to the processing otherwise than by automatic means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system\u2019.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The term \u2018personal data\u2019 as used in that provision covers, according to the definition under Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46, \u2018any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019, an identifiable person being \u2018one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference \u2026 to one or more factors specific to his physical \u2026 identity\u2019.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the image of a person recorded by a camera constitutes personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 inasmuch as it makes it possible to identify the person concerned.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the \u2018processing of personal data\u2019, it should be noted that Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 defines this as \u2018any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, \u2026 such as collection, recording, \u2026 storage\u2019.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As can be seen, in particular, from recitals 15 and 16 to Directive 95/46, video surveillance falls, in principle, within the scope of that directive in so far as it constitutes automatic processing.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Surveillance in the form of a video recording of persons, as in the case before the referring court, which is stored on a continuous recording device\u00a0\u2014 the hard disk drive\u00a0\u2014 constitutes, pursuant to Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 95/46, the automatic processing of personal data.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court is uncertain whether such processing should nevertheless, in circumstances such as those of the case before it, escape the application of Directive 95/46 in so far as it is carried out \u2018in the course of a purely personal or household activity\u2019 for the purposes of the second indent of Article\u00a03(2) of the directive.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is clear from Article\u00a01 of that directive and recital 10 thereto, Directive 95/46 is intended to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data (see \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a066).\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it should be noted that, according to settled case-law, the protection of the fundamental right to private life guaranteed under Article\u00a07 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019) requires that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (see \nIPI\n, C-473/12, EU:C:2013:715, paragraph\u00a039, and \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a052).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the provisions of Directive 95/46, in so far as they govern the processing of personal data liable to infringe fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to privacy, must necessarily be interpreted in the light of the fundamental rights set out in the Charter (see \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a068), the exception provided for in the second indent of Article\u00a03(2) of that directive must be narrowly construed.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 falls to be narrowly construed has its basis also in the very wording of that provision, under which the directive does not cover the processing of data where the activity in the course of which that processing is carried out is a \u2018purely\u2019 personal or household activity, that is to say, not simply a personal or household activity.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, it must be held that, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a053 of his Opinion, the processing of personal data comes within the exception provided for in the second indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 only where it is carried out in the purely personal or household setting of the person processing the data.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, so far as natural persons are concerned, correspondence and the keeping of address books constitute, in the light of recital 12 to Directive 95/46, a \u2018purely personal or household activity\u2019 even if they incidentally concern or may concern the private life of other persons.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent that video surveillance such as that at issue in the main proceedings covers, even partially, a public space and is accordingly directed outwards from the private setting of the person processing the data in that manner, it cannot be regarded as an activity which is a purely \u2018personal or household\u2019 activity for the purposes of the second indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, the application of Directive 95/46 makes it possible, where appropriate, to take into account\u00a0\u2014 in accordance, in particular, with Articles\u00a07(f), 11(2), and 13(1)(d) and (g) of that directive\u00a0\u2014 legitimate interests pursued by the controller, such as the protection of the property, health and life of his family and himself, as in the case in the main proceedings.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the answer to the question referred is that the second indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the operation of a camera system, as a result of which a video recording of people is stored on a continuous recording device such as a hard disk drive, installed by an individual on his family home for the purposes of protecting the property, health and life of the home owners, but which also monitors a public space, does not amount to the processing of data in the course of a purely personal or household activity, for the purposes of that provision.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules:\nThe second indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as meaning that the operation of a camera system, as a result of which a video recording of people is stored on a continuous recording device such as a hard disk drive, installed by an individual on his family home for the purposes of protecting the property, health and life of the home owners, but which also monitors a public space, does not amount to the processing of data in the course of a purely personal or household activity, for the purposes of that provision."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 24 Sep 2019, C-136/17 (\nGC and Others\n)\nGeneral data protection law

The photomontage was placed online during the campaign for the cantonal elections in which GC was then a candidate. On the date on which her request for de-referencing was refused she was neither a local councillor nor a candidate for local elective office and no longer served as the head of cabinet of the mayor of the municipality.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0AF requested de-referencing of links leading to an article in the daily newspaper \nLib\u00e9ration\n of 9\u00a0September 2008, reproduced on the site of the Centre contre les manipulations mentales (Centre against mental manipulation) (CCMM) (France), concerning the suicide of a member of the Church of Scientology in December 2006. AF is mentioned in that article in his capacity as public relations officer of the Church of Scientology, an occupation which he has since ceased to exercise. Furthermore, the author of the article states that he contacted AF in order to obtain his version of the facts and describes the comments received on that occasion.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BH requested the de-referencing of links leading to articles, mainly in the press, concerning the judicial investigation opened in June 1995 into the funding of the Parti r\u00e9publicain (PR), in which he was questioned with a number of businessmen and political personalities. The proceedings against him were closed by an order discharging him on 26\u00a0February 2010. Most of the links are to articles contemporaneous with the opening of the investigation and therefore do not mention the outcome of the proceedings.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ED requested the de-referencing of links leading to two articles published in \nNice Matin\n and \nLe Figaro\n reporting the criminal hearing during which he was sentenced to 7\u00a0years\u2019 imprisonment and an additional penalty of 10\u00a0years\u2019 social and judicial supervision for sexual assaults on children under the age of 15. One of the accounts of the court proceedings also mentions several intimate details relating to ED that were revealed at the hearing.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the rejections by Google of their requests for de-referencing, the applicants in the main proceedings brought complaints before the CNIL, seeking for Google to be ordered to de-reference the links in question. By letters dated 24\u00a0April 2015, 28\u00a0August 2015, 21\u00a0March 2016 and 9\u00a0May 2016 respectively, the president of the CNIL informed them that the procedures on their complaints had been closed.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicants in the main proceedings thereupon made applications to the referring court, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State, France), against those refusals of the CNIL to serve formal notice on Google to carry out the de-referencing requested. The applications were joined by the referring court.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finding that the applications raised several serious difficulties of interpretation of Directive 95/46, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the specific responsibilities, powers and capabilities of the operator of a search engine, does the prohibition imposed on other controllers of processing data caught by Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46, subject to the exceptions laid down there, also apply to this operator as the controller of processing by means of that search engine?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question 1 should be answered in the affirmative:\n[(a)]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46 be interpreted as meaning that the prohibition so imposed on the operator of a search engine of processing data covered by those provisions, subject to the exceptions laid down by that directive, would require the operator to grant as a matter of course the requests for de-referencing in relation to links to web pages concerning such data?\n[(b)]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From that perspective, how must the exceptions laid down in Article\u00a08(2)(a) and (e) of Directive 95/46 be interpreted, when they apply to the operator of a search engine, in the light of its specific responsibilities, powers and capabilities? In particular, may such an operator refuse a request for de-referencing, if it establishes that the links at issue lead to content which, although comprising data falling within the categories listed in Article\u00a08(1), is also covered by the exceptions laid down by Article\u00a08(2) of the directive, in particular points (a) and (e)?\n[(c)]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, when the links subject to the request for de-referencing lead to processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or for those of artistic or literary expression, on which basis, in accordance with Article\u00a09 of Directive 95/46, data within the categories mentioned in Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of the directive may be collected and processed, must the provisions of Directive 95/46 be interpreted as allowing the operator of a search engine, on that ground, to refuse a request for de-referencing?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question 1 should be answered in the negative:\n[(a)]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which specific requirements of Directive 95/46 must be met by the operator of a search engine, in view of its responsibilities, powers and capabilities?\n[(b)]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the operator establishes that the web pages at the end of the links subject to the request for de-referencing comprise data whose publication on those pages is unlawful, must the provisions of Directive 95/46 be interpreted as:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0requiring the operator of a search engine to remove those links from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of the name of the person making the request; or\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0meaning only that it is to take that factor into consideration in assessing the merits of the request for de-referencing, or\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0meaning that this factor has no bearing on the assessment it is to make?\nFurthermore, if that factor is not irrelevant, how is the lawfulness of the publication on web pages of the data at issue which stem from processing falling outside the territorial scope of Directive 95/46 and, accordingly, of the national laws implementing it to be assessed?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Irrespective of the answer to be given to Question 1:\n[(a)]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whether or not publication of the personal data on the web page at the end of the link at issue is lawful, must the provisions of Directive 95/46 be interpreted as:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0requiring the operator of a search engine, when the person making the request establishes that the data in question have become incomplete or inaccurate, or are no longer up to date, to grant the corresponding request for de-referencing;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0more specifically, requiring the operator of a search engine, when the person making the request shows that, having regard to the conduct of the legal proceedings, the information relating to an earlier stage of those proceedings is no longer consistent with the current reality of his situation, to de-reference the links to web pages comprising such information?\n[(b)]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article\u00a08(5) of Directive 95/46 be interpreted as meaning that information relating to the investigation of an individual or reporting a trial and the resulting conviction and sentencing constitutes data relating to offences and to criminal convictions? More generally, does a web page comprising data referring to the convictions of or legal proceedings involving a natural person fall within the ambit of those provisions?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The questions referred concern the interpretation of Directive 95/46, which was applicable at the time when the request for a preliminary ruling was submitted. That directive was repealed with effect from 25\u00a0May 2018, from which date Regulation 2016/679 applies.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court will consider the questions referred from the point of view of Directive 95/46, while also taking Regulation 2016/679 into account in its analysis of them, in order to ensure that its answers will in any event be of use to the referring court.\n\u00a0\nQ\nuestion\n 1\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court essentially asks whether the provisions of Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the prohibition or restrictions relating to the processing of special categories of personal data, mentioned in those provisions, apply also, subject to the exceptions provided for by the directive, to the operator of a search engine in the context of his responsibilities, powers and capabilities as the controller of the processing carried out for the needs of the functioning of the search engine.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be recalled, first, that the activity of a search engine consisting in finding information published or placed on the internet by third parties, indexing it automatically, storing it temporarily and, finally, making it available to internet users according to a particular order of preference must be classified as \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 when that information contains personal data and, second, that the operator of the search engine must be regarded as the \u2018controller\u2019 in respect of that processing within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of that directive (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a041).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data in the context of the activity of a search engine can be distinguished from and is additional to that carried out by publishers of websites, consisting in loading those data on an internet page, and that activity plays a decisive role in the overall dissemination of those data in that it renders the latter accessible to any internet user making a search on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name, including to internet users who otherwise would not have found the web page on which those data are published. Moreover, the organisation and aggregation of information published on the internet that are effected by search engines with the aim of facilitating their users\u2019 access to that information may, when users carry out their search on the basis of an individual\u2019s name, result in them obtaining through the list of results a structured overview of the information relating to that individual that can be found on the internet, enabling them to establish a more or less detailed profile of the data subject (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraphs\u00a035 to 37).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, in so far as the activity of a search engine is liable to affect significantly, and additionally compared with that of the publishers of websites, the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data, the operator of the search engine as the person determining the purposes and means of that activity must ensure, within the framework of his responsibilities, powers and capabilities, that the activity meets the requirements of Directive 95/46 in order that the guarantees laid down by the directive may have full effect and that effective and complete protection of data subjects, in particular of their right to privacy, may actually be achieved (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a038).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first question referred aims to determine whether, in the context of his responsibilities, powers and capabilities, the operator of a search engine must also comply with the requirements laid down by Directive 95/46 with respect to the special categories of personal data mentioned in Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of the directive, where such data are among the information published or placed on the internet by third parties and are the subject of processing by that operator for the purposes of the functioning of his search engine.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the special categories of data, Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 95/46 provides that the Member States are to prohibit the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life. Certain exceptions to and derogations from that prohibition are provided for inter alia in Article\u00a08(2) of the directive.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a08(5) of Directive 95/46 states that the processing of data relating to offences, criminal convictions or security measures may be carried out only under the control of official authority, or if suitable specific safeguards are provided under national law, subject to derogations which may be granted by the Member State under national provisions providing suitable specific safeguards. However, a complete register of criminal convictions may be kept only under the control of official authority. Member States may provide that data relating to administrative sanctions or judgments in civil cases are also to be processed under the control of official authority.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The content of Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46 was taken over, with some changes, in Article\u00a09(1) and Article\u00a010 of Regulation 2016/679.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be stated, first, that it is apparent from the wording of those provisions of Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679 that the prohibition and restrictions laid down by them apply, subject to the exceptions provided for by the directive and the regulation, to every kind of processing of the special categories of data referred to in those provisions and to all controllers carrying out such processing.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, no other provision of that directive or that regulation provides for a general derogation from that prohibition or those restrictions for processing such as that carried out in the context of the activity of a search engine. On the contrary, as already pointed out in paragraph\u00a037 above, it follows from the general scheme of those instruments that the operator of a search engine must, in the same way as any other controller, ensure, in the context of his responsibilities, powers and capabilities, that the processing of personal data carried out by him complies with the respective requirements of Directive 95/46 or Regulation 2016/679.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, an interpretation of Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46 or Article\u00a09(1) and Article\u00a010 of Regulation 2016/679 that excluded a priori and generally the activity of a search engine from the specific requirements laid down by those provisions for processing relating to the special categories of data referred to there would run counter to the purpose of those provisions, namely to ensure enhanced protection as regards such processing, which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data, is liable to constitute, as also follows from recital\u00a033 of that directive and recital\u00a051 of that regulation, a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights to privacy and the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While, contrary to the submissions of Google in particular, the specific features of the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine in connection with the activity of the search engine cannot thus justify the operator being exempted from compliance with Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a09(1) and Article\u00a010 of Regulation 2016/679, those specific features may, however, have an effect on the extent of the operator\u2019s responsibility and obligations under those provisions.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be observed in this respect that, as the European Commission emphasises, the operator of a search engine is responsible not because personal data referred to in those provisions appear on a web page published by a third party but because of the referencing of that page and in particular the display of the link to that web page in the list of results presented to internet users following a search on the basis of an individual\u2019s name, since such a display of the link in such a list is liable significantly to affect the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of the personal data relating to him (see, to that effect, judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a080).\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, having regard to the responsibilities, powers and capabilities of the operator of a search engine as the controller of the processing carried out in connection with the activity of the search engine, the prohibitions and restrictions in Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46 and Articles\u00a09(1) and 10 of Regulation 2016/679\u00a0\u2014 as indicated by the Advocate General in point\u00a056 of his Opinion and as stated in essence by all the parties who have expressed an opinion on the point\u00a0\u2014 can apply to that operator only by reason of that referencing and thus via a verification, under the supervision of the competent national authorities, on the basis of a request by the data subject.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the above that the answer to Question 1 is that the provisions of Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the prohibition or restrictions relating to the processing of special categories of personal data, mentioned in those provisions, apply also, subject to the exceptions provided for by the directive, to the operator of a search engine in the context of his responsibilities, powers and capabilities as the controller of the processing carried out in connection with the activity of the search engine, on the occasion of a verification performed by that operator, under the supervision of the competent national authorities, following a request by the data subject.\n\u00a0\nQ\nuestion\n 2\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, which consists of three parts, the referring court essentially asks\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whether the provisions of Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the operator of a search engine is required by those provisions, subject to the exceptions provided for by the directive, to accede to requests for de-referencing in relation to links to web pages containing personal data falling within the special categories referred to by those provisions;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whether Article\u00a08(2)(a) and (e) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, pursuant to that article, such an operator may refuse to accede to a request for de-referencing if he establishes that the links at issue lead to content comprising personal data falling within the special categories referred to in Article\u00a08(1) but whose processing is covered by one of the exceptions laid down in Article\u00a08(2)(a) and (e) of the directive; and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whether the provisions of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the operator of a search engine may also refuse to accede to a request for de-referencing on the ground that the links whose de-referencing is requested lead to web pages on which the personal data falling within the special categories referred to in Article\u00a08(1) or (5) of the directive are published solely for journalistic purposes or those of artistic or literary expression and the publication is therefore covered by the exception in Article\u00a09 of the directive.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted, as a preliminary point, that in the context of Directive 95/46 requests for de-referencing such as those at issue in the main proceedings have their basis in particular in Article\u00a012(b) of the directive, under which the Member States are to guarantee data subjects the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of data whose processing does not comply with the directive.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, in accordance with Article\u00a014(a) of Directive 95/46, the Member States are to grant the data subject the right, at least in the cases referred to in Article\u00a07(e) and (f) of the directive, to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his or her particular situation to the processing of data relating to him or her, save where otherwise provided by national legislation.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it must be recalled that the Court has held that Article\u00a012(b) and Article\u00a014(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, in order to comply with the rights laid down in those provisions and in so far as the conditions laid down by those provisions are in fact satisfied, the operator of a search engine is obliged to remove from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a person\u2019s name links to web pages, published by third parties and containing information relating to that person, also in a case where that name or information is not erased beforehand or simultaneously from those web pages, and even, as the case may be, when its publication in itself on those pages is lawful (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a088).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has also held that, when appraising the conditions for the application of those provisions, it should inter alia be examined whether the data subject has a right that the information in question relating to him or her personally should, at the present point in time, no longer be linked to his or her name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his or her name, without it being necessary in order to find such a right that the inclusion of the information in question in that list causes prejudice to the data subject. As the data subject may, in the light of his or her fundamental rights under Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, request that the information in question no longer be made available to the general public on account of its inclusion in such a list of results, those rights override, as a rule, not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in having access to that information upon a search relating to the data subject\u2019s name. However, that would not be the case if it appeared, for particular reasons, such as the role played by the data subject in public life, that the interference with his or her fundamental rights is justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having, on account of its inclusion in the list of results, access to the information in question (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a099).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to Regulation 2016/679, the EU legislature laid down, in Article\u00a017 of the regulation, a provision specifically governing the \u2018right to erasure\u2019, also called the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 in the heading of that article.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a017(1) of the regulation, the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller has the obligation to erase those data without undue delay where one of the grounds set out in that provision applies. As grounds, the provision mentions the cases in which the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were processed; the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based and there is no other legal ground for the processing; the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article\u00a021(1) or (2) of the regulation, which replaces Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46; the data have been unlawfully processed; the data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation; or the data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services to children.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Article\u00a017(3) of Regulation 2016/679 states that Article\u00a017(1) of the regulation is not to apply to the extent that the processing is necessary on one of the grounds set out in Article\u00a017(3). Among those grounds is, in Article\u00a017(3)(a) of the regulation, the exercise of the right of freedom of expression and information.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The circumstance that Article\u00a017(3)(a) of Regulation 2016/679 now expressly provides that the data subject\u2019s right to erasure is excluded where the processing is necessary for the exercise of the right of information, guaranteed by Article\u00a011 of the Charter, is an expression of the fact that the right to protection of personal data is not an absolute right but, as recital\u00a04 of the regulation states, must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality (see also judgment of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraph\u00a048, and Opinion 1/15 (EU-Canada PNR Agreement) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0136).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should be recalled that Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter accepts that limitations may be imposed on the exercise of rights such as those set forth in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, as long as the limitations are provided for by law, respect the essence of those rights and freedoms and, subject to the principle of proportionality, are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others (judgment of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraph\u00a050).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulation 2016/679, in particular Article\u00a017(3)(a), thus expressly lays down the requirement to strike a balance between the fundamental rights to privacy and protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, on the one hand, and the fundamental right of freedom of information guaranteed by Article\u00a011 of the Charter, on the other.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is in the light of those considerations that an examination must be made of the conditions in which the operator of a search engine is required to accede to a request for de-referencing and thus to delete from the list of results displayed following a search on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name the link to a web page on which there are personal data falling within the special categories in Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be stated, to begin with, that the processing by the operator of a search engine of the special categories of data referred to in Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 95/46 is capable in principle of being covered by the exceptions in Article\u00a08(2)(a) and (e), mentioned by the referring court, which provides that the prohibition is not to apply where the data subject has given his or her explicit consent to such processing, except where the laws of the Member State concerned prohibit such consent, or where the processing relates to data which are manifestly made public by the data subject. Those exceptions have now been repeated in Article\u00a09(2)(a) and (e) of Regulation 2016/679. In addition, Article\u00a09(2)(g) of the regulation, which essentially reproduces Article\u00a08(4) of Directive 95/46, allows the processing of those categories of data where it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of European Union or Member State law which must be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to the exception in Article\u00a08(2)(a) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a09(2)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, it follows from the definition of \u2018consent\u2019 in Article\u00a02(h) of that directive and Article\u00a04(11) of that regulation that the consent must be \u2018specific\u2019 and must therefore relate specifically to the processing carried out in connection with the activity of the search engine, and thus to the fact that the processing enables third parties, by means of a search based on the data subject\u2019s name, to obtain a list of results including links leading to web pages containing sensitive data relating to him or her. In practice, it is scarcely conceivable\u00a0\u2014 nor, moreover, does it appear from the documents before the Court\u00a0\u2014 that the operator of a search engine will seek the express consent of data subjects before processing personal data concerning them for the purposes of his referencing activity. In any event, as inter alia the French and Polish Governments and the Commission have observed, the mere fact that a person makes a request for de-referencing means, in principle, at least at the time of making the request, that he or she no longer consents to the processing carried out by the operator of the search engine. In this connection, it should also be recalled that Article\u00a017(1)(b) of the regulation mentions among the grounds justifying the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 the data subject\u2019s withdrawal of the consent on which the processing is based in accordance with Article\u00a09(2)(a) of the regulation, where there is no other legal ground for the processing.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, the circumstance, referred to in Article\u00a08(2)(e) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a09(2)(e) of Regulation 2016/679, that the data in question are manifestly made public by the data subject is intended to apply, as has been observed by all those who have made submissions on the point, both to the operator of the search engine and to the publisher of the web page concerned.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, in such a case, despite the presence on the web page referenced of personal data falling within the special categories in Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a09(1) of Regulation 2016/679, the processing of those data by the operator of the search engine in connection with its activity, provided that the other conditions of lawfulness are satisfied, in particular those laid down by Article\u00a06 of the directive or Article\u00a05 of the regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a072), is compliant with those provisions.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, even in that case, the data subject may, pursuant to Article\u00a014(a) of Directive 95/46 or Article\u00a017(1)(c) and Article\u00a021(1) of Regulation 2016/679, have the right to de-referencing of the link in question on grounds relating to his or her particular situation.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, when the operator of a search engine receives a request for de-referencing, he must ascertain, having regard to the reasons of substantial public interest referred to in Article\u00a08(4) of Directive 95/46 or Article\u00a09(2)(g) of Regulation 2016/679 and in compliance with the conditions laid down in those provisions, whether the inclusion of the link to the web page in question in the list displayed following a search on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of information of internet users potentially interested in accessing that web page by means of such a search, a right protected by Article\u00a011 of the Charter. While the data subject\u2019s rights protected by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter override, as a general rule, the freedom of information of internet users, that balance may, however, depend, in specific cases, on the nature of the information in question and its sensitivity for the data subject\u2019s private life and on the interest of the public in having that information, an interest which may vary, in particular, according to the role played by the data subject in public life (see, to that effect, judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a081).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, where the processing relates to the special categories of data mentioned in Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46 or Article\u00a09(1) and Article\u00a010 of Regulation 2016/679, the interference with the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights to privacy and protection of personal data is, as observed in paragraph\u00a044 above, liable to be particularly serious because of the sensitivity of those data.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, where the operator of a search engine receives a request for de-referencing relating to a link to a web page on which such sensitive data are published, the operator must, on the basis of all the relevant factors of the particular case and taking into account the seriousness of the interference with the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights to privacy and protection of personal data laid down in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, ascertain, having regard to the reasons of substantial public interest referred to in Article\u00a08(4) of Directive 95/46 or Article\u00a09(2)(g) of Regulation 2016/679 and in compliance with the conditions laid down in those provisions, whether the inclusion of that link in the list of results displayed following a search on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name is strictly necessary for protecting the freedom of information of internet users potentially interested in accessing that web page by means of such a search, protected by Article\u00a011 of the Charter.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all the above considerations that the answer to Question 2 is as follows:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provisions of Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the operator of a search engine is in principle required by those provisions, subject to the exceptions provided for by the directive, to accede to requests for de-referencing in relation to links to web pages containing personal data falling within the special categories referred to by those provisions.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a08(2)(e) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, pursuant to that article, such an operator may refuse to accede to a request for de-referencing if he establishes that the links at issue lead to content comprising personal data falling within the special categories referred to in Article\u00a08(1) but whose processing is covered by the exception in Article\u00a08(2)(e) of the directive, provided that the processing satisfies all the other conditions of lawfulness laid down by the directive, and unless the data subject has the right under Article\u00a014(a) of the directive to object to that processing on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provisions of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, where the operator of a search engine has received a request for de-referencing relating to a link to a web page on which personal data falling within the special categories referred to in Article\u00a08(1) or (5) of Directive 95/46 are published, the operator must, on the basis of all the relevant factors of the particular case and taking into account the seriousness of the interference with the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights to privacy and protection of personal data laid down in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, ascertain, having regard to the reasons of substantial public interest referred to in Article\u00a08(4) of the directive and in compliance with the conditions laid down in that provision, whether the inclusion of that link in the list of results displayed following a search on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name is strictly necessary for protecting the freedom of information of internet users potentially interested in accessing that web page by means of such a search, protected by Article\u00a011 of the Charter.\n\u00a0\nQ\nuestion\n 3\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As this question is asked only in the event that Question 1 is answered in the negative, there is no need to answer it, given the affirmative answer to Question 1.\n\u00a0\nQ\nuestion\n 4\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, the referring court essentially asks whether the provisions of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0first, information relating to legal proceedings brought against an individual and, as the case may be, information relating to an ensuing conviction are data relating to \u2018offences\u2019 and \u2018criminal convictions\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a08(5) of Directive 95/46, and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0second, the operator of a search engine is required to accede to a request for de-referencing relating to links to web pages displaying such information, where the information relates to an earlier stage of the legal proceedings in question and, having regard to the progress of the proceedings, no longer corresponds to the current situation?\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it must be stated, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a0100 of his Opinion and as submitted inter alia by the French Government, Ireland, the Italian and Polish Governments and the Commission, that information concerning legal proceedings brought against an individual, such as information relating to the judicial investigation and the trial and, as the case may be, the ensuing conviction, is data relating to \u2018offences\u2019 and \u2018criminal convictions\u2019 within the meaning of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a08(5) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a010 of Regulation 2016/679, regardless of whether or not, in the course of those legal proceedings, the offence for which the individual was prosecuted was shown to have been committed.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, by including in the list of results displayed following a search carried out on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name links to web pages on which such data are published, the operator of a search engine carries out a processing of those data which, in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article\u00a08(5) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a010 of Regulation 2016/679, is subject to special restrictions. As the Commission observed, such processing may, by virtue of those provisions and subject to compliance with the other conditions of lawfulness laid down by that directive, be lawful in particular if appropriate and specific guarantees are provided for by national law, which may be the case where the information in question has been disclosed to the public by the public authorities in compliance with the applicable national law.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards those other conditions of lawfulness, it must be recalled that it follows from the requirements laid down in Article\u00a06(1)(c) to (e) of Directive 95/46, now repeated in Article\u00a05(1)(c) to (e) of Regulation 2016/679, that even initially lawful processing of accurate data may over time become incompatible with the directive or the regulation where those data are no longer necessary in the light of the purposes for which they were collected or processed. That is so in particular where they appear to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to those purposes and in the light of the time that has elapsed (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a093).\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as stated in paragraph\u00a066 above, even if the processing of data referred to in Article\u00a08(5) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a010 of Regulation 2016/679 does not correspond to the restrictions laid down by those provisions or the other conditions of lawfulness, such as those laid down in Article\u00a06(1)(c) to (e) of the directive and Article\u00a05(1)(c) to (e) of the regulation, the operator of a search engine must still ascertain, having regard to the reasons of substantial public interest referred to in Article\u00a08(4) of the directive or Article\u00a09(2)(g) of the regulation and in compliance with the conditions laid down in those provisions, whether the inclusion of the link to the web page in question in the list displayed following a search on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name is necessary for exercising the freedom of information of internet users potentially interested in accessing that web page by means of such a search, protected by Article\u00a011 of the Charter.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it must be recalled that it follows from the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights that applications brought by individuals for the prohibition under Article\u00a08 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed at Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950, of the making available on the internet by the various media of old reports of criminal proceedings that had been brought against them call for an examination of the fair balance to be struck between their right to respect for their private life and inter alia the public\u2019s freedom of information. In seeking that fair balance, account must be taken of the essential role played by the press in a democratic society, which includes reporting and commenting on legal proceedings. Moreover, to the media\u2019s function of communicating such information and ideas there must be added the public\u2019s right to receive them. The European Court of Human Rights acknowledged in this context that the public had an interest not only in being informed about a topical event, but also in being able to conduct research into past events, with the public\u2019s interest as regards criminal proceedings varying in degree, however, and possibly evolving over time according in particular to the circumstances of the case (ECtHR, 28\u00a0June 2018, \nM.L. and W.W. v. Germany\n, CE:ECHR:2018:0628JUD006079810, \u00a7\u00a7 89 and 100 to 102).\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is thus for the operator of a search engine to assess, in the context of a request for de-referencing relating to links to web pages on which information is published relating to criminal proceedings brought against the data subject, concerning an earlier stage of the proceedings and no longer corresponding to the current situation, whether, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, such as, in particular, the nature and seriousness of the offence in question, the progress and the outcome of the proceedings, the time elapsed, the part played by the data subject in public life and his past conduct, the public\u2019s interest at the time of the request, the content and form of the publication and the consequences of publication for the data subject, he or she has a right to the information in question no longer, in the present state of things, being linked with his or her name by a list of results displayed following a search carried out on the basis of that name.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must, however, be added that, even if the operator of a search engine were to find that that is not the case because the inclusion of the link in question is strictly necessary for reconciling the data subject\u2019s rights to privacy and protection of personal data with the freedom of information of potentially interested internet users, the operator is in any event required, at the latest on the occasion of the request for de-referencing, to adjust the list of results in such a way that the overall picture it gives the internet user reflects the current legal position, which means in particular that links to web pages containing information on that point must appear in first place on the list.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the above considerations, the answer to Question 4 is that the provisions of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0first, information relating to legal proceedings brought against an individual and, as the case may be, information relating to an ensuing conviction are data relating to \u2018offences\u2019 and \u2018criminal convictions\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a08(5) of Directive 95/46, and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0second, the operator of a search engine is required to accede to a request for de-referencing relating to links to web pages displaying such information, where the information relates to an earlier stage of the legal proceedings in question and, having regard to the progress of the proceedings, no longer corresponds to the current situation, in so far as it is established in the verification of the reasons of substantial public interest referred to in Article\u00a08(4) of Directive 95/46 that, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter override the rights of potentially interested internet users protected by Article\u00a011 of the Charter.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe provisions of Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as meaning that the prohibition or restrictions relating to the processing of special categories of personal data, mentioned in those provisions, apply also, subject to the exceptions provided for by the directive, to the operator of a search engine in the context of his responsibilities, powers and capabilities as the controller of the processing carried out in connection with the activity of the search engine, on the occasion of a verification performed by that operator, under the supervision of the competent national authorities, following a request by the data subject.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe provisions of Article\u00a08(1) and (5) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the operator of a search engine is in principle required by those provisions, subject to the exceptions provided for by the directive, to accede to requests for de-referencing in relation to links to web pages containing personal data falling within the special categories referred to by those provisions.\nArticle\u00a08(2)(e) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, pursuant to that article, such an operator may refuse to accede to a request for de-referencing if he establishes that the links at issue lead to content comprising personal data falling within the special categories referred to in Article\u00a08(1) but whose processing is covered by the exception in Article\u00a08(2)(e) of the directive, provided that the processing satisfies all the other conditions of lawfulness laid down by the directive, and unless the data subject has the right under Article\u00a014(a) of the directive to object to that processing on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation.\nThe provisions of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, where the operator of a search engine has received a request for de-referencing relating to a link to a web page on which personal data falling within the special categories referred to in Article\u00a08(1) or (5) of Directive 95/46 are published, the operator must, on the basis of all the relevant factors of the particular case and taking into account the seriousness of the interference with the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights to privacy and protection of personal data laid down in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, ascertain, having regard to the reasons of substantial public interest referred to in Article\u00a08(4) of the directive and in compliance with the conditions laid down in that provision, whether the inclusion of that link in the list of results displayed following a search on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name is strictly necessary for protecting the freedom of information of internet users potentially interested in accessing that web page by means of such a search, protected by Article\u00a011 of the Charter.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe provisions of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst, information relating to legal proceedings brought against an individual and, as the case may be, information relating to an ensuing conviction are data relating to \u2018offences\u2019 and \u2018criminal convictions\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a08(5) of Directive 95/46, and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nsecond, the operator of a search engine is required to accede to a request for de-referencing relating to links to web pages displaying such information, where the information relates to an earlier stage of the legal proceedings in question and, having regard to the progress of the proceedings, no longer corresponds to the current situation, in so far as it is established in the verification of the reasons of substantial public interest referred to in Article\u00a08(4) of Directive 95/46 that, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union override the rights of potentially interested internet users protected by Article\u00a011 of the Charter."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Member States shall lay down appropriate safeguards for personal data stored for longer periods for historical, statistical or scientific use\u2019.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 10 and 11 of the Directive set out the information with which the controller or his representative must provide a data subject, either where data relating to him are collected from him or where such data have not been collected from him.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 12 of the Directive, entitled \u2018Right of access\u2019, states as follows:\n\u2018Member States shall guarantee every data subject the right to obtain from the controller:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0without constraint, at reasonable intervals and without excessive delay or expense:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0confirmation as to whether or not data relating to him are being processed and information at least as to the purposes of the processing, the categories of data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data are disclosed,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0communication to him in an intelligible form of the data undergoing processing and of any available information as to their source,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0knowledge of the logic involved in any automatic processing of data concerning him at least in the case of the automated decisions referred to in Article 15(1);\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as appropriate the rectification, erasure or blocking of data the processing of which does not comply with the provisions of this Directive, in particular because of the incomplete or inaccurate nature of the data;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0notification to third parties to whom the data have been disclosed of any rectification, erasure or blocking carried out in compliance with (b), unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.\u2019\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 13(1) of the Directive, entitled \u2018Exemptions and restrictions\u2019, authorises Member States to derogate, inter alia, from Articles 6 to 12 thereof, if necessary to safeguard certain public interests, including national security, defence, the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences and other interests, namely, the protection of the data subject or of the rights and freedoms of others. \n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 14 of the Directive provides that Member States are to grant the data subject the right, on certain grounds, to object to the processing of data relating to him. \n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 17(1) of the Directive, Member States are to provide that the controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures which, having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation, are to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected. \n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Articles 22 and 23(1) of the Directive, Member States are to provide for the right of every person to a judicial remedy for any breach of the rights guaranteed him by the national law applicable to the processing in question and to provide that any person who has suffered damage as a result of an unlawful processing operation or of any act incompatible with the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive is entitled to receive compensation from the controller for the damage suffered. \n\u00a0\nNational legislation\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Directive was transposed into Netherlands law by a general provision, the Law on the protection of personal data (Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens). Furthermore, certain laws were adapted in order to take account of the Directive. Such is the case of the Law at issue in the main proceedings, that is to say, the Law on personal data held by local authorities (Wet gemeentelijke basisadministratie persoonsgegevens, Stb. 1994, No 494; \u2018the Wet GBA\u2019).\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 103(1) of the Wet GBA provides that, on request, the College must notify a data subject in writing, within four weeks, whether data relating to him from the local authority personal records have, in the year preceding the request, been disclosed to a purchaser or to a third party.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article 110 of the Wet GBA, the College is to retain details of any communication of data for one year following that communication, unless that communication is apparent in another form in the database.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the written observations of the College that the data held by the local authority include, in particular, the name, the date of birth, the personal identity number, the social security/tax number, the local authority of registration, the address and date of registration at the local authority, civil status, guardianship, the custody of minors, the nationality and residence permit of aliens. \n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 26 October 2005, Mr Rijkeboer requested the College to notify him of all instances in which data relating to him from the local authority personal records had, in the two years preceding the request, been disclosed to third parties. He wished to know the identity of those persons and the content of the data disclosed to them. Mr Rijkeboer, who had moved to another municipality, wished to know in particular to whom his former address had been disclosed. \n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decisions of 27 October and 29 November 2005, the College complied with that request only in part by notifying him only of the data relating to the period of one year preceding his request, by application of Article 103(1) of the Wet GBA.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Communication of the data is registered and stored in electronic form in accordance with the \u2018Logisch Ontwerp GBA\u2019 (GBA Logistical Project). This is an automated system established by the Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijkrelaties (Netherlands Ministry of the Interior and Home Affairs). It is apparent from the reference for a preliminary ruling that the data requested by Mr Rijkeboer dating from more than one year prior to his request were automatically erased, which accords with the provisions of Article 110 of the Wet GBA.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Rijkeboer lodged a complaint with the College against the refusal to give him the information relating to the recipients to whom data regarding him had been disclosed during the period before the year preceding his request. That complaint having been rejected by decision of 13 February 2006, Mr Rijkeboer brought an action before the Rechtbank Rotterdam. \n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court upheld the action, taking the view that the restriction on the right to information on provision of data to the year before the request, as provided for in Article 103(1) of the Wet GBA, is at variance with Article 12 of the Directive. It also held that the exceptions referred to in Article 13 of that directive are not applicable.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The College appealed against that decision to the Raad van State. That court finds that Article 12 of the Directive on rights of access to data does not indicate any time period within which it must be possible for those rights to be exercised. In its view, that article does not necessarily, however, preclude Member States from imposing a time restriction in their national legislation on the data subject\u2019s right to information concerning the recipients to whom personal data have been provided, but the court has doubts in that regard.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the Raad van State decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018Is the restriction, provided for in the [Netherlands] Law [on local authority personal records], on the communication of data to one year prior to the relevant request compatible with Article 12(a) of [the] Directive \u2026, whether or not read in conjunction with Article 6(1)(e) of that directive and the principle of proportionality?\u2019 \n\u00a0\nThe question referred\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be recalled at the outset that, under the system of judicial cooperation established by Article 234 EC, it is for the Court of Justice to interpret provisions of Community law. As far as concerns national provisions, under that system their interpretation is a matter for the national courts (see Case C-449/06 \nGysen\n [2008] ECR I-553, paragraph 17).\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the question referred by the national court should be understood, essentially, as seeking to determine whether, pursuant to the Directive and, in particular, to Article 12(a) thereof, an individual\u2019s right of access to information on the recipients or categories of recipient of personal data regarding him and on the content of the data communicated may be limited to a period of one year preceding his request for access. \n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court highlights two provisions of the Directive, that is to say, Article 6(1)(e) on the storage of personal data and Article 12(a) on the right of access to those data. However, neither that court nor any of the parties which submitted observations to the Court has raised the question of the exceptions set out in Article 13 of the Directive.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 6 of the Directive deals with the quality of the data. Article 6(1)(e) requires Member States to ensure that personal data are kept for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed. The data must therefore be erased when those purposes have been served.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 12(a) of the Directive provides that Member States are to guarantee data subjects a right of access to their personal data and to information on the recipients or categories of recipient of those data, without setting a time-limit.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those two articles seek, therefore, to protect the data subject. The national court wishes to know whether there is a link between those two articles in that the right of access to information on the recipients or categories of recipient of personal data and on the content of the data disclosed could depend on the length of time for which those data are stored.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The observations submitted to the Court give different points of view on the interaction between those two provisions.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The College and the Netherlands, Czech, Spanish and United Kingdom Governments submit that the right of access to information on the recipients or categories of recipients referred to in Article 12(a) of the Directive exists only in the present and not in the past. Once the data have been erased in accordance with national legislation, the data subject can no longer have access to them. That consequence does not run contrary to the Directive. \n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The College and the Netherlands Government also submit that Article 103(1) of the Wet GBA, pursuant to which the local authority is to inform a data subject, on request, of data relating to him which, in the year preceding the request, have been disclosed to recipients, goes beyond the requirements laid down in the Directive.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission and the Greek Government submit that the Directive provides for a right of access not only in the present but also for the period preceding the request for access. However, their views diverge with regard to the exact duration of that right of access.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to assess the scope of the right of access which the Directive must make possible, it is appropriate, first, to determine what data are covered by the right of access and, next, to turn to the objective of Article 12(a) examined in the light of the purposes of the Directive.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A case such as that of Mr Rijkeboer involves two categories of data.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first concerns personal data kept by the local authority on a person, such as his name and address, which constitute, in the present case, the basic data. It is apparent from the oral observations submitted by the College and the Netherlands Government that those data may be stored for a long time. They constitute \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article 2(a) of the Directive, because they represent information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n [2003] ECR I-4989, paragraph 64; Case C-101/01 \nLindqvist\n [2003] ECR I-12971, paragraph 24; and Case C-524/06 \nHuber\n [2008] ECR I-0000, paragraph 43). \n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second category concerns information on recipients or categories of recipient to whom those basic data are disclosed and on the content thereof and thus relates to the processing of the basic data. In accordance with the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, that information is stored for only one year.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The time-limit on the right of access to information on the recipient or recipients of personal data and on the content of the data disclosed, which is referred to in the main proceedings, thus concerns that second category of data.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to determine whether or not Article 12(a) of the Directive authorises such a time-limit, it is appropriate to interpret that article having regard to its objective examined in the light of the purposes of the Directive.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Article 1 of the Directive, its purpose is to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data, and thus to permit the free flow of personal data between Member States. \n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The importance of protecting privacy is highlighted in recitals 2 and 10 in the preamble to the Directive and emphasised in the case-law of the Court (see, to that effect, \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, paragraph 70; \nLindqvist\n, paragraphs 97 and 99; Case C-275/06 \nPromusicae\n [2008] ECR I-271, paragraph 63; and Case C-73/07 \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n [2008] ECR I-0000, paragraph 52).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as follows from recital 25 in the preamble to the Directive, the principles of protection must be reflected, on the one hand, in the obligations imposed on persons responsible for processing, in particular regarding data quality \u2013 the subject-matter of Article 6 of the Directive \u2013 and, on the other hand, in the right conferred on individuals, the data on whom are the subject of processing, to be informed that processing is taking place, to consult the data, to request rectification and even to object to processing in certain circumstances.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That right to privacy means that the data subject may be certain that his personal data are processed in a correct and lawful manner, that is to say, in particular, that the basic data regarding him are accurate and that they are disclosed to authorised recipients. As is stated in recital 41 in the preamble to the Directive, in order to carry out the necessary checks, the data subject must have a right of access to the data relating to him which are being processed. \n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Article 12(a) of the Directive provides for a right of access to basic data and to information on the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the data are disclosed.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That right of access is necessary to enable the data subject to exercise the rights set out in Article 12(b) and (c) of the Directive, that is to say, where the processing of his data does not comply with the provisions of the Directive, the right to have the controller rectify, erase or block his data, (paragraph (b)), or notify third parties to whom the data have been disclosed of that rectification, erasure or blocking, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort (paragraph (c)).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That right of access is also necessary to enable the data subject to exercise his right referred to in Article 14 of the Directive to object to his personal data being processed or his right of action where he suffers damage, laid down in Articles 22 and 23 thereof. \n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the right to access to information on the recipients or categories of recipient of personal data and on the content of the data disclosed, the Directive does not make it clear whether that right concerns the past and, if so, what period in the past.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, to ensure the practical effect of the provisions referred to in paragraphs 51 and 52 of the present judgment, that right must of necessity relate to the past. If that were not the case, the data subject would not be in a position effectively to exercise his right to have data presumed unlawful or incorrect rectified, erased or blocked or to bring legal proceedings and obtain compensation for the damage suffered.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A question arises as to the scope of that right in the past.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already held that the provisions of the Directive are necessarily relatively general since it has to be applied to a large number of very different situations and that the Directive includes rules with a degree of flexibility, in many instances leaving to the Member States the task of deciding the details or choosing between options (see \nLindqvist\n, paragraph 83). Thus, the Court has recognised that, in many respects, the Member States have some freedom of action in implementing the Directive (see \nLindqvist\n, paragraph 84). That freedom, which becomes apparent with regard to the transposition of Article 12(a) of the Directive, is not, however, unlimited.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The setting of a time-limit with regard to the right to access to information on the recipients or categories of recipient of personal data and on the content of the data disclosed must allow the data subject to exercise the different rights laid down in the Directive and referred to in paragraphs 51 and 52 of the present judgment.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The length of time the basic data are to be stored may constitute a useful parameter without, however, being decisive.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scope of the Directive is very wide, as the Court has already held (see \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, paragraph 43, and \nLindqvist\n, paragraph 88), and the personal data covered by the Directive are varied. The length of time such data are to be stored, defined in Article 6(1)(e) of the Directive according to the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed, can therefore differ. Where the length of time for which basic data are to be stored is very long, the data subject\u2019s interest in exercising the rights to object and to remedies referred to in paragraph 57 of the present judgment may diminish in certain cases. If, for example, the relevant recipients are numerous or there is a high frequency of disclosure to a more restricted number of recipients, the obligation to keep the information on the recipients or categories of recipient of personal data and on the content of the data disclosed for such a long period could represent an excessive burden on the controller.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Directive does not require Member States to impose such burdens on the controller.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, Article 12(c) of the Directive expressly provides for an exception to the obligation on the controller to notify third parties to whom the data have been disclosed of any correction, erasure or blocking, namely, where this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. \n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with other sections of the Directive, account may be taken of the disproportionate nature of other possible measures. With regard to the obligation to inform the data subject, recital 40 in the preamble to the Directive states that the number of data subjects and the age of the data may be taken into consideration. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 17 of the Directive concerning security of processing, Member States are to provide that the controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures which, having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation, are to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Analogous considerations are relevant with regard to the fixing of a time-limit on the right of access to information on the recipients or categories of recipient of personal data and on the content of the data disclosed. In addition to the considerations referred to in paragraph 57 of the present judgment, a number of parameters may accordingly be taken into account by the Member States, in particular applicable provisions of national law on time-limits for bringing an action, the more or less sensitive nature of the basic data, the length of time for which those data are to be stored and the number of recipients.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus it is for the Member States to fix a time-limit for storage of information on the recipients or categories of recipient of personal data and on the content of the data disclosed and to provide for access to that information which constitutes a fair balance between, on the one hand, the interest of the data subject in protecting his privacy, in particular by way of his rights to rectification, erasure and blocking of the data in the event that the processing of the data does not comply with the Directive, and rights to object and to bring legal proceedings and, on the other, the burden which the obligation to store that information represents for the controller.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, when fixing that time-limit, it is appropriate to take account also of the obligations which following from Article 6(e) of the Directive to ensure that personal data are kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, rules limiting the storage of information on the recipients or categories of recipient of personal data and on the content of the data disclosed to a period of one year and correspondingly limiting access to that information, while basic data is stored for a much longer period, do not constitute a fair balance of the interest and obligation at issue, unless it can be shown that longer storage of that information would constitute an excessive burden on the controller. It is, however, for national courts to make the verifications necessary in the light of the considerations set out in the preceding paragraphs.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the argument of some Member States that application of Articles 10 and 11 of the Directive renders superfluous a grant in respect of the past of a right to access to information on the recipients or categories of recipient referred to in Article 12(a) of the Directive cannot be accepted.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 10 and 11 impose obligations on the controller or his representative to inform the data subject, in certain circumstances, in particular of the recipients or categories of recipient of the data. The controller or his representative must communicate that information to the data subject of their own accord, inter alia when the data are collected or, if the data are not collected directly from the data subject, when the data are registered or, possibly, when the data are disclosed to a third party.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that way, those provisions are intended to impose obligations distinct from those which follow from Article 12(a) of the Directive. Consequently, they in no way reduce the obligation placed on Member States to ensure that the controller is required to give a data subject access to the information on the recipients or categories of recipient and on the data disclosed when that data subject decides to exercise his right to access conferred on him by Article 12(a). Member States must adopt measures transposing, firstly, the provisions of Articles 10 and 11 of the Directive on the obligation to provide information and, secondly, those of Article 12(a) of the Directive, without it being possible for the former to attenuate the obligations following from the latter.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the question referred must therefore be that:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 12(a) of the Directive requires Member States to ensure a right of access to information on the recipients or categories of recipient of personal data and on the content of the data disclosed not only in respect of the present but also in respect of the past. It is for Member States to fix a time-limit for storage of that information and to provide for access to that information which constitutes a fair balance between, on the one hand, the interest of the data subject in protecting his privacy, in particular by way of his rights to object and to bring legal proceedings and, on the other, the burden which the obligation to store that information represents for the controller.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rules limiting the storage of information on the recipients or categories of recipient of personal data and on the content of the data disclosed to a period of one year and correspondingly limiting access to that information, while basic data is stored for a much longer period, do not constitute a fair balance of the interest and obligation at issue, unless it can be shown that longer storage of that information would constitute an excessive burden on the controller. It is, however, for national courts to make the determinations necessary.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle 12(a) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data requires Member States to ensure a right of access to information on the recipients or categories of recipient of personal data and on the content of the data disclosed not only in respect of the present but also in respect of the past. It is for Member States to fix a time-limit for storage of that information and to provide for access to that information which constitutes a fair balance between, on the one hand, the interest of the data subject in protecting his privacy, in particular by way of his rights to object and to bring legal proceedings and, on the other, the burden which the obligation to store that information represents for the controller.\nRules limiting the storage of information on the recipients or categories of recipient of personal data and on the content of the data disclosed to a period of one year and correspondingly limiting access to that information, while basic data is stored for a much longer period, do not constitute a fair balance of the interest and obligation at issue, unless it can be shown that longer storage of that information would constitute an excessive burden on the controller. It is, however, for national courts to make the determinations necessary."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Directive 97/66/EC has to be adapted to developments in the markets and technologies for electronic communications services in order to provide an equal level of protection of personal data and privacy for users of publicly available electronic communications services, regardless of the technologies used. That Directive should therefore be repealed and replaced by this Directive.\n\u2026\n(40)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Safeguards should be provided for subscribers against intrusion of their privacy by unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes in particular by means of automated calling machines, telefaxes, and emails, including SMS messages. These forms of unsolicited commercial communications may on the one hand be relatively easy and cheap to send and on the other may impose a burden and/or cost on the recipient. Moreover, in some cases their volume may also cause difficulties for electronic communications networks and terminal equipment. For such forms of unsolicited communications for direct marketing, it is justified to require that prior explicit consent of the recipients is obtained before such communications are addressed to them. The single market requires a harmonised approach to ensure simple, [European Union-wide] rules for businesses and users.\u2019\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01(1) of that directive provides:\n\u2018This Directive provides for the harmonisation of the national provisions required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy and confidentiality, with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic communication sector and to ensure the free movement of such data and of electronic communication equipment and services in the [European Union].\u2019\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a02(d), (f) and (h), of the directive, entitled \u2018Definitions\u2019:\n\u2018The following definitions shall also apply:\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201ccommunication\u201d means any information exchanged or conveyed between a finite number of parties by means of a publicly available electronic communications service.

At the request of eprimo, Interactive Media CCSP, an advertising agency, inserted advertisements into the email inboxes of users of the T-Online free email service. That service is funded by advertising paid for by advertisers and provided free to users.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those advertisements appeared in the private email inboxes of those users, specifically in the section in which incoming emails are listed, and were inserted between the emails received.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those users thus received, on 12\u00a0December 2016, 13\u00a0January 2017 and 15\u00a0January 2017, advertising messages in their inboxes. Entries appeared therein which were not visually distinguishable in the list from other emails in the user\u2019s account except for the fact that: (i) the date was replaced by the word \u2018\nAnzeige\n\u2019 (advertisement),\n(ii) no sender was mentioned and (iii) the text appeared against a grey background. The \u2018subject\u2019 section corresponding to that entry in the list contained text intended to promote advantageous prices for electricity and gas services.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From a technical point of view, a JavaScript code of an advertising server (TAG) is connected with the place in question in the inbox on the internet page consulted by the user of such an email inbox. For that reason, when a user opens the internet page, a request \n(Adrequest)\n is sent to the advertising server in order to randomly select an advertising banner from a basket constituted by advertisers and transmit it, such that it appears in the user\u2019s inbox. If the user clicks on the advertisement displayed, the input is conveyed to the advertising server, which records it and redirects the browser to the advertiser\u2019s website.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The functionality of the T-Online email service treats the insertion of the advertising messages in question into users\u2019 inboxes differently from ordinary emails: the advertising message, which appears in the form of an email, may be deleted from the list, but may not be archived, altered or forwarded, and it is not possible to reply to it. Finally, the advertising message is not counted amongst the total number of emails in the inbox, and nor does it take up storage space.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0StWL considered that that advertising practice involving the use of email without the recipient\u2019s express prior consent was contrary to the rules of unfair competition in that it constituted an \u2018unacceptable nuisance\u2019 within the meaning of Paragraph\u00a07(2)(3) of the UWG and that it was misleading, within the meaning of Paragraph\u00a05a(6) of the UWG. On that basis, StWL commenced an action to desist against eprimo before the Landgericht N\u00fcrnberg-F\u00fcrth (Regional Court, Nuremberg-F\u00fcrth, Germany). That court upheld StWL\u2019s application and ordered eprimo, on pain of a fine, to cease disseminating, to final consumers, such advertising relating to the supply of electricity via the T-online.de email account.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On an appeal brought by eprimo before the Oberlandesgericht N\u00fcrnberg (Higher Regional Court, Nuremberg, Germany), that court considered that the contested placement of advertising in the T-Online private email inbox did not constitute an unlawful commercial practice under competition law.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, according to that court, first, the defendant\u2019s advertising was not an unacceptable nuisance involving the use of \u2018electronic mail\u2019, within the meaning of Paragraph\u00a07(2)(3) of the UWG since that advertising could not be regarded as an \u2018electronic mail\u2019, within the meaning of that provision. In any event, the advertising at issue did not entail, for the user of the T-Online email service, any charges or costs greater than the \u2018normal\u2019 nuisance occasioned by any advertising and did not therefore cause an \u2018unacceptable nuisance\u2019 within the meaning of the general provision contained in the first sentence of Paragraph\u00a07(1) of the UWG, in particular having regard to the fact that the email service was provided free of charge.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, that court found that the advertising at issue was not unlawful under Paragraph\u00a07(2)(4)(a) of the UWG, since it was not advertising in the form of messages. Paragraph\u00a07(2)(1) of the UWG was also inapplicable, since it presupposes \u2018solicitation\u2019, in the sense of \u2018conduct inconveniencing\u2019 a consumer, which was lacking in the present case. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s advertisements, which did not conceal the fact that they were advertisements, could not be considered to be unfair on the ground that they were misleading, within the meaning of Paragraph\u00a05a(6) of the UWG.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing an appeal on a point of law brought before it by StWL, the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice, Germany) considers that the success of the appeal depends on the interpretation of Article\u00a02(d) and (h) and Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58 and of Annex\u00a0I, point\u00a026, to Directive 2005/29.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, the conduct for which eprimo is criticised may be unlawful under Paragraph\u00a07(2)(3) of the UWG, which transposes Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58. It states that it is also possible that the advertising is unlawful under Paragraph\u00a07(2)(1) of the UWG, which transposes point\u00a026 of Annex\u00a0I to Directive 2005/29.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring court seeks clarification from the Court of Justice regarding the criteria governing the concept of \u2018electronic mail\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 2002/58 and the concept of \u2018use\u2019 of the latter for the purposes of direct marketing within the meaning of Article\u00a013(1) thereof. In addition, the referring court asks the Court to specify the criteria for \u2018solicitation\u2019, within the meaning of point\u00a026 of Annex\u00a0I to Directive 2005/29.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) decided to stay the proceedings and refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the concept of \u201csending\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a02(h) of Directive [2002/58] cover a situation in which a message is not transmitted by a user of an electronic communications service, via a service provider, to the electronic \u201caddress\u201d of a second user, but, as a consequence of the opening of the password-protected internet page of an email account, is automatically displayed by ad servers in certain areas designated for that purpose in the email inbox of a randomly selected user (inbox advertising)?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the collection of a message within the meaning of Article\u00a02(h) of Directive [2002/58] presuppose that, after becoming aware of the existence of a message, the recipient triggers the programmatically prescribed transmission of the message data by making an intentional collection request, or is it sufficient for the appearance of a message in an email account inbox to be triggered by the user opening the password-protected internet page of his or her e-mail account?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does a message, which is not sent to an individual recipient already specifically identified prior to transmission but is inserted into the inbox of a randomly selected user, constitute an electronic mail within the meaning of Article\u00a013(1) of Directive [2002/58]?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is electronic mail used for the purposes of direct marketing, within the meaning of Article\u00a013(1) of Directive [2002/58], only where the user is found to be the subject of a burden that is greater than a nuisance?\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does individual advertising meet the conditions governing the presence of \u201csolicitation\u201d, for the purposes of the first sentence of point\u00a026 of Annex\u00a0I to Directive [2005/29], only where a customer is contacted via a medium traditionally used for individual communication between a sender and a recipient, or is it sufficient if\u00a0\u2013 as with the advertisement at issue in the present case\u00a0\u2013 an individual connection is established by the fact that the advertisement is displayed in the inbox of a private email account, and thus in a section in which the customer expects to find messages addressed to him or her personally?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first to fourth questions\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first to fourth questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, first, whether Article\u00a02(h) and Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58 must be interpreted as meaning that the criteria governing the concept of \u2018electronic mail\u2019, within the meaning of those provisions, are met when an advertising message displayed following the opening of the internet page, which is protected by a password, corresponding to an email account, in certain spaces allocated for that purpose in the electronic inbox of a user selected at random; and, second, whether Article\u00a013(1) of that directive must be interpreted as meaning that such an advertising activity falls within the concept of \u2018use of\u00a0\u2026 electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, which requires that the user of the email service concerned has given his or her prior consent to such activity, only if the user is found to be the subject of a burden that is greater than a nuisance.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to reply to those questions, it should be borne in mind that, under Article\u00a01(1) thereof, Directive 2002/58 provides, inter alia, for the harmonisation of the national provisions required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy and confidentiality, with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As recital\u00a040 thereof states, that directive intends safeguards to be provided for subscribers against intrusion of their privacy by unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes in particular by means of automated calling machines, telefaxes, and emails, including SMS messages.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 2002/58 lays down a broad definition of the concept of \u2018communication\u2019 that includes any information exchanged or conveyed between a finite number of parties by means of a publicly available electronic communications service.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Article\u00a013(1) of that directive, entitled \u2018Unsolicited communications\u2019 allows the use of various types of communication, namely automated calling machines without human intervention (automatic calling machines), facsimile machines, and emails, for the purposes of direct marketing, on the condition that they target subscribers or users who have given their prior consent.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to apply that provision, it is necessary therefore to ascertain, in the first place, whether the type of communication used for those direct marketing purposes is amongst those covered by that provision; in the second place, whether such a communication has the purpose of direct marketing; and, in the third place, whether the requirement to obtain prior consent from the user has been complied with.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the first place, the means of electronic communication through which direct marketing is conducted, it should be noted, at the outset, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a053 of his Opinion, that the list of means of communication referred to in recital\u00a040 and in Article\u00a013(1) of that directive is not exhaustive.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Directive 2009/136, which amended Directive 2002/58, refers, in recital\u00a067 thereof, to kinds of communication other than those mentioned in Directive 2002/58 when it states that the safeguards provided for subscribers against intrusion into their privacy by unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes by means of electronic mail \u2018should also be applicable to SMS, MMS and other kinds of similar applications\u2019. \nSecond, as specified in recital\u00a04 of Directive 2002/58, the objective of providing an equal level of protection of personal data and privacy for users of publicly available electronic communications services must be ensured \u2018regardless of the technologies used\u2019, which confirms that it is necessary to adopt an interpretation that is broad, and evolving from a technological perspective, of the types of communication covered by that directive.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having made those observations, it must be held that, in the present case, the advertising message at issue in the main proceedings was distributed to the persons concerned using a means of communication expressly referred to in Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58, namely electronic mail.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, from the recipient\u2019s point of view, the advertising message is displayed in the user\u2019s email inbox, namely in a space normally reserved for private emails. The user is only able to free that space in order to obtain a view of all of his or her exclusively private emails after having checked the content of that advertising message, and only after having actively deleted it. If the user clicks on an advertising message, such as the one at issue in the main proceedings, he or she is redirected to an internet site containing the advertising in question, rather than continuing with the reading of his or her private emails.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, by contrast with advertising banners or pop-up windows, which are displayed at the edges of, or separately from, the list of private messages, the appearance of the advertising messages at issue in the main proceedings within the list of the user\u2019s private emails, impedes access to those emails in a manner similar to that used for unsolicited emails (also known as \u2018spam\u2019) to the extent that such a method requires the same decision to be taken by the subscriber concerning the processing of those messages.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a055 of his Opinion, since the advertising messages occupy lines in the inbox that are normally designated for private emails and because of their similarity to the latter, there is a likelihood of confusion between those two categories of messages that may cause a user who clicks on the line corresponding to the advertising message to be redirected unintentionally to a website offering the advertisement at issue instead of continuing to access his or her private emails.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, as the Commission observed, if advertising entries of any kind are displayed in the inbox of an internet email account, namely in the section in which all of the emails addressed to the user are displayed, that email inbox must be regarded as constituting a means by which the advertising messages concerned are communicated to that user, which involves the use of his or her email for the purposes of direct marketing, within the meaning of Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58. In other words, the defendant and the intervener in the main proceedings, and also the email service provider involved, use the existence of the list of private emails, taking into account the particular interest and trust of the subscriber with regard to that list, to place their direct advertising, giving it the appearance of a real email.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proceeding in that manner constitutes a use of electronic mail, within the meaning of Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58, likely to breach the objective, pursued by that provision, of protecting users from any intrusion into their private life by unsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the question of whether advertising messages such as those at issue in the main proceedings themselves fulfil the criteria to be classified as \u2018electronic mail\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(h) of that directive, becomes superfluous in so far as those messages are communicated to the users concerned by means of their email inbox and thus their electronic mail.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the second place, the question of whether communications covered by Article\u00a013(1) of that directive are made for the purpose of direct marketing, it must be ascertained whether such a communication pursues a commercial purpose and is addressed directly and individually to a consumer.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the very nature of the advertising messages at issue in the main proceedings, which promote services, and the fact that they are distributed in the form of an email such that they are directly displayed in the inbox of the private email service of the user concerned, allows those messages to be classified as communications for the purposes of direct marketing, within the meaning of Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that the recipient of those advertising messages is chosen at random, which is raised as part of the third question posed by the referring court, cannot call that conclusion into question.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it suffices to observe, as the Advocate General has done in point\u00a061 of his Opinion, that the random or predefined selection of the recipient is not one of the conditions for the application of Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58. In other words, it is irrelevant whether the advertising at issue is addressed to a predetermined and individually identified recipient or is sent on a mass, random basis to multiple recipients. What matters is that there is a communication for a commercial purpose, which reaches, directly and individually, one or more email service users by being inserted in the inboxes of those users\u2019 email accounts.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The recipients of such advertising messages are individual, inter alia, in their capacity as users of a provider\u2019s individual email service in so far as the user obtains access to his or her inbox only after having entered his or her registration data and password. Consequently, the display occurs following that authentication procedure by the user in a private space reserved to him or her and which is intended for the consultation of private content, in the form of emails.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, as regards specifically the requirement to obtain prior consent, laid down in Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58, it must be recalled that a communication which falls within the field of application of that provision is allowed, on condition that its recipient has given prior consent.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, it is clear from Article\u00a02(f) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a094(2) of Regulation 2016/679, that such consent must meet the requirements under Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 or Article\u00a04(11) of that regulation, depending on which of those two rules is applicable \nratione temporis\n to the facts at issue in the main proceedings.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46, defines the term \u2018consent\u2019 as meaning \u2018any freely given specific and informed indication of his [or her] wishes by which the data subject signifies his [or her] agreement to personal data relating to him [or her] being processed\u2019.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That same requirement also applies in the context of Regulation 2016/679. Indeed, Article\u00a04(11) of that regulation defines the \u2018consent of the data subject\u2019 as meaning that it requires a \u2018freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous\u2019 indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes in the form of a statement or by \u2018a clear affirmative action\u2019 signifying agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case of an action to bring about the end of an illicit commercial practice, such as the case at issue in the main proceedings, it is not inconceivable that, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a050 of his Opinion, supposing the proceedings brought by StWL seek an order that eprimo refrain from future action, Regulation 2016/679 would be applicable \nratione temporis\n to the dispute in the main proceedings although the facts giving rise to that dispute occurred prior to 25\u00a0May 2018, the date on which that regulation became applicable, since Directive 95/46 was repealed with effect from that date.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that such consent must be indicated, at least, in a manifestation of a free, specific and informed wish on the part of the person concerned (\u2018the data subject\u2019).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is clear from the case file submitted to the Court that, during the registration process for the email address at issue in the main proceedings, the T-Online email service is offered to users in the form of two categories of email services, namely, first, a free email service funded by advertising and, second, a paid-for email service, without advertising. Thus, users who choose the free service, as in the case in the main proceedings, accept that they will receive advertisements in order not to pay any consideration in exchange for the use of that email service.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is however for the referring court to determine whether the user concerned, having opted for the free T-Online email service, was duly informed of precise means of distribution of such advertising and in fact consented to receiving advertising messages such as those at issue in the main proceedings. In particular, it is necessary for that court to be satisfied, first, that that user was clearly and precisely informed in particular of the fact that advertising messages are displayed within the list of private emails received and, second, that he or she specifically and on a fully informed basis, indicated his or her consent to receive such advertising messages (see, to that effect, judgment of 11\u00a0November 2020, \nOrange Romania\n, C-61/19, EU:C:2020:901, paragraph\u00a052).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, in response to the fourth question by which the referring court asks whether, in order for advertising such as that at issue in the main proceedings to be classified as \u2018use of\u00a0\u2026 electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58, it is necessary to find that the burden to which the user is subject is greater than a nuisance, it must be held that the directive does not require such a test to be met.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a062 of his Opinion, it is clear from recital\u00a040 of that directive that the requirement to obtain prior consent laid down in that provision stems, in particular, from the fact that unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes may \u2018impose a burden and/or cost on the recipient\u2019. Since such communications fall within the scope of Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58, it is not therefore necessary to ascertain whether the resulting burden for the recipient is greater than a nuisance.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is moreover common ground that advertising activity such as that at issue in the main proceedings does indeed impose a burden on the user concerned to the extent that, as has been observed in paragraph\u00a042 of this judgment, the appearance of advertising messages within the list of the user\u2019s private emails in a manner similar to that used for unsolicited emails (spam), requires the same decisions to be taken by the subscriber as regards the processing of those messages.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first to fourth questions is that Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58 must be interpreted as meaning that the display, in the inbox of an electronic mail service user, of advertising messages in a form similar to that of real emails, and placed in the same position as those emails, without the fact that recipients are randomly determined or an assessment of the level of intensity and burden imposed on that user being relevant in that regard, constitutes \u2018use of\u00a0\u2026 electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing\u2019, such use being allowed only on the condition that the user was clearly and specifically informed of the distribution methods of such advertising, including within the list of private emails received, and indicated his or her specific and fully informed consent to receive such messages.\n\u00a0\nThe fifth question\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fifth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Annex\u00a0I, point\u00a026, to Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that an activity consisting of the display in the inbox of an email service user of advertising messages in a form similar to that of real emails, and placed in the same position as those emails, falls within the concept of \u2018persistent and unwanted solicitations\u2019 of users of email services, within the meaning of that provision.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a05 of that directive prohibits, in paragraph\u00a01 thereof, unfair commercial practices and lays down, in paragraph\u00a02, the criteria for determining whether a commercial practice is unfair.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a05(4) of that directive provides, in particular, that commercial practices which are \u2018misleading\u2019, within the meaning of Articles\u00a06 and 7 of Directive 2005/29, and those which are \u2018aggressive\u2019 within the meaning of Articles\u00a08 and 9 of that directive, are unfair.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that Directive 2005/29 carries out a complete harmonisation at EU level of the rules relating to unfair commercial practices of undertakings vis-\u00e0-vis consumers and establishes, in Annex\u00a0I thereto, an exhaustive list of 31 commercial practices which, in accordance with Article\u00a05(5) of that directive, are regarded as unfair \u2018in all circumstances\u2019. Consequently, as recital\u00a017 of that directive expressly states, these commercial practices alone can be deemed to be unfair in themselves without a case-by-case assessment pursuant to the provisions of Articles\u00a05 to 9 of that directive (judgment of 2\u00a0September 2021, \nPeek & Cloppenburg\n, C-371/20, EU:C:2021:674, paragraph\u00a034 and the case-law cited).\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, pursuant to Annex\u00a0I, point\u00a026, to Directive 2005/29, \u2018commercial practices which shall be regarded as unfair in all circumstances\u2019 covers, as an aggressive commercial practice, a professional \u2018making persistent and unwanted solicitations by telephone, fax, email or other remote media except in circumstances and to the extent justified under national law to enforce a contractual obligation\u2019.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As has been observed in paragraphs\u00a048, 50 and 51 of this judgment, an advertising message, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, must be regarded as addressing the user concerned directly and individually to the extent that, since it is distributed in the form of an email, it appears directly within the inbox of the private email of the user concerned, within a private space protected by a password, which is reserved to that user and where he or she expects to receive only messages addressed to him or her individually.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For that reason, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a071 of his Opinion, the effect of that message is therefore similar to that of individual direct marketing, whether or not the advertiser has singled out that specific recipient during the technical preparation of the message in question and whether or not that message is processed differently from emails in terms of storage space and functionalities connected with the processing of a real electronic mail.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it must be held that such an advertising message constitutes a \u2018solicitation\u2019 of email service users, within the meaning of Annex\u00a0I, point\u00a026, to Directive 2005/29.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, it is necessary next to ascertain whether such a solicitation is \u2018persistent and unwanted\u2019 such that it must be prohibited in all circumstances under that provision.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is necessary to observe, first, that, as recalled in paragraph\u00a021 of this judgment, the users concerned received advertising messages in their private email inboxes on three occasions, namely 12\u00a0December 2016, 13\u00a0January 2017 and 15\u00a0January 2017 respectively. In those circumstances, such a solicitation, taking into account also its frequency within a limited period of time, must be regarded as being \u2018persistent\u2019 within the meaning of Annex\u00a0I, point\u00a026, to Directive 2005/29, as the referring court found.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as regards whether such an advertising activity is \u2018unwanted\u2019, within the meaning of the same point\u00a026, it is necessary to ascertain whether the display of an advertising message such as that at issue in the main proceedings meets that condition having regard to whether or not consent was given by that user prior to that display and whether that user expressed any opposition to such an advertising practice. Such opposition is furthermore established in the case in the main proceedings, as the referring court found.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the fifth question is that Annex\u00a0I, point\u00a026, to Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that an activity consisting of the display in the inbox of an email service user of advertising messages in a form similar to that of real emails, and placed in the same position as those emails, falls within the concept of \u2018persistent and unwanted solicitations\u2019 of users of email services, within the meaning of that provision, if the display of those advertising messages is, first, sufficiently frequent and regular to be classified as \u2018persistent solicitations\u2019 and, second, may be classified as \u2018unwanted solicitations\u2019 in the absence of consent having been given by that user prior to that display.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a013(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009, must be interpreted as meaning that the display, in the inbox of an electronic mail service user, of advertising messages in a form similar to that of real emails, and placed in the same position as those emails, without the fact that recipients are randomly determined or an assessment of the level of intensity and burden imposed on that user being relevant in that regard, constitutes \u2018use of\u00a0\u2026 electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing\u2019, which is permitted only on the condition that the user was clearly and specifically informed of the distribution methods of such advertising, including within the list of private emails received, and the user indicated specific and fully informed consent to receive such messages.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnnex\u00a0I, point\u00a026, to Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11\u00a0May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No\u00a02006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (\u2018Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\u2019), must be interpreted as meaning that an activity consisting of the display in the inbox of an email service user of advertising messages in a form similar to that of real emails, and placed in the same position as those emails, falls within the concept of \u2018persistent and unwanted solicitations\u2019 of users of email services, within the meaning of that provision, if the display of those advertising messages is, first, sufficiently frequent and regular to be classified as \u2018persistent solicitations\u2019 and, second, may be classified as \u2018unwanted solicitations\u2019 in the absence of consent having been given by that user prior to that display."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 5 Apr 2022, C-140/20 (\nCommissioner of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na

of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ 2002 L\u00a0201, p.\u00a037), as amended by Directive

between G.D. and the Commissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Commissioner of the national police force, Ireland), the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Ireland) and the Attorney General, concerning the validity of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 (\u2018the 2011 Act\u2019).\n\u00a0\nLegal context\n\u00a0\nEuropean Union

Therefore it does not alter the existing balance between the individual\u2019s right to privacy and the possibility for Member States to take the measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of this Directive, necessary for the protection of public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the activities relate to State security matters) and the enforcement of criminal law. Consequently, this Directive does not affect the ability of Member States to carry out lawful interception of electronic communications, or take other measures, if necessary for any of these purposes and in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms[, signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950], as interpreted by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.

In particular, point\u00a06 of Part\u00a01 of Schedule\u00a02 provides for the retention of data necessary to identify the location of mobile communication equipment, those data being, first, the identity of the cell (\u2018cell ID\u2019) and, second, data identifying the geographical location of cells by reference to their cell ID during the period for which communication data are retained.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schedule\u00a02, Part\u00a02, to the 2011 Act covers data relating to internet access, internet email and internet telephony and includes, inter alia, the user identification number (\u2018user ID\u2019) and telephone number, the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the date, time and duration of a communication. The content of communications does not fall within this type of data.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under sections\u00a04 and 5 of the 2011 Act, service providers must take specified measures to ensure that data are protected against unauthorised access.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section\u00a06 of the 2011 Act, which lays down the conditions under which a disclosure request may be made, provides in paragraph\u00a01:\n\u2018A member of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na not below the rank of chief superintendent may request a service provider to disclose to that member data retained by the service provider in accordance with section\u00a03 where that member is satisfied that the data are required for\u2014\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of a serious offence,\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the safeguarding of the security of the State,\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the saving of human life.\u2019\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section\u00a07 of the 2011 Act requires service providers to comply with disclosure requests referred to in section\u00a06 thereof.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of reviewing the decision of the member of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na referred to in section\u00a06 of the 2011 Act, a complaint procedure is provided for in section\u00a010 thereof and a procedure before the designated judge, within the meaning of section\u00a012 thereof, who is responsible for examining the application of the provisions of that act.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In March 2015, G.D. was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a person who disappeared in August 2012 and whose remains were not discovered until September 2013. In the appeal against his conviction, G.D. criticised the first-instance court in particular for having incorrectly admitted as evidence traffic and location data relating to telephone calls, on the ground that the 2011 Act, which governed the retention of that data and on the basis of which the police carrying out the investigation had obtained access to those data, infringed rights conferred on him by EU law. That appeal is currently pending.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to be able to contest, as part of the criminal proceedings, the admissibility of that evidence, G.D. brought civil proceedings before the High Court (Ireland) seeking a declaration that some of the provisions of the 2011 Act are invalid. By decision of 6\u00a0December 2018, that court upheld G.D.\u2019s submission and held that section\u00a06(1)(a) of that act was incompatible with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter. Ireland appealed against that decision to the Supreme Court (Ireland), which is the referring court.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The criminal proceedings pending before the Court of Appeal (Ireland) were stayed until the delivery of the referring court\u2019s decision in the main civil proceedings.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the referring court, Ireland submitted that, in order to determine whether interference with the right to private life enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter as a result of the retention of traffic and location data under the 2011 Act is proportionate, it is necessary to examine the objectives of the regime established by that law as a whole. In addition, according to that Member State, that act established a detailed framework governing access to retained data by virtue of which the section responsible, within the national police force, for the prior examination of requests for access was functionally independent from the national police in the conduct of its duties and, therefore, satisfied the requirement for a prior review to be carried out by an independent administrative entity. That system of review is complemented by a complaints procedure and by judicial review. Finally, that Member State submits that, if the 2011 Act is ultimately held to be inconsistent with EU law, the temporal effect of any declaration which the referring court makes as a result should be prospective only.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For his part, G.D. submits that the system of general and indiscriminate retention of data established by the 2011 Act and the regime for access to those data provided for by that law are incompatible with EU law as interpreted, in particular, by the Court in paragraph\u00a0120 of the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others \n(C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970).\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states, as a preliminary matter, that it is for it to determine only whether the High Court was correct in law to hold that section\u00a06(1)(a) of the 2011 Act was incompatible with EU law and that, by contrast, the question of the admissibility of the evidence submitted in the context of the criminal proceedings falls within jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal which is seised of the appeal brought against the conviction.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the referring court has doubts, first of all, as to the requirements of EU law as regards the retention of data for the purposes of combating serious crime. In that regard, it considers, in essence, that only the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data allows serious crime to be combated effectively, which the targeted and expedited retention (\nquick freeze\n) of data does not make possible. As regards targeted retention, the referring court wonders whether it is possible to target specific groups or geographic areas for the purposes of combating serious crimes, since some serious crimes rarely involve circumstances known to the competent national authorities enabling them to suspect the commission of an offence in advance. In addition, targeted retention could give rise to discrimination. As for expedited retention, the referring court considers that that is only useful in situations where it is possible to identify a suspect in the very early stages of an investigation.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, next, access to data retained by providers of electronic communications services, the referring court explains that the national police force established, within its organisation, a system of self-certification of requests addressed to those service providers. Thus, it is clear from the evidence produced before the High Court that the Commissioner of the national police force decided, by an internal measure, that the requests for access made pursuant to the 2011 Act must be dealt with in a centralised manner, by a single national police officer of the rank of Chief Superintendent, namely the head of the security and intelligence section. If that official considers that the data concerned are necessary for the purposes, inter alia, of the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of a serious offence, he or she may address a request for access to the providers of electronic communications services. In addition, the Commissioner of the national police force established, within the police force, an independent unit entitled the Telecommunications Liaison Unit (\u2018the TLU\u2019) in order to provide support to the head of the security and intelligence section in the exercise of his or her duties and to serve as a single point of contact with those service providers.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court adds that, during the period concerned by the criminal investigation brought against G.D., all the requests for access were required to be approved in the first place by a superintendent or inspector acting in that capacity, before they were sent to the TLU to be processed, and that the investigators were directed to include sufficient detail in their requests for access so that an informed decision could be taken. In addition, the TLU and the head of the security and intelligence section were required to examine the legality, necessity and proportionality of requests for access, taking into account the fact that that head could be called upon to answer for his or her decision before the judge designated by the High Court. Furthermore, the TLU is also subject to audit by the Data Protection Commissioner (Ireland).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the referring court is uncertain as to the scope and temporal effects of a possible declaration of incompatibility of the 2011 Act with EU law. In that regard, it states that such a declaration could only be applied prospectively on the ground the data used as evidence in the criminal proceedings against G.D. were the subject of retention and access at the end of 2013, namely in a period during which Ireland was required to apply the provisions of the 2011 Act transposing Directive 2006/24. According to Ireland, that solution would also be appropriate since, otherwise, the investigation and prosecution of serious offences in Ireland, and the situation of persons already tried and convicted could be seriously impacted.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was in those circumstances that the Supreme Court decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is a general/universal data retention regime\u00a0\u2013 even subject to stringent restrictions on retention and access\u00a0\u2013 \nper se\n contrary to the provisions of Article\u00a015 of Directive [2002/58], interpreted in the light of the Charter?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In considering whether to grant a declaration of inconsistency of a national measure implemented pursuant to Directive [2006/24], and making provision for a general data retention regime (subject to the necessary stringent controls on retention and/or in relation to access), and in particular in assessing the proportionality of any such regime, is a national court entitled to have regard to the fact that data may be retained lawfully by service providers for their own commercial purposes, and may be required to be retained for reasons of national security excluded from the provisions of Directive [2002/58]?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In assessing, in the context of determining the compatibility with [EU] law and in particular with Charter Rights of a national measure for access to retained data, what criteria should a national court apply in considering whether any such access regime provides the required independent prior scrutiny as determined by the Court of Justice in its case-law? In that context, can a national court, in making such an assessment, have any regard to the existence of ex post judicial or independent scrutiny?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, is a national court obliged to declare the inconsistency of a national measure with the provisions of Article\u00a015 of [Directive 2002/58], if the national measure makes provision for a general data retention regime for the purpose of combating serious crime, and where the national court has concluded, on all the evidence available, that such retention is both essential and strictly necessary to the achievement of the objective of combating serious crime?\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If a national court is obliged to conclude that a national measure is inconsistent with the provisions of Article\u00a015 of Directive [2002/58], as interpreted in the light of the Charter, is it entitled to limit the temporal effect of any such declaration, if satisfied that a failure to do so would lead to \u201cresultant chaos and damage to the public interest\u201d (in line with the approach taken, for example, in \nR (National Council for Civil Liberties) v Secretary of State for Home Department and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs \n[2018] EWHC 975, at paragraph\u00a046)?\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May a national court invited to declare the inconsistency of national legislation with Article\u00a015 of [Directive 2002/58], and/or to disapply this legislation, and/or to declare that the application of such legislation had breached the rights of an individual, either in the context of proceedings commenced in order to facilitate an argument in respect of the admissibility of evidence in criminal proceedings or otherwise, be permitted to refuse such relief in respect of data retained pursuant to the national provision enacted pursuant to the obligation under Article\u00a0288 TFEU to faithfully introduce into national law the provisions of a directive, or to limit any such declaration to the period after the declaration of invalidity of [Directive 2006/24] issued by the [judgment of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n (C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238)]?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first, second and fourth questions\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first, second and fourth question, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8, 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that provides for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data for the purposes of combating serious crime.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted, as a preliminary point, that it is settled case-law that, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary not only to refer to its wording but also to consider its context and the objectives of the legislation of which it forms part, and in particular the origin of that legislation (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0105 and the case-law cited).\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from the wording itself of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 that the legislative measures that it authorises Member States to take, under the conditions that it lays down, may seek only \u2018to restrict the scope\u2019 of the rights and obligations laid down inter alia in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the system established by that directive of which Article\u00a015(1) forms part, it must be recalled that, pursuant to the first and second sentences of Article\u00a05(1) of that directive, Member States are required to ensure, through their national legislation, the confidentiality of communications by means of a public communications network and publicly available electronic communications services, as well as of the related traffic data. In particular, they are required to prohibit listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communications and the related traffic data by persons other than users, without the consent of the users concerned, except when legally authorised to do so in accordance with Article\u00a015(1) of the same directive.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court has already held that Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2002/58 enshrines the principle of confidentiality of both electronic communications and the related traffic data and requires inter alia that, in principle, persons other than users be prohibited from storing, without those users\u2019 consent, those communications and data (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0107).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That provision reflects the objective pursued by the EU legislature when adopting Directive 2002/58. It is apparent from the Explanatory Memorandum of the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (COM(2000) 385 final), which gave rise to Directive 2002/58, that the EU legislature sought to \u2018ensure that a high level of protection of personal data and privacy will continue to be guaranteed for all electronic communications services regardless of the technology used\u2019. As is apparent from, inter alia, recitals\u00a06 and 7 thereof, the purpose of that directive is to protect users of electronic communications services from risks for their personal data and privacy resulting from new technologies and, in particular, from the increasing capacity for automated storage and processing of data. In particular, as stated in recital\u00a02 of the directive, the EU legislature\u2019s intent is to ensure full respect for the rights set out in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgments of 21\u00a0December 2016,\n Tele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a083, and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0106).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In adopting Directive 2002/58, the EU legislature gave concrete expression to those rights, so that the users of electronic communications services are entitled to expect, in principle, that their communications and data relating thereto will remain anonymous and may not be recorded, unless they have agreed otherwise (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0109).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the processing and storage by electronic communications service providers of subscribers\u2019 and users\u2019 traffic data, Article\u00a06 of Directive 2002/58 provides, in paragraph\u00a01, that those data must be erased or made anonymous when they are no longer needed for the purpose of the transmission of a communication, and states, in paragraph\u00a02, that the traffic data necessary for the purposes of subscriber billing and interconnection fees may only be processed up to the end of the period during which the bill may lawfully be challenged or payments pursued in order to obtain payment. As regards location data other than traffic data, Article\u00a09(1) of that directive provides that those data may be processed only subject to certain conditions and after they have been made anonymous or the consent of the users or subscribers obtained.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, Directive 2002/58 does not merely create a framework for access to such data through safeguards to prevent abuse, but also enshrines, in particular, the principle of the prohibition of their storage by third parties.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 permits Member States to adopt legislative measures that \u2018restrict the scope\u2019 of the rights and obligations laid down inter alia in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of that directive, such as those arising from the principles of confidentiality of communications and the prohibition on storing related data recalled in paragraph\u00a035 of this judgment, that provision provides for an exception to the general rule provided for inter alia in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 and must thus, in accordance with settled case-law, be the subject of a strict interpretation. That provision, therefore, cannot permit the exception to the obligation of principle to ensure the confidentiality of electronic communications and data relating thereto and, in particular, to the prohibition on storage of that data, laid down in Article\u00a05 of that directive, to become the rule, if the latter provision is not to be rendered largely meaningless (see, to that effect, judgments of 21\u00a0December 2016,\n Tele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a089, and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0111).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objectives that are capable of justifying a limitation of the rights and obligations laid down, in particular, in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58, the Court has previously held that the list of objectives set out in the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of that directive is exhaustive, as a result of which a legislative measure adopted under that provision must correspond, genuinely and strictly, to one of those objectives (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0112 and the case-law cited).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it is clear from the third sentence in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 that measures taken by the Member States must comply with the general principles of EU law, which include the principle of proportionality, and ensure respect for the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter. In that regard, the Court has previously held that the obligation imposed on providers of electronic communications services by a Member State by way of national legislation to retain traffic data for the purpose of making them available, if necessary, to the competent national authorities raises issues relating to compatibility not only with Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, relating to the protection of privacy and to the protection of personal data, respectively, but also with Article\u00a011 of the Charter, relating to the freedom of expression (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0113 and the case-law cited).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the interpretation of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 must take account of the importance both of the right to privacy, guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, and of the right to protection of personal data, guaranteed in Article\u00a08 thereof, as derived from the case-law of the Court, as well as the importance of the right to freedom of expression, given that that fundamental right, guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter, constitutes one of the essential foundations of a pluralist, democratic society, and is one of the values on which, under Article\u00a02 TEU, the Union is founded (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0114 and the case-law cited).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be made clear, in that regard, that the retention of traffic and location data constitutes, in itself, first, a derogation from the prohibition laid down in Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2002/58 barring any person other than the users from storing those data, and, second, an interference with the fundamental rights to the respect for private life and the protection of personal data, enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, irrespective of whether the information in question relating to private life is sensitive, whether the persons concerned have been inconvenienced in any way on account of that interference, or, furthermore, whether the data retained will or will not be used subsequently (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0115 and 116 and the case-law cited).\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion is all the more justified since traffic and location data may reveal information on a significant number of aspects of the private life of the persons concerned, including sensitive information such as sexual orientation, political opinions, religious, philosophical, societal or other beliefs and state of health, given that such data moreover enjoy special protection under EU law. Taken as a whole, those data may allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data have been retained, such as the habits of everyday life, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social relationships of those persons and the social environments frequented by them. In particular, those data provide the means of establishing a profile of the individuals concerned, information that is no less sensitive, having regard to the right to privacy, than the actual content of communications (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0117 and the case-law cited).\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, first, the retention of traffic and location data for policing purposes is liable, in itself, to infringe the right to respect for communications, enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, and to deter users of electronic communications systems from exercising their freedom of expression, guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter, effects that are all the more serious given the quantity and breadth of data retained. Second, in view of the significant quantity of traffic and location data that may be continuously retained under a general and indiscriminate retention measure, as well as the sensitive nature of the information that may be gleaned from those data, the mere retention of such data by providers of electronic communications services entails a risk of abuse and unlawful access (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0118 and 119 and the case-law cited).\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be emphasised that the retention of and access to those data each constitute, as is clear from the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a044 of this judgment, separate interferences with the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 11 of the Charter, requiring a separate justification pursuant to Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter. It follows that national legislation ensuring full respect for the conditions established by the case-law interpreting Directive 2002/58 as regards access to retained data cannot, by its very nature, be capable of either limiting or even remedying the serious interference, which results from the general retention of those data provided for under that national legislation, with the rights guaranteed by Articles\u00a05 and 6 of that directive and by the fundamental rights to which those articles give specific effect.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being said, in so far as Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 allows Member States to introduce the derogations referred to in paragraph\u00a034 to 37 of this judgment, that provision reflects the fact that the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 of the Charter are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society. Indeed, as can be seen from Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, that provision allows limitations to be placed on the exercise of those rights, provided that those limitations are provided for by law, that they respect the essence of those rights and that, in compliance with the principle of proportionality, they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others. Thus, in order to interpret Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 in the light of the Charter, account must also be taken of the importance of the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a03, 4, 6 and 7 of the Charter and of the importance of the objectives of protecting national security and combating serious crime in contributing to the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \n La Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0120 to 122 and the case-law cited).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus as regards, in particular, effective action to combat criminal offences committed against, inter alia, minors and other vulnerable persons, it should be borne in mind that positive obligations of the public authorities may result from Article\u00a07 of the Charter, requiring them to adopt legal measures to protect private and family life. Such obligations may also arise from Article\u00a07, concerning the protection of an individual\u2019s home and communications, and Articles\u00a03 and 4, as regards the protection of an individual\u2019s physical and mental integrity and the prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0126 and the case-law cited).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is against the backdrop of those different positive obligations that the Court must strike a balance between the various interests and rights at issue. The European Court of Human Rights has held that the positive obligations flowing from Articles\u00a03 and 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, whose corresponding safeguards are set out in Articles\u00a04 and 7 of the Charter, require, in particular, the adoption of substantive and procedural provisions as well as practical measures enabling effective action to combat crimes against the person through effective investigation and prosecution, that obligation being all the more important when a child\u2019s physical and moral well-being is at risk. However, the measures to be taken by the competent authorities must fully respect due process and the other safeguards limiting the scope of criminal investigation powers, as well as other freedoms and rights. In particular, according to that court, a legal framework should be established enabling a balance to be struck between the various interests and rights to be protected (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0127 and 128 and the case-law cited).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it is clear from the wording itself of the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 that the Member States may adopt a measure derogating from the principle of confidentiality referred to in paragraph\u00a035 of this judgment where such a measure is \u2018necessary, appropriate and proportionate\u00a0\u2026 within a democratic society\u2019, and recital\u00a011 of the directive specifies, in that respect, that a measure of that nature must be \u2018strictly\u2019 proportionate to the intended purpose (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0129).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that the protection of the fundamental right to privacy requires, according to the settled case-law of the Court, that derogations from and limitations on the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. In addition, an objective of general interest may not be pursued without having regard to the fact that it must be reconciled with the fundamental rights affected by the measure, by properly balancing the objective of general interest against the rights at issue (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0130 and the case-law cited).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, it follows from the Court\u2019s case-law that the question whether the Member States may justify a limitation on the rights and obligations laid down, inter alia, in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58 must be assessed by measuring the seriousness of the interference entailed by such a limitation and by verifying that the importance of the public interest objective pursued by that limitation is proportionate to that seriousness (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0131 and the case-law cited).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to satisfy the requirement of proportionality, the national legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose personal data are affected have sufficient guarantees that those data will be effectively protected against the risk of abuse. That legislation must be legally binding under domestic law and, in particular, must indicate in what circumstances and under which conditions a measure providing for the processing of such data may be adopted, thereby ensuring that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data are subjected to automated processing, in particular where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to those data. Those considerations apply especially where the protection of the particular category of personal data that are sensitive data is at stake (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0132 and the case-law cited).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, national legislation requiring the retention of personal data must always meet objective criteria that establish a connection between the data to be retained and the objective pursued. In particular, as regards combating serious crime, the data whose retention is provided for must be capable of contributing to the prevention, detection or prosecution of serious offences (see, to that effect, judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n,\n\u00a0\nC-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a059, and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0133).\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the public interest objectives that may justify a measure taken pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, it is clear from the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), that, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, there is a hierarchy amongst those objectives according to their respective importance and that the importance of the objective pursued by such a measure must be proportionate to the seriousness of the interference that it entails.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court held that the importance of the objective of safeguarding national security, read in the light of Article\u00a04(2) TEU according to which national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State, exceeds that of the other objectives referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, inter alia the objectives of combating crime in general, even serious crime, and of safeguarding public security. Subject to meeting the other requirements laid down in Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, the objective of safeguarding national security is therefore capable of justifying measures entailing more serious interferences with fundamental rights than those which might be justified by those other objectives (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0135 and 136).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for that reason that the Court held that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8, 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, does not preclude legislative measures that allow, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, recourse to an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services to retain, generally and indiscriminately, traffic and location data in situations where the Member State concerned is confronted with a serious threat to national security that is shown to be genuine and present or foreseeable, where the decision imposing such an instruction is subject to effective review, either by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision is binding, the aim of that review being to verify that one of those situations exists and that the conditions and safeguards which must be laid down are observed, and where that instruction may be given only for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary, but which may be extended if that threat persists (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0168).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objective of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences, the Court held that, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, only action to combat serious crime and measures to prevent serious threats to public security are capable of justifying serious interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, such as the interference entailed by the retention of traffic and location data. Accordingly, only non-serious interference with those fundamental rights may be justified by the objective of preventing, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences in general (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0140 and the case-law cited).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the hearing, the European Commission submitted that particularly serious crime could be treated in the same way as a threat to national security.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the Court has already held that the objective of protecting national security corresponds to the primary interest in protecting the essential functions of the State and the fundamental interests of society through the prevention and punishment of activities capable of seriously destabilising the fundamental constitutional, political, economic or social structures of a country and, in particular, of directly threatening society, the population or the State itself, such as terrorist activities (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0135).\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be observed that, unlike crime, even particularly serious crime, a threat to national security must be genuine and present, or, at the very least, foreseeable, which presupposes that sufficiently concrete circumstances have arisen to be able to justify a generalised and indiscriminate measure of retention of traffic and location data for a limited period of time. Such a threat is therefore distinguishable, by its nature, its seriousness, and the specific nature of the circumstances of which it is constituted, from the general and permanent risk of the occurrence of tensions or disturbances, even of a serious nature, that affect public security, or from that of serious criminal offences being committed (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0136 and 137).\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, criminal behaviour, even of a particularly serious nature, cannot be treated in the same way as a threat to national security. As the Advocate General observed in points\u00a049 to 50 of his Opinion, to treat those situations in the same way would be likely to create an intermediate category between national security and public security for the purpose of applying to the latter the requirements inherent in the former.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It also follows that the fact, recalled in the second question referred for a preliminary ruling, that traffic and location data were legally the object of retention for the purpose of safeguarding national security does not have any bearing on the legality of their retention for the purpose of combating serious crime.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objective of combating serious crime, the Court held that national legislation providing, for that purpose, for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data exceeds the limits of what is strictly necessary and cannot be considered to be justified within a democratic society. In view of the sensitive nature of the information that traffic and location data may provide, the confidentiality of those data is essential for the right to respect for private life. Thus, and also taking into account, first, the dissuasive effect on the exercise of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 11 of the Charter, referred to in paragraph\u00a046 of this judgment, which is liable to result from the retention of those data, and, second, the seriousness of the interference entailed by such retention, it is necessary, within a democratic society, that retention be the exception and not the rule, as provided for in the system established by Directive 2002/58, and that those data should not be retained systematically and continuously. That conclusion applies even having regard to the objectives of combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security and to the importance that must be attached to them (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0141 and 142 and the case-law cited).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Court has emphasised that national legislation providing for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data covers the electronic communications of practically the entire population without any differentiation, limitation or exception being made in the light of the objective pursued. Such legislation is comprehensive in that it affects all persons using electronic communication services, even though those persons are not, even indirectly, in a situation that is liable to give rise to criminal proceedings. It therefore applies even to persons with respect to whom there is no evidence capable of suggesting that their conduct might have a link, even an indirect or remote one, with that objective of combating serious crime and, in particular, without there being any relationship between the data whose retention is provided for and a threat to public security. In particular, as the Court has already held, such legislation is not restricted to retention in relation to (i) data pertaining to a time period and/or geographical area and/or a group of persons likely to be involved, in one way or another, in a serious crime, or (ii) persons who could, for other reasons, contribute, through their data being retained, to combating serious crime (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0143 and 144 and the case-law cited).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in paragraph\u00a0168 of the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), the Court stated that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8, 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, does not preclude legislative measures that provide, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, for\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the targeted retention of traffic and location data which is limited, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, according to the categories of persons concerned or using a geographical criterion, for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary, but which may be extended;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the general and indiscriminate retention of IP addresses assigned to the source of an internet connection for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the general and indiscriminate retention of data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems; and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0recourse to an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services, by means of a decision of the competent authority that is subject to effective judicial review, to undertake, for a specified period of time, the expedited retention (\nquick freeze\n) of traffic and location data in the possession of those service providers,\nprovided that those measures ensure, by means of clear and precise rules, that the retention of data at issue is subject to compliance with the applicable substantive and procedural conditions and that the persons concerned have effective safeguards against the risks of abuse.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present order for reference, which was lodged with the Court before the judgments of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), and of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n (C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152), were delivered, the referring court considered however that only the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data allows serious crime to be combated effectively. At the hearing on 13\u00a0September 2021, it was submitted, inter alia by Ireland and the French Government, that that conclusion was not invalidated by the fact that it was possible for the Member States to have recourse to the measures referred to in the preceding paragraph.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be observed, in the first place, that the effectiveness of criminal proceedings generally depends not on a single means of investigation but on all the means of investigation available to the competent national authorities for those purposes.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it must be noted that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, as interpreted by the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a067 of this judgment, allows Member States to adopt, for the purposes of combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, not only measures for targeted retention and expedited retention, but also measures providing for the general and indiscriminate retention, first, of data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems and, second, of IP addresses assigned to the source of a connection.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, it is common ground that retention of data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems may contribute to the fight against serious crime to the extent that those data make it possible to identify persons who have used those means in the context of planning or committing an act constituting serious crime.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is clear from the case-law summarised in paragraph\u00a067 of this judgment, Directive 2002/58 does not preclude, for the purposes of combating crime in general, the general retention of data relating to civil identity. In those circumstances, it must be stated that neither the directive nor any other EU law act precludes national legislation, which has the purpose of combating serious crime, pursuant to which the purchase of a means of electronic communication, such as a pre-paid SIM card, is subject to a check of official documents establishing the purchaser\u2019s identity and the registration, by the seller, of that information, with the seller being required, should the case arise, to give access to that information to the competent national authorities.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it should be recalled that the generalised retention of IP addresses of the source of connection constitutes a serious interference in the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter as those IP addresses may allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private life of the user of the means of electronic communication concerned and may be a deterrent to the exercise of freedom of expression guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter. However, as regards such retention, the Court has held that in order to strike the necessary balance between the rights and interests at issue as required by the case-law referred to in paragraphs\u00a050 to 53 of this judgment, it is necessary to take into account, in a case of an offence committed online and, in particular, in cases of the acquisition, dissemination, transmission or making available online of child pornography, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(c) of Directive 2011/93/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13\u00a0December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA (OJ 2011 L\u00a0335, p.\u00a01), the fact that the IP address might be the only means of investigation enabling the person to whom that address was assigned at the time of the commission of the offence to be identified (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0153 and 154).\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hence, the Court held that such general and indiscriminate retention solely of IP addresses assigned to the source of a connection does not, in principle, appear to be contrary to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 of the Charter, provided that that possibility is subject to strict compliance with the substantive and procedural conditions which should regulate the use of those data, as referred to in paragraphs\u00a0155 and 156 of the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others \n(C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791).\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, as regards legislative measures providing for a targeted retention and an expedited retention of traffic and location data, the indications provided in the order for reference show a narrower understanding of the scope of those measures than that upheld in the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a067 of this judgment. While, as is recalled in paragraph\u00a040 of this judgment, those retention measures are a derogation within the system established by Directive 2002/58, that directive, read in the light of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, does not make the possibility of issuing an order requiring a targeted retention subject to the condition either that the places likely to be the location of a serious crime or the persons suspected of being involved in such an act must be known in advance. Likewise, that directive does not require that the order requiring an expedited retention be limited to suspects identified in advance of that order.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, first, targeted retention, the Court held that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 does not preclude national legislation based on objective evidence which makes it possible to target persons whose traffic and location data are likely to reveal a link, at least an indirect one, with serious criminal offences, to contribute in one way or another to combating serious crime or to preventing a serious risk to public security or a risk to national security (judgments of 21\u00a0December 2016,\n Tele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0111, and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0148).\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court stated, in that regard, that, while the objective evidence may vary according to the nature of the measures taken for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, the persons thus targeted may, in particular, be persons who have been identified beforehand, in the course of the applicable national procedures and on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, as posing a threat to public or national security in the Member State concerned (see, to that effect, judgments of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0110, and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0149).\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States thus have, inter alia, the option of imposing retention measures targeting persons who, on the basis of an identification, are the subject of an investigation or other measures of current surveillance or of a reference in the national criminal record relating to an earlier conviction for serious crimes with a high risk of reoffending. Where that identification is based on objective and non-discriminatory factors, defined in national law, targeted retention in respect of persons thus identified is justified.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, a targeted measure for the retention of traffic and location data may, at the choice of the national legislature and in strict compliance with the principle of proportionality, also be set using a geographical criterion where the competent national authorities consider, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, that there exists, in one or more geographical areas, a situation characterised by a high risk of preparation for or commission of serious criminal offences. Those areas may include places with a high incidence of serious crime, places that are particularly vulnerable to serious crime, such as places or infrastructure which regularly receive a very high volume of visitors, or strategic locations, such as airports, stations, maritime ports or tollbooth areas (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0150 and the case-law cited).\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be borne in mind that, according to that case-law, the competent national authorities may adopt, for areas referred to in the preceding paragraph, a targeted measure of retention using a geographic criterion, such as, inter alia, the average crime rate in a geographical area, without that authority necessarily having specific indications as to the preparation or commission, in the areas concerned, of acts of serious crime. Since a targeted retention using that criterion is likely to concern, depending on the serious criminal offences in question and the situation specific to the respective Member States, both the areas marked by a high incidence of serious crime and areas particularly vulnerable to the commission of those acts, it is, in principle, not likely moreover to give rise to discrimination, as the criterion drawn from the average rate of serious crime is entirely unconnected with any potentially discriminatory factors.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition and above all, a targeted measure of retention covering places or infrastructures which regularly receive a very high volume of visitors, or strategic places, such as airports, stations, maritime ports or tollbooth areas, allows the competent authorities to collect traffic data and, in particular, location data of all persons using, at a specific time, a means of electronic communication in one of those places. Thus, such a targeted retention measure may allow those authorities to obtain, through access to the retained data, information as to the presence of those persons in the places or geographical areas covered by that measure as well as their movements between or within those areas and to draw, for the purposes of combating serious crime, conclusions as to their presence and activity in those places or geographical areas at a specific time during the period of retention.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that the geographic areas covered by such a targeted retention measure may and, where appropriate, must be amended in accordance with changes in the circumstances that justified their selection, thus making it possible to react to developments in the fight against serious crime. The Court has held that the duration of those targeted retention measures described in paragraphs\u00a076 to 81 of this judgment must not exceed what is strictly necessary in the light of the objective pursued and the circumstances justifying them, without prejudice to the possibility of extending those measures should such retention continue to be necessary (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020,\n La Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0151).\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the possibility of providing distinctive criteria other than a personal or geographic criterion for the targeted retention of traffic and location data, it is possible that other objective and non-discriminatory criteria may be considered in order to ensure that the scope of a targeted retention measure is as limited as is strictly necessary and to establish a connection, at least indirectly, between serious criminal acts and the persons whose data are retained. However, since Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 refers to legislative measures of the Member States, it is for the latter and not for the Court to identify those criteria, it being understood that there can be no question of reinstating, by that means, the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, as Advocate General Campos S\u00e1nchez-Bordona observed in point\u00a050 of his Opinion in Joined Cases \nSpaceNet and Telekom Deutschland \n(C-793/19 and C-794/19, EU:C:2021:939), the fact that it may be difficult to provide a detailed definition of the circumstances and conditions under which targeted retention may be carried out is no reason for the Member States, by turning the exception into a rule, to provide for the general retention of traffic and location data.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, second, the expedited retention of traffic and location data processed and stored by providers of electronic communications services on the basis of Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58 or on the basis of legislative measures taken under Article\u00a015(1) of that directive, it should be noted that those data must, in principle, be erased or made anonymous, depending on the circumstances, at the end of the statutory periods within which those data must be processed and stored in accordance with the national provisions transposing that directive. Nevertheless, the Court has held that during that processing and storage, situations may arise in which it becomes necessary to retain those data after those time periods have ended in order to shed light on serious criminal offences or acts adversely affecting national security; this is the case both in situations where those offences or acts having adverse effects have already been established and where, after an objective examination of all of the relevant circumstances, such offences or acts having adverse effects may reasonably be suspected (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0160 and 161).\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In such a situation, in the light of the balance that must be struck between the rights and interests at issue referred to in paragraphs\u00a050 to 53 of this judgment, it is permissible for Member States to provide, in legislation adopted pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, for the possibility of instructing, by means of a decision of the competent authority subject to effective judicial review, providers of electronic communications services to undertake the expedited retention of traffic and location data at their disposal for a specified period of time (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0163).\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent that the purpose of that expedited retention no longer corresponds to the purpose for which those data were initially collected and retained and since any processing of data must, under Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter, be consistent with specified purposes, Member States must make clear, in their legislation, for what purpose the expedited retention of data may occur. In the light of the serious nature of the interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter which such retention may entail, only actions to combat serious crime and, a fortiori, to safeguard national security are such as to justify such interference, on the condition that the measure and access to the retained data comply with the limits of what is strictly necessary, as set out in paragraphs\u00a0164 to 167 of the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791).\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has stated that a measure of retention of that nature need not be limited to the data of persons who have been identified previously as being a threat to public security or national security of the Member State concerned or of persons specifically suspected of having committed a serious criminal offence or acts adversely affecting national security. According to the Court, while it must comply with the framework established by Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, and taking into account the findings in paragraph\u00a055 of this judgment, such a measure may, at the choice of the national legislature and subject to the limits of what is strictly necessary, be extended to traffic and location data relating to persons other than those who are suspected of having planned or committed a serious criminal offence or acts adversely affecting national security, provided that those data can, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, shed light on such an offence or acts adversely affecting national security, such as data concerning the victim thereof, and his or her social or professional circle (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0165).\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, a legislative measure may authorise the issuing of an instruction to providers of electronic communications services to carry out the expedited retention of traffic and location data, inter alia, of persons with whom, prior to the serious threat to public security arising or a serious crime being committed, a victim was in contact via those electronic means of communications.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such expedited retention may, according to the Court\u2019s case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a088 of this judgment and under the same conditions as those referred to in that paragraph, also be extended to specific geographic areas, such as the places of the commission of or preparation for the offence or attack on national security in question. It should be stated that the subject matter of such a measure may also be the traffic and location data relating to a place or a person, possibly the victim of a serious crime, who has disappeared, on condition that that measure and access to the data so retained comply with the limits of what is strictly necessary, as set out in paragraphs\u00a0164 to 167 of the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020,\n La Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791).\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it must be stated that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 does not preclude the competent national authorities from ordering a measure of expedited retention at the first stage of an investigation into a serious threat for public security or a possible serious crime, namely from the time when the authorities may, in accordance with the provisions of national law, commence such an investigation.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the variety of measures for the retention of traffic and location data referred to in paragraph\u00a067 of this judgment, it must be stated that those various measures may, at the choice of the national legislature and subject to the limits of what is strictly necessary, be applied concurrently. Accordingly, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, as interpreted by case-law resulting from the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), does not preclude a combination of those measures.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fourth and final place, it must be emphasised that the proportionality of the measures adopted pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 requires, according to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, as recalled in the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020,\n La Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), compliance not only with the requirements of aptitude and of necessity but also with that of the proportionate nature of those measures in relation to the objective pursued.\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should be recalled that, in paragraph\u00a051 of its judgment of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others \n(C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238), the Court held that while the fight against serious crime is indeed of the utmost importance in order to ensure public security and its effectiveness may depend to a great extent on the use of modern investigation techniques, that objective of general interest, however fundamental it may be, does not, in itself, justify that a measure providing for the general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data, such as that established by Directive 2006/24, should be considered to be necessary.\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the same vein, the Court stated, in paragraph\u00a0145 of the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others \n(C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), that even the positive obligations of the Member States which may arise, depending on the circumstances, from Articles\u00a03, 4 and 7 of the Charter and which relate, as pointed out in paragraph\u00a049 of this judgment, to the establishment of rules to facilitate effective action to combat criminal offences, cannot have the effect of justifying interference that is as serious as that entailed by legislation providing for the retention of traffic and location data with the fundamental rights, enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, of practically the entire population, in circumstances where the data of the persons concerned are not liable to disclose a link, at least an indirect one, between those data and the objective pursued.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the hearing, the Danish Government submitted that the competent national authorities should be able to access, for the purpose of fighting serious crime, traffic and location data which have been retained in a general and indiscriminate way, in accordance with the line of case-law resulting from the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0135 to 139), in order to address a serious threat to national security that is genuine and present, or foreseeable.\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be observed, first of all, that the fact of authorising access for the purpose of combating serious crime to traffic and location data which have been retained in a general and indiscriminate way would make that access depend upon facts that fall outside that objective, according to whether or not, in the Member State concerned there was a serious threat to national security as referred to in the preceding paragraph, whereas, in view of the sole objective of the fight against serious crime which must justify the retention of those data and access thereto, there is nothing to justify a difference in treatment, in particular, as between the Member States.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has already held, access to traffic and location data retained by providers in accordance with a measure taken under Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, which must be given effect in full compliance with the conditions resulting from the case-law interpreting Directive 2002/58, may, in principle, be justified only by the public interest objective for which those providers were ordered to retain those data. It is otherwise only if the importance of the objective pursued by access is greater than that of the objective which justified retention (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0165 and 166).\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Danish Government\u2019s submission refers to a situation in which the objective pursued by the access request proposed, namely the fight against serious crime, is of lesser importance in the hierarchy of objectives of public interest than that which justified the retention, namely the safeguarding of national security. To authorise, in that situation, access to retained data would be contrary to that hierarchy of public interest objectives recalled in the preceding paragraph, and also to paragraphs\u00a053, 56, 57 and 59 of this judgment.\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition and moreover, in accordance with the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a065 of this judgment, traffic and location data cannot be the object of general and indiscriminate retention for the purpose of combating serious crime and, therefore, access to those data cannot be justified for that same purpose. Where those data have exceptionally been retained in a general and indiscriminate way for the purpose of the safeguarding of national security against a genuine and present or foreseeable threat, in the circumstances referred to in paragraph\u00a058 of this judgment, the national authorities competent to undertake criminal investigations cannot access those data in the context of criminal proceedings, without depriving of any effectiveness the prohibition on such retention for the purpose of combating serious crime, recalled in paragraph\u00a065.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first, second and fourth questions is that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding legislative measures which provide, as a preventive measure, for the purposes of combating serious crime and for the prevention of serious threats to public security, for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data. However, Article\u00a015(1), read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, does not preclude legislative measures that, for the purposes of combating serous crime and preventing serious threats to public security, provide for:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the targeted retention of traffic and location data which is limited, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, according to the categories of persons concerned or using a geographical criterion, for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary, but which may be extended;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the general and indiscriminate retention of IP addresses assigned to the source of an internet connection for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the general and indiscriminate retention of data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems; and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0recourse to an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services, by means of a decision of the competent authority that is subject to effective judicial review, to undertake, for a specified period of time, the expedited retention of traffic and location data in the possession of those service providers,\nprovided that those measures ensure, by means of clear and precise rules, that the retention of data at issue is subject to compliance with the applicable substantive and procedural conditions and that the persons concerned have effective safeguards against the risks of abuse.\n\u00a0\nThe third question\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation pursuant to which the centralised processing of requests for access to retained data, issued by the police in the context of the investigation or prosecution of serious criminal offences, is the responsibility of a police officer, assisted by a unit established within the police service which enjoys a degree of autonomy in the exercise of its duties and whose decisions may subsequently by subject to judicial review.\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary matter, it should be borne in mind that, while it is for national law to determine the conditions under which providers of electronic communications services must grant the competent national authorities access to data in their possession, the national legislation must, in order to satisfy the requirement of proportionality, as recalled in paragraph\u00a054 of this judgment, lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose personal data are affected have sufficient guarantees that those data will be effectively protected against the risk of abuse (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, \n C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraph\u00a048 and the case-law cited).\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, national legislation governing the access by the competent authorities to retained traffic and location data, adopted pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, cannot be limited to requiring that the authorities\u2019 access to the data be consistent with the objective pursued by that legislation, but must also lay down the substantive and procedural conditions governing that use (judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraph\u00a049 and the case-law cited).\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, since general access to all retained data, regardless of whether there is any, at least indirect, link with the intended purpose, cannot be regarded as being limited to what is strictly necessary, the national legislation concerned must be based on objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which the competent national authorities are to be granted access to the data in question. In that regard, such access can, as a general rule, be granted, in relation to the objective of fighting crime, only to the data of individuals suspected of planning, committing or having committed a serious crime or of being implicated in one way or another in such a crime. However, in particular situations, where for example vital national security, defence or public security interests are threatened by terrorist activities, access to the data of other persons might also be granted where there is objective evidence from which it can be deduced that those data might, in a specific case, make an effective contribution to combating such activities (judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, \n C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraph\u00a050 and the case-law cited).\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure, in practice, that those conditions are fully observed, it is essential that access by the competent national authorities to retained data be subject to a prior review carried out either by a court or by an independent administrative body, and that the decision of that court or body be made following a reasoned request by those authorities submitted, inter alia, within the framework of procedures for the prevention, detection or prosecution of crime (judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraph\u00a051 and the case-law cited).\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the requirements for the prior review is that the court or independent administrative body entrusted with carrying it out must have all the powers and provide all the guarantees necessary in order to reconcile the various interests and rights at issue. As regards a criminal investigation in particular, it is a requirement of such a review that that court or body must be able to strike a fair balance between, on the one hand, the interests relating to the needs of the investigation in the context of combating crime and, on the other, the fundamental rights to privacy and protection of personal data of the persons whose data are concerned by the access (judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraph\u00a052).\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where that review is carried out not by a court but by an independent administrative body, that body must have a status that enables it to act objectively and impartially when carrying out its duties and must, for that purpose, be free from any external influence. Accordingly, it follows that the requirement of independence that has to be satisfied by the body entrusted with carrying out the prior review means that that body must be a third party in relation to the authority which requests access to the data, in order that the former is able to carry out the review objectively and impartially and free from any external influence. In particular, in the criminal field the requirement of independence entails that the body entrusted with the prior review, first, should not be involved in the conduct of the criminal investigation in question and, second, must have a neutral stance vis-\u00e0-vis the parties to the criminal proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, \n C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraphs\u00a053 and 54).\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the Court has, inter alia, found that a public prosecutor\u2019s office, which directs the investigation procedure and, where appropriate, brings the public prosecution cannot be considered to have third party status in relation to the interests at issue, since it has the task not of ruling on a case in complete independence but, acting as prosecutor in the proceedings, of bringing it, where appropriate, before the court that has jurisdiction. Consequently, a public prosecutor\u2019s office is not in a position to carry out the prior review of requests for access to retained data (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraphs\u00a055 and 57).\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the independent review required in accordance with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 must take place before any access to the data concerned, except in the event of duly justified urgency, in which case the review must take place within a short time. A subsequent review would not enable the objective of a prior review, consisting in preventing the authorisation of access to the data in question that exceeds what is strictly necessary, to be met (see, to that effect, judgments of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0189, and of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraph\u00a058).\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that the 2011 Act assigns to a police officer, whose rank is not below that of chief superintendent, the power to carry out the prior review of requests for access to data issued by the police investigation services and to request the providers of electronic communications services to transmit the data that they retain to those services. To the extent that that officer does not have the status of a third party in relation to those services, he or she does not fulfil the requirements for independence and impartiality recalled in paragraph\u00a0108 of this judgment, notwithstanding the fact that he or she is assisted in that duty by a police unit, in this case the TLU, which benefits from a certain degree of autonomy in the exercise of its duties.\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, while it is true that the 2011 Act provides for mechanisms of review subsequent to the decision of the competent police officer in the form of a complaint procedure and a procedure before a judge responsible for examining the application of the provisions of that act, it is clear from the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a0110 of this judgment that a review carried out subsequently cannot be substituted for the requirement, recalled in paragraph\u00a0106 of this judgment, for a review that is independent and, except in duly justified urgent cases, undertaken beforehand.\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the 2011 Act does not lay down any objective criteria which define precisely the conditions and circumstances in which national authorities must be granted access to data and the police officer responsible for processing the requests for access to retained data is solely competent, as Ireland confirmed at the hearing, to assess the suspicions that exist with respect to the persons concerned and the need for access to data that relate to them.\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the answer to the third question is that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation pursuant to which the centralised processing of requests for access to data retained by providers of electronic communications services, issued by the police in the context of the investigation or prosecution of serious criminal offences, is the responsibility of a police officer, who is assisted by a unit established within the police service which has a degree of autonomy in the exercise of its duties, and whose decisions may subsequently be subject to judicial review.\n\u00a0\nThe fifth and sixth questions\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fifth and sixth questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring courts asks, in essence, whether EU law must be interpreted as meaning that a national court may limit the temporal effects of a declaration of invalidity which it is required to make, under national law, with respect to national legislation imposing on providers of electronic communications services the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data owing to the incompatibility of that legislation with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 read in the light of the Charter.\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the information provided by the referring court that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, namely the 2011 Act, was adopted in order to transpose into national law Directive 2006/24, which was later declared invalid by the Court in its judgment of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others \n(C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238).\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the referring court states that, while the assessment of the admissibility of the evidence based on data retained pursuant to the 2011 Act and relied on as regards G.D. in the context of the criminal proceedings is a matter for the criminal court, it is nevertheless, in the context of the civil proceedings, its responsibility to rule on the validity of the provisions at issue of that act and on the temporal effects of a declaration of invalidity of those provisions. Thus, while the sole issue raised before the referring court is that of the validity of the provisions of the 2011 Act, that court considers however that it is necessary to inquire of the Court as to the effect of a possible finding of invalidity on the admissibility of the evidence obtained by means of the general and indiscriminate retention of data that that act permitted.\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it should be recalled that the principle of the primacy of EU law establishes the pre-eminence of EU law over the law of the Member States. That principle therefore requires all Member State bodies to give full effect to the various provisions of EU law, and the law of the Member States may not undermine the effect accorded to those various provisions in the territory of those States. In the light of that principle, where it is unable to interpret national legislation in compliance with the requirements of EU law, the national court which is called upon within the exercise of its jurisdiction to apply provisions of EU law is under a duty to give full effect to those provisions, if necessary refusing of its own motion to apply any conflicting provision of national legislation, even if adopted subsequently, and it is not necessary for that court to request or await the prior setting aside of such provision by legislative or other constitutional means (see, to that effect, judgments of 15\u00a0July 1964, \nCosta\n, 6/64, EU:C:1964:66, p.\u00a0594; of 19\u00a0November 2019, \nA.\u00a0K. and Others (Independence of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court)\n, C-585/18, C-624/18 and C-625/18, EU:C:2019:982, paragraphs\u00a0157, 158 and 160; and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0214 and 215).\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only the Court may, in exceptional cases, on the basis of overriding considerations of legal certainty, allow the temporary suspension of the ousting effect of a rule of EU law with respect to national law that is contrary thereto. Such a restriction on the temporal effects of the interpretation of that law, made by the Court, may be granted only in the actual judgment ruling upon the interpretation requested. The primacy and uniform application of EU law would be undermined if national courts had the power to give provisions of national law primacy in relation to EU law contravened by those provisions, even temporarily (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020,\n La Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0216 and 217 and the case-law cited).\n120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that the Court has held, in a case concerning the lawfulness of measures adopted in breach of the obligation under EU law to conduct a prior assessment of the impact of a project on the environment and on a protected site, that if domestic law allows it, a national court may, by way of exception, maintain the effects of such measures where such maintenance is justified by overriding considerations relating to the need to nullify a genuine and serious threat of interruption in the electricity supply in the Member State concerned, which cannot be remedied by any other means or alternatives, particularly in the context of the internal market, and continues only for as long as is strictly necessary to remedy the breach (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0July 2019, \nInter-Environnement Wallonie and Bond Beter Leefmilieu Vlaanderen\n, C-411/17, EU:C:2019:622, paragraphs\u00a0175, 176, 179 and 181).\n121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, unlike a breach of a procedural obligation such as the prior assessment of the impact of a project in the specific field of environmental protection, a failure to comply with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, cannot be remedied by a procedure comparable to the procedure referred to in the preceding paragraph (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0219).\n122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maintaining the effects of national legislation such as the 2011 Act would mean that the legislation would continue to impose on providers of electronic communications services obligations which are contrary to EU law and which seriously interfere with the fundamental rights of the persons whose data have been retained (see, by analogy, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0219).\n123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the referring court cannot limit the temporal effects of a declaration of invalidity which it is bound to make under national law in respect of the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings (see, by analogy, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0220).\n124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as the Advocate General observed in essence in point\u00a075 of his Opinion, the fact that that legislation was adopted in order to transpose Directive 2006/24 into national law is irrelevant since, due to the Court\u2019s decision that that directive was invalid, the invalidity has effect as from the date of its entry into force (see, to that effect, judgment of 8\u00a0February 1996,\n FMC and Others\n, C-212/94, EU:C:1996:40, paragraph\u00a055), the validity of that national legislation must be assessed by the referring court in the light of Directive 2002/58 and the Charter, as interpreted by the Court.\n125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, more specifically, the interpretation of Directive 2002/58 and the Charter upheld by the Court in its judgments of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, the interpretation that the Court gives to a rule of EU law, in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by Article\u00a0267 TFEU, clarifies and defines the meaning and scope of that rule as it must be, or ought to have been, understood and applied from the time of its coming into force. It follows that the rule as thus interpreted may and must be applied by the courts to legal relationships arising and established before the judgment ruling on the request for interpretation, provided that in other respects the conditions for bringing an action relating to the application of that rule before the courts having jurisdiction are satisfied (judgment of 16\u00a0September 2020, \nRomenergo and Aris Capital\n, C-339/19, EU:C:2020:709, paragraph\u00a047 and the case-law cited).\n126\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should also be stated that a temporal limitation of the effects of the interpretation given was not imposed in the judgments of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), with the result that, in accordance with the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a0119 of this judgment, it should not be imposed in a judgment of the Court subsequent to those judgments.\n127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, as regards the effect of a declaration of the potential incompatibility of the 2011 Act with Directive 2002/58, read in the light of the Charter, on the admissibility of evidence relied on against G.D. in the context of the criminal proceedings, it suffices to refer to the Court\u2019s case-law on that subject, in particular the principles recalled in paragraphs\u00a041 to 44 of the judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n (C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152), from which it follows that that admissibility is, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy of the Member States, a matter for national law, subject to compliance, inter alia, with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness.\n128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the answer to the fifth and sixth questions is that EU law must be interpreted as precluding a national court from limiting the temporal effects of a declaration of invalidity which it is bound to make, under national law, with respect to national legislation imposing on providers of electronic communications services the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data, owing to the incompatibility of that legislation with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 read in the light of the Charter. The admissibility of evidence obtained by means of such retention is, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy of the Member State, a matter for national law, subject to compliance, inter alia, with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as precluding legislative measures which, as a preventive measure for the purposes of combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, provide for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data. However, that Article\u00a015(1), read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8, 11 and 52(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, does not preclude legislative measures that provide, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, for\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nthe targeted retention of traffic and location data which is limited, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, according to the categories of persons concerned or using a geographical criterion, for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary, but which may be extended;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nthe general and indiscriminate retention of IP addresses assigned to the source of an internet connection for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nthe general and indiscriminate retention of data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems; and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nrecourse to an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services, by means of a decision of the competent authority that is subject to effective judicial review, to undertake, for a specified period of time, the expedited retention of traffic and location data in the possession of those service providers,\nprovided that those measures ensure, by means of clear and precise rules, that the retention of data at issue is subject to compliance with the applicable substantive and procedural conditions and that the persons concerned have effective safeguards against the risks of abuse.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, as amended by Directive 2009/136, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation pursuant to which the centralised processing of requests for access to data, which have been retained by providers of electronic communications services, issued by the police in the context of the investigation or prosecution of serious criminal offences, is the responsibility of a police officer, who is assisted by a unit established within the police service which has a degree of autonomy in the exercise of its duties, and whose decisions may subsequently be subject to judicial review.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEU law must be interpreted as precluding a national court from limiting the temporal effects of a declaration of invalidity which it is bound to make, under national law, with respect to national legislation imposing on providers of electronic communications services the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data, owing to the incompatibility of that legislation with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, as amended by Directive 2009/136, read in the light of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the [European] Union.\n\u2026\n(129)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure consistent monitoring and enforcement of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory authorities should have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers, including powers of investigation, corrective powers and sanctions, and authorisation and advisory powers\u00a0\u2026 Such powers should also include the power to impose a temporary or definitive limitation, including a ban, on processing\u00a0\u2026 In particular each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate in view of ensuring compliance with this Regulation\u00a0\u2026\u2019\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a02 of that regulation, entitled \u2018Material scope\u2019, provides:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Chapter 2 of Title V of the [EU Treaty];\n\u2026\u2019\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03 of that regulation defines its territorial scope.

the CPPD on 28\u00a0January 2021 and by decision of the CEC on 8\u00a0February 2021.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the processing of personal data by means of video recording (recording or live broadcast) in the context of the electoral process, the guidelines at issue provide that the purpose of such processing is to ensure the transparency, objectivity and lawfulness of the electoral process, as well as the equal treatment of participants in that process, and to guarantee freedom of expression and the right to information.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the detailed arrangements for processing personal data by means of video recording during the electoral process, the guidelines at issue provide, on the one hand, that the media are to process personal data by means of video recording only when the election day starts and concludes, when the results of the voting are announced and when the serial numbers of the ballot papers are drawn.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, those guidelines state that no other participants in the electoral process may process personal data by means of video recording, since this would be incompatible with their role in the electoral process.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By application of 10\u00a0February 2021, the Koalitsia contested the lawfulness of those guidelines before the Administrativen sad Sofia (Administrative Court, Sofia, Bulgaria) in so far as they apply to the processing of personal data by means of video recording.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By judgment of 15\u00a0March 2021, that court annulled:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0paragraph\u00a02 of Section I of the guidelines at issue, entitled \u2018General considerations\u2019, in so far as it concerns controllers, processors and persons who process personal data in the context of an electoral process in accordance with the controller\u2019s instructions and which provides that \u2018their rights and obligations with regard to the processing of personal data are limited in so far as their rights and obligations in the context of the electoral process are exhaustively and restrictively set out\u2019, that \u2018the cases in which those persons process personal data are expressly set out in the Electoral Code (right to a direct view when results of the voting are determined, right to obtain copies of the reports of the district electoral commission, etc.)\u2019, and that \u2018when processing personal data, those persons may not go beyond the rights and obligations provided for in the Electoral Code\u2019; and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0paragraph\u00a09 of Section II, entitled \u2018Guidelines for data controllers\u2019, in so far as that paragraph provides that \u2018no other participants in the electoral process may process personal data by means of video recording and/or dissemination, because their role in the electoral process is incompatible with the objective of processing personal data in the electoral process by means of video recording\u2019 and that \u2018the tasks and roles of those participants in the electoral process are expressly and exhaustively defined in the Electoral Code\u2019.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Administrativen sad Sofia (Administrative Court, Sofia), under Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR, that regulation does not apply in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of EU law, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, that is to say, the organisation of national parliamentary or local authority elections in a Member State. Consequently, the guidelines at issue, in so far as they are measures implementing the GDPR, have no legal basis.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 29\u00a0March 2021, the CPPD and the CEC appealed against that judgment to the Varhoven administrativen sad (Supreme Administrative Court, Bulgaria), the referring court.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By application of 2\u00a0April 2021, the CPPD, supported by the CEC, requested that a preliminary ruling be sought from the Court of Justice concerning the applicability of EU law to the case in the main proceedings.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Koalitsia argues before the referring court that that judgment should be upheld and that there is no need to submit a request for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states that the guidelines at issue constitute an administrative measure which has recurring legal effects during elections. It points out that the guidelines at issue apply to all national, local and European elections held on the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court is uncertain, in particular, as to the applicability of the GDPR in the context of the organisation of elections in a Member State and, in the event that it is applicable in that context, as to the impact of the provisions of the GDPR on the ability of the competent personal data protection authorities to limit or, where appropriate, to prohibit the processing of such data in the context of the electoral process.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Varhoven administrativen sad (Supreme Administrative Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the [GDPR] to be interpreted as precluding the application of that regulation to an ostensibly purely internal situation, such as the holding of elections to the National Assembly, where the subject matter of the protection is the personal data of individuals\u00a0\u2013 citizens of the European Union\u00a0\u2013 and the data processing operations are not restricted to the collection of data in the context of the activity in question?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the first question is answered in the affirmative, does the conclusion of the holding of elections to the National Assembly, which do not appear to fall within the scope of EU law, release controllers, processors and persons who store personal data from their obligations under the regulation, as the sole means of protecting personal data of EU citizens at EU level? Does the applicability of the regulation depend solely on the activity for which the personal data were produced or collected, thereby also leading to the conclusion that its subsequent applicability is precluded?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the first question is answered in the negative, do Article\u00a06[(1)](e) of the [GDPR] and the principle of proportionality enshrined in recitals\u00a04 and 129 thereof preclude national rules implementing the regulation, such as those at issue, which preclude and restrict from the outset the possibility of carrying out any video recording during the determination of the election results at polling stations, do not allow for differentiation and regulation of individual elements of the recording process and preclude the possibility of achieving the objectives of the regulation\u00a0\u2013 the protection of personal data of individuals\u00a0\u2013 by other means?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively, and in the context of the scope of application of EU law, do Article\u00a06[(1)](e) of the [GDPR] and the principle of proportionality enshrined in recitals\u00a04 and 129 thereof preclude\u00a0\u2013 in the holding of municipal elections and elections to the European Parliament\u00a0\u2013 national rules implementing that regulation, such as those at issue, which preclude and restrict from the outset the possibility of carrying out any video recording during the determination of the election results at polling stations, do not differentiate and regulate individual elements of the recording process or even allow for such differentiation and regulation, and preclude the possibility of achieving the objectives of the regulation\u00a0\u2013 the protection of personal data of individuals\u00a0\u2013 by other means?\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does Article\u00a06(1)(e) of the [GDPR] preclude the categorisation of the activities of ascertaining lawful conduct and determining the results of elections as a task carried out in the public interest which justifies a certain degree of interference, subject to the requirement of proportionality, with regard to the personal data of persons present at polling stations when they perform an official, public task which is regulated by law?\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the previous question is answered in the affirmative, does the protection of personal data preclude the introduction of a national statutory prohibition on the collection and processing of personal data, which limits the possibility of carrying out ancillary activities consisting in the video recording of materials, objects or items which do not contain personal data, where the recording process potentially gives rise to the possibility of personal data also being collected during the video recording of persons present at polling stations who are carrying out an activity in the public interest at the relevant time?\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe admissibility of the request for a preliminary ruling\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 14\u00a0September 2021, the Court sent a request for information to the referring court, asking it to clarify whether the amendment of Article\u00a0272 of the Electoral Code, which occurred after the request for a preliminary ruling was lodged, had any impact on the relevance of the questions referred for the resolution of the dispute in the main proceedings.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its reply of 29\u00a0October 2021, the referring court stated that, under national procedural law, it must assess the legality of the guidelines at issue by reference not to the date on which that legislative amendment was made, but to the date on which the guidelines at issue were adopted. Consequently, the relevance of the reference for a preliminary ruling is not called into question by that legislative amendment, which took place after the adoption of the guidelines at issue.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, according to the settled case-law of the Court, questions referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court in the legislative and factual context which that court is responsible for defining, and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court of Justice to determine, enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to give a ruling on a question referred by a national court for a preliminary ruling, under Article\u00a0267 TFEU, only where, for instance, the requirements concerning the content of a request for a preliminary ruling, set out in Article\u00a094 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, are not satisfied or where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of a provision of EU law, or the assessment of its validity, which is sought by the national court, bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or to its purpose, or where the problem is hypothetical (judgment of 25\u00a0March 2021, \nObala i lu\u010dice\n, C-307/19, EU:C:2021:236, paragraph\u00a048 and the case-law cited).\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is clear from the explanations given by the referring court that it considers that the response to the questions raised is necessary for it to rule on the dispute before it.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the request for a preliminary ruling is admissible.\n\u00a0\nThe questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\u00a0\nThe first and second questions\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first and second questions, which it is appropriate to consider together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR must be interpreted as excluding from the scope of that regulation the processing of personal data in the context of the organisation of elections in a Member State.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, it should be noted that, pursuant to Article\u00a02(1) of the GDPR, that regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system. According to Article\u00a04(2) of that regulation, the definition of \u2018processing\u2019 includes any operation which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as, inter alia, collection, recording, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the video recording of natural persons amounts to a processing of personal data which falls, in principle, within the material scope of the GDPR (see, to that effect, judgment of 11\u00a0December 2014, \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraph\u00a035).\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, it should be pointed out that the exceptions to the material scope of that regulation are exhaustively set out in Article\u00a02(2) and (3) of that regulation.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the referring court is uncertain as to whether the processing of personal data by means of video recording during the organisation of both European and national elections falls within the exception provided for in Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR, according to which that regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data \u2018in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law\u2019.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be pointed out that that exception to the applicability of the GDPR must, like the other exceptions laid down in Article\u00a02(2), be interpreted strictly (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a062 and the case-law cited).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has held, Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR is to be read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(2)(b) thereof and recital\u00a016, which states that that regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data in the context of \u2018activities which fall outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national security\u2019 and \u2018activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the Union\u2019 (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a063).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that Article\u00a02(2)(a) and (b) of the GDPR represents partly a continuation of the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L\u00a0281, p.\u00a031). Therefore, Article\u00a02(2)(a) and (b) of the GDPR cannot be interpreted in broader terms than the exception resulting from the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, a provision which already excluded from that directive\u2019s scope inter alia the processing of personal data taking place in the course \u2018of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the [EU Treaty, in the version in force prior to the Treaty of Lisbon,] and in any case\u00a0\u2026 processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security\u00a0\u2026\u2019 (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a064).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, only the processing of personal data in the course of an activity of the State or of State authorities which was expressly listed in Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 or in the course of an activity which could be classified in the same category was excluded from the scope of that directive (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a065 and the case-law cited).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital\u00a016 thereof, is designed solely to exclude from the scope of that regulation the processing of personal data carried out by State authorities in the course of an activity which is intended to safeguard national security or of an activity which can be classified in the same category, with the result that the mere fact that an activity is an activity characteristic of the State or of a public authority is not sufficient ground for that exception to be automatically applicable to such an activity (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a066 and the case-law cited).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The activities having the aim of safeguarding national security that are envisaged in Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR encompass, in particular, those that are intended to protect essential State functions and the fundamental interests of society (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a067).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, activities relating to the organisation of elections in a Member State do not pursue such an objective and consequently cannot be classified in the category of activities having the aim of safeguarding national security, which are envisaged in Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first and second questions is that Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR must be interpreted as not excluding from the scope of that regulation the processing of personal data in the context of the organisation of elections in a Member State.\n\u00a0\nThe third to sixth questions\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, it should be observed that, according to settled case-law, in the procedure laid down in Article\u00a0267 TFEU providing for cooperation between national courts and the Court of Justice, it is for the latter to provide the national court with an answer which will be of use to it and enable it to determine the case before it. To that end, the Court may have to reformulate the questions referred to it (see, to that effect, judgment of 7\u00a0July 2022, \nPensionsversicherungsanstalt (Child-raising periods completed abroad)\n, C-576/20, EU:C:2022:525, paragraph\u00a035 and the case-law cited).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For those purposes, the Court may extract from all the information provided by the national court, in particular from the grounds of the order for reference, the points of EU law which require interpretation in view of the subject matter of the dispute in the main proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0June 2022, \nHK/Danmark and HK/Privat\n, C-587/20, EU:C:2022:419, paragraph\u00a018 and the case-law cited).\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is clear from the order for reference that the dispute in the main proceedings essentially concerns the question whether the competent personal data protection authorities may limit or prohibit the processing of such data as regards the possibility of filming the electoral process and, in particular, the vote count.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it is to be understood that, by its third to sixth questions, which it is necessary to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a06(1)(e) and Article\u00a058 of the GDPR must be interpreted as precluding the competent authorities of a Member State from adopting an administrative measure of general application which provides for the limitation or, where appropriate, the prohibition of video recording during the vote count at polling stations in elections in that Member State.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it should be pointed out that Article\u00a06 of the GDPR sets out the conditions for the lawfulness of the processing of personal data.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard more specifically to Article\u00a06(1)(e) of the GDPR, which is specifically referred to in the request for a preliminary ruling, it follows from that provision that the processing of personal data is lawful if it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or a task carried out in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06(1)(e) of the GDPR must be read in conjunction with Article\u00a06(3) thereof, which states that the basis for the processing referred to in Article\u00a06(1)(e) is to be laid down by EU law or by Member State law to which the controller is subject.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The combined provisions of Article\u00a06(1)(e) and Article\u00a06(3) of the GDPR therefore allow Member States to adopt rules on the basis of which controllers may process personal data in the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or a task carried out in the exercise of official authority.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the referring court appears to consider, in the context of its fifth question, that some of the participants present at polling stations during the vote count could be performing a task carried out in the public interest within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(e) of the GDPR.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be pointed out that the lawful processing of personal data by such participants on the basis of Article\u00a06(1)(e) of the GDPR presupposes not only that they can be regarded as performing a task carried out in the public interest, but also that the processing of personal data for the purpose of performing such a task is founded on a legal basis referred to in Article\u00a06(3) of that regulation.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Commission rightly pointed out in its written observations, the guidelines at issue, adopted by the competent Bulgarian supervisory authorities, do not appear to constitute such a legal basis. On the contrary, they appear to constitute a measure aimed at protecting the personal data of the persons present at polling stations by limiting, in the case of media representatives, and prohibiting, in the case of other participants present at polling stations, the processing of such data by means of video recording during a specific phase of the electoral process, namely during the vote count.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it must be borne in mind that the powers of supervisory authorities are laid down in Article\u00a058 of the GDPR.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from Article\u00a058(2)(f) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital\u00a0129 of that regulation, that supervisory authorities are to have, inter alia, the power to impose a temporary or definitive limitation on the processing of personal data, including a ban, and that that power is to be exercised in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Similarly, in accordance with Article\u00a058(3)(b) of the GDPR, each supervisory authority is to have the power to issue, on its own initiative or on request, opinions, in accordance with the law of the Member State concerned, to institutions and bodies other than the national parliament or the government of that Member State as well as to the public, on any issue related to the protection of personal data. Finally, in accordance with Article\u00a058(4) of that regulation, the exercise of those powers is to be subject to appropriate safeguards, including effective judicial remedy.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The description of Bulgarian law and of the guidelines at issue, as set out in the documents before the Court, does not make it possible to establish, subject to the matters to be verified by the referring court, that the competent Bulgarian authorities exceeded the powers available to them under Article\u00a058(2)(f) and (3)(b) of the GDPR and, in particular, that the guidelines at issue do not comply with the principle of proportionality.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring court notes that the guidelines at issue limit, in the case of media representatives, and prohibit, in the case of other participants present at polling stations, the processing of personal data by means of video recording during a specific phase of the electoral process, namely during the opening of ballot boxes and the determination of the election results. By contrast, those guidelines do not appear to limit the ability of participants present at polling stations during the vote count to observe the opening of the ballot boxes and the determination of the election results, thus ensuring the transparency, objectivity and legitimacy of the electoral process, the equal treatment of the participants in the process and the freedom of expression and the right to information, in accordance with the objective of those guidelines.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it must be held that the guidelines at issue are intended, in accordance with the principle of data minimisation referred to in Article\u00a05(1)(c) of the GDPR, to minimise the interference with the right to the protection of personal data caused by video recording the electoral process.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third and last place, it must be borne in mind, so far as is relevant, that Member States may provide for exemptions and derogations from certain provisions of the GDPR in order to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression and information.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a085(1) of the GDPR, Member States are by law to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to that regulation with the right to freedom of expression and information, including the processing of personal data for journalistic purposes. According to Article\u00a085(2) of that regulation, Member States are to provide for exemptions or derogations from certain chapters of the GDPR, including Chapter II, which contains Article\u00a06 of the GDPR. Those exemptions or derogations must be limited to what is necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression and information.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the third to sixth questions is that Article\u00a06(1)(e) and Article\u00a058 of the GDPR must be interpreted as not precluding the competent authorities of a Member State from adopting an administrative measure of general application which provides for the limitation or, where appropriate, the prohibition of video recording during the vote count at polling stations in elections in that Member State.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Eighth Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data in the context of the organisation of elections in a Member State is not excluded from the scope of that regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a06(1)(e) and Article\u00a058 of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that those provisions do not preclude the competent authorities of a Member State from adopting an administrative measure of general application which provides for the limitation or, where appropriate, the prohibition of video recording during the vote count at polling stations in elections in that Member State."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 16 Nov 2023, C-333/22 (\nLigue des droits humains\n)\nLaw Enforcement Directive

secondly, the validity, in the light of the abovementioned provisions of the Charter, of Article\u00a017 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (OJ 2016 L\u00a0119,

personal data between competent authorities of Members States is crucial in order to ensure effective judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation. To that end, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, should be equivalent in all Member States. Effective protection of personal data throughout the [European] Union requires the strengthening of the rights of data subjects and of the obligations of those who process personal data, as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data in the Member States.\n\u2026\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Declaration No\u00a021 on the protection of personal data in the fields of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation, annexed to the final act of the intergovernmental conference which adopted the Treaty of Lisbon, the conference acknowledged that specific rules on the protection of personal data and the free movement of personal data in the fields of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation based on Article\u00a016 TFEU may prove necessary because of the specific nature of those fields.\n\u2026\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A natural person should have the right of access to data which [have] been collected concerning him or her, and to exercise this right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be aware of and verify the lawfulness of the processing.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any restriction of the rights of the data subject must comply with the Charter and with the [Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed at Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950], as interpreted in the case-law of the Court of Justice and by the European Court of Human Rights respectively, and in particular respect the essence of those rights and freedoms.\n\u2026\n(48)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the controller denies a data subject his or her right to information, access to or rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing, the data subject should have the right to request that the national supervisory authority verify the lawfulness of the processing.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The establishment in Member States of supervisory authorities that are able to exercise their functions with complete independence is an essential component of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data. The supervisory authorities should monitor the application of the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and should contribute to their consistent application throughout the Union in order to protect natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure effective, reliable and consistent monitoring of compliance with and enforcement of this Directive throughout the Union pursuant to the TFEU as interpreted by the Court of Justice, the supervisory authorities should have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers, including investigative, corrective, and advisory powers which constitute necessary means to perform their tasks.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every data subject should have the right to lodge a complaint with a single supervisory authority and to an effective judicial remedy in accordance with Article\u00a047 of the Charter where the data subject considers that his or her rights under provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive are infringed or where the supervisory authority does not act on a complaint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses a complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject.\u00a0\u2026\n(86)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each natural or legal person should have the right to an effective judicial remedy before the competent national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which produces legal effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular the exercise of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory authority or the dismissal or rejection of complaints. However, that right does not encompass other measures of supervisory authorities which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice provided by the supervisory authority. Proceedings against a supervisory authority should be brought before the courts of the Member State where the supervisory authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with Member State law. Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before it.\u2019\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01 of that directive, headed \u2018Subject matter and objectives\u2019, provides, in paragraphs\u00a01 and 2 thereof:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive lays down the rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with this Directive, Member States shall:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data; and\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ensure that the exchange of personal data by competent authorities within the Union, where such exchange is required by Union or Member State law, is neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.\u2019\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That directive contains a Chapter III, entitled \u2018Rights of the data subject\u2019, which includes, inter alia, Articles\u00a013 to 17 of the directive.

No appeal was brought against that decision.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 4\u00a0February 2020, BA\u2019s legal adviser requested the OCIP to identify the controllers responsible for processing the personal data at issue and to order them to provide his client with access to all the information concerning him in order to enable him to exercise his rights within an appropriate period.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By email of 6\u00a0February 2020, the OCIP acknowledged receipt of that request. It indicated that BA only had an indirect right of access to those data, while also stating that it was itself going to verify the lawfulness of any data processing in the Banque de donn\u00e9es nationale g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (General National Data Bank), namely the database used by all the national police services. It also stated that it had the power to order the police to erase or amend data, if necessary, and that once the checks had been completed, it would inform BA that the necessary verifications have been carried out.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By email of 22\u00a0June 2020, the OCIP stated as follows to BA\u2019s legal adviser:\n\u2018\u2026\nI inform you, in accordance with Article\u00a042 of [the LPD], that the [OCIP] has carried out the necessary verifications.\nThis means that your client\u2019s personal data have been checked against the police data banks with a view to ensuring the lawfulness of any processing.\nIf necessary, the personal data have been amended or erased.\nAs I informed you in my email of 2\u00a0June, Article\u00a042 of the LPD does not permit the [OCIP] to provide any further information.\u2019\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 2\u00a0September 2020, Ligue des droits humains and BA, on the basis of the second paragraph of Article\u00a0209 of the LPD, submitted an application for interim relief before the tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance francophone de Bruxelles (Brussels Court of First Instance (French-speaking), Belgium).\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, the applicants in the main proceedings requested that court to declare the application for interim relief admissible, and, in the alternative, to refer a question to the Court of Justice on whether, in essence, Article\u00a047(4) of Directive 2016/680, read in the light of recitals\u00a085 and 86 of that directive and in conjunction with Article\u00a08(3) and Article\u00a047 of the Charter, precluded Articles\u00a042 and 71 of the LPD, inasmuch as those provisions did not provide for any judicial remedy against decisions taken by the OCIP.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as to the substance, they requested access to all personal data concerning BA, through the OCIP, and the identification, by the latter, of the controllers and any recipients of those data.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that the court seised were to hold that Article\u00a042(2) of the LPD allowed access to the personal data processed by the police services to be systematically restricted, they requested, in the alternative, that a question be referred to the Court of Justice concerning, in essence, whether Articles\u00a014, 15 and 17 of Directive 2016/680, read in conjunction with Articles\u00a08 and 47 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, were to be interpreted as precluding national legislation allowing a general and systematic derogation from the right of access to personal data where, first, that right was exercised through the supervisory authority and, secondly, that authority could merely state to the data subject that it had carried out all the necessary verifications without informing him or her of the personal data being processed and of the recipients, irrespective of the intended purpose.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By order of 17\u00a0May 2021, the tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance francophone de Bruxelles (Brussels Court of First Instance (French-speaking)) declared that it had \u2018no jurisdiction\u2019 to hear and determine that application for interim relief.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 15\u00a0June 2021, the applicants in the main proceedings brought an appeal against that order before the cour d\u2019appel de Bruxelles (Court of Appeal, Brussels), the referring court. In essence, they reiterated the requests they had made at first instance.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the referring court observes, inter alia, in essence that, in the event that a person does not have the right to exercise in person the rights provided for by Directive 2016/680, the action for an injunction provided for in Article\u00a0209 et seq. of the LPD cannot be put into effect. First, such an action can be brought against the controller, but not against the supervisory authority itself. Secondly, nor can it be exercised by that person, in the present case, BA, against the controller, since the exercise of that person\u2019s rights is entrusted to that authority. Lastly, the very succinct information provided by the OCIP to BA does not enable either BA or a court to determine whether that supervisory authority has exercised BA\u2019s rights correctly. It adds that, although the LPD provides that that action for an injunction is without prejudice to any other judicial, administrative or extra-judicial remedy, any other such remedy sought by BA would encounter the same problems.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the cour d\u2019appel de Bruxelles (Court of Appeal, Brussels) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do Articles\u00a047 and 8(3) of [the Charter] require provision to be made for a judicial remedy against an independent supervisory authority such as the [OCIP] where it exercises the rights of the data subject vis-\u00e0-vis the controller?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does Article\u00a017 of Directive 2016/680 comply with Articles\u00a047 and 8(3) of [the Charter], as interpreted by the Court of Justice, in that it obliges the supervisory authority\u00a0\u2013 which exercises the rights of the data subject vis-\u00e0-vis the controller\u00a0\u2013 only to inform the data subject \u201cthat all necessary verifications or a review by the supervisory authority have taken place\u201d and \u201cof his or her right to seek a judicial remedy\u201d, when such information does not enable any \na posteriori\n review to be conducted as regards the action taken and assessment made by the supervisory authority in the light of the data of the data subject and the obligations of the controller?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling that the questions of the referring court concern the existence, on the basis of Article\u00a053(1) of Directive 2016/680, read in the light of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, of an obligation for the Member States to provide for a right to an effective judicial remedy against the competent national supervisory authority, when a provision of national law is implemented which transposes Article\u00a017 of that directive, according to which, in the cases covered by Article\u00a013(3), Article\u00a015(3) and Article\u00a016(4) of that directive, the rights of the data subject may be exercised through such a supervisory authority.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it must be observed that the answer to that question is dependent on the nature and scope of the task and powers of the supervisory authority in connection with the exercise of the data subject\u2019s rights, provided for in Article\u00a017 of Directive 2016/680. That task and those powers are set out in Article\u00a046(1)(g) and Article\u00a047(1) and (2) of that directive and must be analysed in the light of Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter, which requires that compliance with the rules on the protection of personal data, set out in paragraphs\u00a01 and 2 of Article\u00a08 thereof, is to be subject to control by an independent authority.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the referring court must be understood as asking, in essence, by its first question, whether Article\u00a017 of Directive 2016/680, read in conjunction with Article\u00a046(1)(g), Article\u00a047(1) and (2) and Article\u00a053(1) of that directive, and with Article\u00a08(3) and Article\u00a047 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that, where the rights of a data subject have been exercised, pursuant to Article\u00a017 of that directive, through the competent supervisory authority, that data subject must have available to him or her an effective judicial remedy against that authority.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be recalled at the outset that, under Article\u00a053(1) of Directive 2016/680, Member States must provide for the right of a natural or legal person to an effective judicial remedy against a legally binding decision of a supervisory authority concerning them.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must therefore be determined whether a supervisory authority adopts such a decision where, pursuant to Article\u00a017 of that directive, the rights of the data subject set out by that directive are exercised through that supervisory authority.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this connection, under Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 2016/680, \u2018in the cases referred to in Article\u00a013(3), Article\u00a015(3) and Article\u00a016(4)\u2019 of that directive, Member States are under an obligation to adopt measures \u2018providing that the rights of the data subject may also be exercised through the competent supervisory authority\u2019.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As indicated by the use of the adverb \u2018also\u2019 and as the Advocate General in essence observed in points\u00a041 and 42 of her Opinion, the indirect exercise of the rights of the data subject through the competent supervisory authority, provided for in that provision, is an additional guarantee offered to that data subject that his or her personal data are processed lawfully, where national legislative provisions limit the direct exercise before the controller of the right to receive further information, referred to in Article\u00a013(2) of Directive 2016/680, the right of access to those data, set out in Article\u00a014 of that directive, or of the right to obtain their rectification, erasure or a restriction of processing under the conditions of Article\u00a016(1) to (3) of that directive.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the specific nature of the purposes for which the data processing covered by that directive is carried out, to which attention is drawn, in particular, in recital\u00a010 thereof, Article\u00a013(3) and Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2016/680 authorise the national legislature to limit the direct exercise, on the one hand, of the right to information, and, on the other hand, of the right of access, \u2018to the extent that, and for as long as, such a measure constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society with due regard for the fundamental rights and the legitimate interests of the natural person\u2019, in order to \u2018avoid obstructing official or legal inquiries, investigations or procedures\u2019, \u2018avoid prejudicing the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties\u2019, \u2018protect public security\u2019, \u2018protect national security\u2019 or \u2018protect the rights and freedoms of others\u2019. In addition, Article\u00a015(3) of that directive provides that the controller may omit to inform the data subject of any refusal or restriction of access and of the reasons for the refusal or the restriction where the provision of that information would undermine one of the abovementioned public interest purposes.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, Article\u00a016(4) of that directive authorises the national legislature to restrict the obligation on the controller to \u2018inform the data subject in writing of any refusal of rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing and of the reasons for the refusal\u2019 for the same public interest purposes, \u2018to the extent that such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society with due regard for the fundamental rights and legitimate interests of the natural person concerned\u2019.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in that context, as is apparent from recital\u00a048 of that directive, the indirect exercise of the rights referred to in paragraph\u00a041 above through the competent supervisory authority must be regarded as necessary for the protection of those rights, their direct exercise before the controller being difficult or even impossible.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, Article\u00a046(1)(g) of Directive 2016/680 requires that each competent national authority must be entrusted with the task of checking the lawfulness of processing pursuant to Article\u00a017 of that directive, that is to say following a request made on the basis of the latter provision.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it is apparent, inter alia, from Article\u00a047(1) and (2) of that directive that each supervisory authority must have, under the national legislation, not only \u2018effective investigative powers\u2019 but also \u2018effective corrective powers\u2019.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those provisions must be read in the light of the requirement stated in Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter, that compliance with the rules on the right of everyone to the protection of personal data, set out in paragraphs\u00a01 and 2 of that article, must be \u2018subject to control by an independent authority\u2019, and, in particular, the requirement set out in the second sentence of paragraph\u00a02 thereof, that \u2018everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified\u2019. As is confirmed by settled case-law, the establishment of an independent supervisory authority is intended to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of the monitoring of compliance with the rules concerning protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and must be interpreted in the light of that aim (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0229 and the case-law cited).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, where such a supervisory authority acts in order to ensure the exercise of the rights of the data subject on the basis of Article\u00a017 of Directive 2016/680, its task falls entirely within the definition, in EU primary law, of its role, since that definition entails, inter alia, the monitoring of compliance with the data subject\u2019s rights of access and of rectification. It follows that, in accomplishing that specific task, as with any other task, the supervisory authority must be able to exercise the powers which are conferred on it under Article\u00a047 of that directive by acting with complete independence, in accordance with the Charter and as stated in recital\u00a075 of that directive.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, at the end of the verification of the lawfulness of processing, the competent supervisory authority must, under the first sentence of Article\u00a017(3) of that directive, inform the data subject \u2018at least that all necessary verifications or a review by the supervisory authority have taken place\u2019.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As observed, in essence, by the Advocate General in point\u00a065 of her Opinion, it must be inferred from all those provisions that, when the competent supervisory authority informs the data subject of the result of the verifications made, it brings to his or her knowledge the decision it has made in his or her regard to close the verification process, that decision necessarily affecting the legal position of the data subject. That decision therefore constitutes a \u2018legally binding decision\u2019 with regard to the data subject, within the meaning of Article\u00a053(1) of Directive 2016/680, irrespective of whether and to what extent that authority has found the processing of the data concerning that subject to be lawful or adopted corrective measures.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, recital\u00a086 of that directive states that the concept of \u2018legally binding decision\u2019 within the meaning of that directive must be understood as referring to a decision which produces legal effects concerning the data subject, in particular, a decision concerning the exercise of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory authority or concerning the dismissal or rejection of complaints.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the data subject must be able to obtain judicial review of the merits of such a decision on the basis of Article\u00a053(1) of Directive 2016/680, and, in particular, of the manner in which the supervisory authority performed its obligation, resulting from Article\u00a017 of that directive and to which Article\u00a046(1)(g) of that directive refers, to carry out \u2018all necessary verifications\u2019 and, as the case may be, exercised its corrective powers.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion is, moreover, borne out by recital\u00a085 of Directive 2016/680, from which it is apparent that any data subject should have the right to an effective judicial remedy against a supervisory authority where that authority \u2018does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject\u2019.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, such an interpretation is in accordance with Article\u00a047 of the Charter, since, as is apparent from settled case-law, that right must be must be accorded to any person relying on rights or freedoms guaranteed by EU law against a decision adversely affecting him or her which is such as to undermine those rights or freedoms (see, to that effect, judgment of 26\u00a0January 2023, \nMinisterstvo na vatreshnite raboti (Recording of biometric and genetic data by the police)\n, C-205/21, EU:C:2023:49, paragraph\u00a087 and the case-law cited).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a017 of Directive 2016/680, read in conjunction with Article\u00a046(1)(g), Article\u00a047(1) and (2) and Article\u00a053(1) of that directive, and with Article\u00a08(3) and Article\u00a047 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that where the rights of a data subject have been exercised, pursuant to Article\u00a017 of that directive, through the competent supervisory authority and that authority informs that data subject of the result of the verifications carried out, that data subject must have an effective judicial remedy against the decision of that authority to close the verification process.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a017(3) of Directive 2016/680 is valid having regard to Article\u00a08(3) and Article\u00a047 of the Charter in so far as it obliges the supervisory authority only to inform the data subject (i) that all necessary verifications or a review by the supervisory authority have taken place and (ii) that that person has a right to seek a judicial remedy, since such information does not allow any judicial review of the action taken and the assessment made by the supervisory authority, in the light of the data processed and of the obligations of the controller.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, it should be noted in this respect that, in accordance with a general principle of interpretation, an EU act must be interpreted, as far as possible, in such a way as not to affect its validity and in conformity with primary law as a whole and, in particular, with the provisions of the Charter. Thus, if the wording of secondary EU legislation is open to more than one interpretation, preference should be given to the interpretation which renders the provision consistent with primary law rather than to the interpretation which leads to its being incompatible with primary law (judgment of 21\u00a0June 2022, \nLigue des droits humains\n, C-817/19, EU:C:2022:491, paragraph\u00a086 and the case-law cited).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, the right to an effective judicial remedy, guaranteed in Article\u00a047 of the Charter, requires, in principle, that the person concerned must be able to ascertain the reasons on which the decision taken in relation to him or her is based, so as to make it possible for him or her to defend his or her rights in the best possible conditions and to decide, with full knowledge of the relevant facts, whether there is any point in his or her applying to the court with jurisdiction, and in order to put the latter fully in a position in which it may carry out the review of the lawfulness of that decision (see, to that effect, judgment of 4\u00a0June 2013, \nZZ\n, C-300/11, EU:C:2013:363, paragraph\u00a053 and the case-law cited).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although that right is not an absolute right and, in accordance with Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, limitations may be placed upon it, that is on condition that those limitations are provided for by law, they respect the essence of the rights and freedoms at issue and, in compliance with the principle of proportionality, they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others (judgment of 26\u00a0January 2023, \nMinisterstvo na vatreshnite raboti (Recording of biometric and genetic data by the police)\n, C-205/21, EU:C:2023:49, paragraph\u00a089 and the case-law cited).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it must be observed that, so far as concerns the decision of the competent supervisory authority identified in paragraph\u00a050 above, Article\u00a017(3) of Directive 2016/680 establishes, with respect to that supervisory authority, an obligation to provide a minimum of information, providing that it is to inform the data subject \u2018at least that all necessary verifications or a review by the supervisory authority have taken place\u2019 and of \u2018his or her right to seek a judicial remedy\u2019.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, since that provision does not preclude, in certain situations, in accordance with the rules adopted by the national legislature to implement it, the supervisory authority from being able, or even obliged, to confine itself to providing the minimum information referred to in the preceding paragraph, without any other details, in particular where those rules seek to avoid compromising the public interest purposes provided for in Article\u00a013(3), Article\u00a015(1) and Article\u00a016(4) of that directive, as set out in paragraphs\u00a042 and 43 above, it is liable to give rise to a limitation on the right to an effective judicial remedy, guaranteed in Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, in the first place, it must be noted that such a limitation is expressly provided for by Directive 2016/680 and that it therefore complies with the condition laid down in Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, according to which any limitation on the exercise of a fundamental right must be \u2018provided for by law\u2019.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, the fact that Article\u00a017(3) of Directive 2016/680 allows Member States to restrict, in certain cases, the statement of reasons for that decision to the minimum particulars set out in that provision, does not mean, as the Advocate General in essence states in point\u00a089 of her Opinion, that it is possible in all circumstances to reduce the information provided to the data subject to solely those particulars.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That provision must be interpreted in the light of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, so that the other criteria set out in that latter provision must be satisfied. That means holding that Article\u00a017(3) of that directive requires Member States to ensure that the provisions of national law implementing it, first, respect the essence of the data subject\u2019s right to effective judicial protection and, secondly, are based on a weighing up of the public interest purposes warranting limitation of that information and of the fundamental rights and legitimate interests of that data subject, in accordance with the principles of necessity and of proportionality, like the weighing up which must be carried out by the national legislature when it implements the limitations provided for in Article\u00a013(3), Article\u00a015(3) and Article\u00a016(4) of that directive.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, where (i) it is required by the protection of the right of the data subject to an effective judicial remedy against the decision to close the verification process and (ii) it is not precluded by the public interest purposes referred to in Article\u00a013(3), Article\u00a015(3) and Article\u00a016(4) of Directive 2016/680, the onus is on the Member States to provide that the information disclosed to the data subject may go beyond the minimum information provided for by Article\u00a017(3) of that directive, so as to make it possible for him or her to defend his or her rights and to decide, with full knowledge of the facts, whether there is any point in him or her applying to the court with jurisdiction.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, the national measures implementing that latter provision must, to the extent possible, leave a degree of discretion to the competent supervisory authority, in accordance with the independence characterising such an authority under Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter, to determine whether the framework established by the national legislation in line with the requirements noted in paragraph\u00a065 above precludes it from communicating to that data subject, at least in brief, the result of its verifications and any corrective measures which it has taken. In this connection, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in points\u00a073 and 74 of her Opinion, it is for that authority, in compliance with that national legislative framework, to engage in a confidential dialogue with the controller and, at the end of that dialogue, to decide on which information is necessary for the data subject to exercise his or her right to an effective judicial remedy and may be communicated to him or her without compromising the public interest purposes referred to in paragraph\u00a065 above.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, should that framework require that the information provided by the supervisory authority be limited to that provided for in Article\u00a017(3) of Directive 2016/680, it is nevertheless for the Member States, in the exercise of their procedural autonomy, to implement the measures necessary to guarantee, in accordance with Article\u00a053(1) of that directive, an effective judicial review both of the existence and of the merits of the reasons which warranted the limitation on that information and of the correct execution, by the supervisory authority, of its task of verifying the lawfulness of the processing. In that regard, the concept of \u2018effective judicial remedy\u2019 referred to in the latter provision must be read in the light of recital\u00a086 of that directive, under which the courts before which actions against a supervisory authority are brought \u2018should exercise full jurisdiction which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before it\u2019.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, Member States must ensure that the court with jurisdiction has at its disposal and applies techniques and rules of procedural law which accommodate, on the one hand, legitimate considerations in relation to the public interest purposes referred to in Article\u00a013(3), Article\u00a015(3) and Article\u00a016(4) of Directive 2016/680, those purposes having been taken into consideration by the national legislation to limit the information provided to the data subject and, on the other hand, the need to ensure sufficient compliance with the data subject\u2019s procedural rights, such as the right to be heard and the adversarial principle (see, to that effect, judgment of 4\u00a0June 2013, \nZZ\n, C-300/11, EU:C:2013:363, paragraph\u00a057 and the case-law cited).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the context of the judicial review of the correct application of Article\u00a017 of that directive by the supervisory authority, it is incumbent upon the Member States to lay down rules enabling the court with jurisdiction to examine both all the grounds and the related evidence on the basis of which that authority based, within that framework, the verification of the lawfulness of the processing of the data at issue as well as the conclusions which it drew from that verification (see, to that effect, judgment of 4\u00a0June 2013, \nZZ\n, C-300/11, EU:C:2013:363, paragraph\u00a059 and the case-law cited).\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as the European Parliament noted in its observations, Article\u00a015(4) of Directive 2016/680 provides that the controller must document the factual or legal reasons on which it has based the decision by which it limited, wholly or partly, the rights of access of the data subject and that that information must be made available to the supervisory authorities. As that institution suggested, that provision, read in conjunction with Articles\u00a017 and 53 of that directive and in the light of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, as interpreted by the case-law recalled in paragraphs\u00a068 and 69 above, implies that that information must also be made available to the court before which an action against the supervisory authority has been brought, seeking review of the correct application of Article\u00a017 of that directive.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it is apparent from paragraphs\u00a063 to 70 above that the limitation provided for in Article\u00a017 of Directive 2016/680 respects the essence of the data subject\u2019s right to an effective judicial remedy against the supervisory authority\u2019s decision to close the procedure provided for in that provision and the principles of necessity and proportionality, in accordance with Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, it must be concluded that the examination of the second question has revealed nothing capable of affecting the validity of Article\u00a017(3) of Directive 2016/680.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a017 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA, read in conjunction with Article\u00a046(1)(g), Article\u00a047(1) and (2) and Article\u00a053(1) of that directive and with Article\u00a08(3) and Article\u00a047 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nmust be interpreted as meaning that where the rights of a data subject have been exercised, pursuant to Article\u00a017 of that directive, through the competent supervisory authority and that authority informs that data subject of the result of the verifications carried out, that data subject must have an effective judicial remedy against the decision of that authority to close the verification process.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe examination of the second question has revealed nothing capable of affecting the validity of Article\u00a017(3) of Directive 2016/680."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f),

Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 7 Dec 2023, C-26/22 (\nSCHUFA Holding\n)\nGeneral data protection law \n >

Such legitimate interest could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. In such a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is required.\u00a0\u2026 In order to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the controller, after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing, should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their further use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing operations.\n\u2026\n(98)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Associations or other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors should be encouraged to draw up codes of conduct, within the limits of this Regulation, so as to facilitate the effective application of this Regulation, taking account of the specific characteristics of the processing carried out in certain sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium enterprises. In particular, such codes of conduct could calibrate the obligations of controllers and processors, taking into account the risk likely to result from the processing for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.\n\u2026\n(141)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every data subject should have the right to lodge a complaint with a single supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, and the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance with Article\u00a047 of the Charter if the data subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed or where the supervisory authority does not act on a complaint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses a complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject. The investigation following a complaint should be carried out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific case. The supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(143)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 [E]ach natural or legal person should have an effective judicial remedy before the competent national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which produces legal effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular the exercise of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory authority or the dismissal or rejection of complaints. However, the right to an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory authorities which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice provided by the supervisory authority. Proceedings against a supervisory authority should be brought before the courts of the Member State where the supervisory authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with that Member State\u2019s procedural law. Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them.\nWhere a complaint has been rejected or dismissed by a supervisory authority, the complainant may bring proceedings before the courts in the same Member State. In the context of judicial remedies relating to the application of this Regulation, national courts which consider a decision on the question necessary to enable them to give judgment, may, or in the case provided for in Article\u00a0267 TFEU, must, request the Court of Justice to give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Union law, including this Regulation.\u00a0\u2026\u2019\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Entitled \u2018Principles relating to processing of personal data\u2019, Article\u00a05 of that regulation is worded as follows:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Personal data shall be:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (\u201clawfulness, fairness and transparency\u201d);\n\u2026\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (\u201cdata minimisation\u201d);\n\u2026\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph\u00a01 (\u201caccountability\u201d).\u2019\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Headed \u2018Lawfulness of processing\u2019, Article\u00a06 of that regulation provides:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:\n\u2026\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\u2026\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject\u2019s consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article\u00a023(1), the controller shall, in order to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take into account, inter alia:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended further processing;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to Article\u00a09, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article\u00a010;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.\u2019\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Entitled \u2018Right to erasure (\u201cright to be forgotten\u201d)\u2019, Article\u00a017 of the GDPR provides, in paragraph\u00a01 thereof:\n\u2018The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies:\n\u2026\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article\u00a021(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article\u00a021(2);\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the personal data have been unlawfully processed;\n\u2026\u2019 \n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Entitled \u2018Right to object\u2019, Article\u00a021 of that regulation provides, in paragraphs\u00a01 and 2 thereof:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point\u00a0(e) or (f) of Article\u00a06(1), including profiling based on those provisions.

heading \u2018Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority\u2019, Article\u00a077 of that regulation states:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to any other

Regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint

authority pursuant to Article\u00a077, each data subject shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy where he or she considers that his or her rights under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of his or her personal data in non-compliance with this Regulation.\u2019\n\u00a0\nGerman law\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Paragraph\u00a09(1) of the Insolvenzordnung (Insolvency Code) of 5 October 1994 (BGBl. 1994 I, p. 2866), in the version applicable to the facts in the main proceedings:\n\u2018Public notification shall take place by means of centralised publication at national level on the internet; this may be done in extract form. The debtor must be precisely identified, and, in particular, his or her address and business sector must be stated. Notification is deemed to have been effected after two further days following the day of publication have elapsed.\u2019\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph\u00a03 of the Verordnung zu \u00f6ffentlichen Bekanntmachungen in Insolvenzverfahren im Internet (Regulation on public notifications in insolvency proceedings on the internet) of 12\u00a0February 2002 (BGBl. I, p.\u00a0677; \u2018the InsoBekV\u2019) stipulates, in subparagraphs 1 and 2 thereof:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The publication of data from insolvency proceedings, including preliminary insolvency proceedings, in an electronic information and communication system shall be erased no later than six months after the insolvency proceedings are terminated or the order discontinuing the insolvency proceedings becomes final. If the proceedings are not opened, the period shall begin to run from the date on which the published protective measures are lifted.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first sentence of subparagraph 1 shall apply to publications in the proceedings for a discharge from remaining debts, including the order pursuant to Paragraph\u00a0289 of the Insolvency Code, subject to the proviso that the period begins to run from the date on which the decision on discharge from remaining debts becomes final.\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe disputes in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the context of insolvency proceedings concerning them, UF and AB were granted early discharge from remaining debts by judicial decisions delivered on 17\u00a0December 2020 and 23\u00a0March 2021 respectively. In accordance with Paragraph\u00a09(1) of the Insolvenzordnung and Paragraph\u00a03(1) and (2) of the InsoBekV, the official publication of those decisions on the internet was discontinued after six months.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SCHUFA is a private credit information agency, which records and stores information from public registers in its own databases, in particular information relating to the discharge from remaining debts. It deletes that information three years after registration, in accordance with the code of conduct drawn up in Germany by the association of agencies providing credit information and approved by the competent supervisory authority.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0UF and AB applied to SCHUFA to have the entries relating to the decisions to discharge their remaining debts deleted. That agency refused to accede to their requests, after explaining that its activity was carried out in compliance with the GDPR and that the six-month deletion period provided for in Paragraph\u00a03(1) of the InsoBekV did not apply to it.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0UF and AB each lodged a complaint with the HBDI as the competent supervisory authority.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In decisions issued on 1\u00a0March 2021 and 9\u00a0July 2021 respectively, the HBDI found that SCHUFA\u2019s data processing was lawful.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0UF and AB each brought an action against the decision of the HBDI before the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court, Wiesbaden, Germany), the referring court. In support of their actions, they argued that the HBDI was obliged, within the scope of its duties and powers, to take measures in respect of SCHUFA to enforce deletion of the entries concerning them.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its defence, the HBDI argued that the actions should be dismissed.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the HBDI argued that the right to lodge a complaint, provided for in Article\u00a077(1) of the GDPR, is conceived solely as a right of petition. Thus, judicial review would be confined to examining whether the supervisory authority handled the complaint and informed the complainant of the progress and outcome of that complaint. By contrast, it is not the responsibility of the court hearing the case to review the substantive correctness of the decision handed down in response to the complaint.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, the HBDI emphasised that data to which credit information agencies have access may be stored for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which they were stored. In the absence of regulation by the national legislature, codes of conduct have been adopted by the supervisory authorities, and the one drawn up by the association of credit information agencies provides for the deletion of such data exactly three years after entry in the file.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in the first place, the referring court considers it necessary to clarify the legal nature of the decision made by the supervisory authority after receiving a complaint under Article\u00a077(1) of the GDPR.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, that court has doubts about the HBDI\u2019s line of argument, since it would undermine the effectiveness of the judicial remedy referred to in Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR. In addition, having regard to the objective pursued by that regulation, which is to ensure, in the implementation of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, effective protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, Articles\u00a077 and 78 of the GDPR cannot be interpreted restrictively.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court advocates an interpretation according to which the decision taken on the merits by the supervisory authority must be subject to full judicial review. However, that authority has both a degree of latitude and discretionary power, and may only be required to act where lawful options cannot be identified.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, the referring court raises the question, in two respects, of the lawfulness of the storage by credit information agencies of data relating to a person\u2019s solvency from public registers, such as the insolvency register.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, there are doubts as to the lawfulness of a private agency such as SCHUFA storing data transferred from public registers in its own databases.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, that storage does not take place in relation to a specific reason, but rather in the event that their contractual partners ask them for such information, and ultimately results in the data being retained, especially if the data have already been deleted from the public register because the retention period has expired.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, processing and therefore retention of data is authorised only if one of the conditions set out in Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR is met. In this case, only the condition set out in point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR is relevant. It is doubtful whether a credit information agency such as SCHUFA is pursuing a legitimate interest within the meaning of that provision.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, SCHUFA is only one of several credit information agencies and, consequently, data are often stored in multiple databases in Germany, entailing a massive encroachment on the fundamental right under Article\u00a07 of the Charter.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, even supposing that the storage by private agencies of data from public registers were lawful as such, the question of the possible duration of such storage arises.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring court is of the view that those private agencies should be required to comply with the six-month time limit laid down in Paragraph\u00a03 of the InsoBekV relating to the retention in the insolvency register of decisions to discharge remaining debts. Thus, data which must be deleted from the public register would also have to be simultaneously deleted at all private credit information agencies which have stored those data.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the question arises as to whether a code of conduct approved in accordance with Article\u00a040 of the GDPR, which provides for a three-year deletion period for the entry relating to the discharge from remaining debts, should be taken into account in the balancing exercise to be carried out in the context of the assessment under point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court, Wiesbaden) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a077(1) of [the GDPR], read in conjunction with Article\u00a078(1) thereof, to be understood as meaning that the outcome that the supervisory authority reaches and notifies to the data subject:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has the character of a decision on a petition? This would mean that judicial review of a decision on a complaint taken by a supervisory authority in accordance with Article\u00a078(1) of that regulation is, in principle, limited to the question of whether the authority has handled the complaint, investigated the subject matter of the complaint to the extent appropriate and informed the complainant of the outcome of the investigation,\nor\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0is to be understood as a decision on the merits taken by a public authority? This would mean that a decision on a complaint taken by a supervisory authority would be subject to a full substantive review by the court in accordance with Article\u00a078(1) of that regulation, whereby, in individual cases\u00a0\u2013 for example where discretion is reduced to zero\u00a0\u2013 the supervisory authority may also be obliged by the court to take a specific measure within the meaning of Article\u00a058 of that same regulation?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the storage of data at a private credit information agency, where personal data from a public register, such as the \u201cnational databases\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a079(4) and (5) of Regulation [2015/848] are stored without a specific reason in order to be able to provide information in the event of a request, compatible with Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the [Charter]?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are private databases (in particular databases of a credit information agency) which exist in parallel with, and are set up in addition to, the State databases and in which the data from the latter (\nin casu\n, insolvency announcements) are stored for longer than the period provided for within the narrow framework of Regulation 2015/848, read in conjunction with the national law, permissible in principle?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question 3a is answered in the affirmative, does it follow from the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d under Article\u00a017(1)(d) of [the GDPR] that such data must be deleted where the processing period provided for in respect of the public register has expired?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as point\u00a0(f) of [the first subparagraph of] Article\u00a06(1) of [the GDPR] enters into consideration as the sole legal basis for the storage of data at private credit information agencies with regard to data also stored in public registers, is a credit information agency already to be regarded as pursuing a legitimate interest in the case where it imports data from the public register without a specific reason so that those data are then available in the event of a request?\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it permissible for codes of conduct which have been approved by the supervisory authorities in accordance with Article\u00a040 of [the GDPR], and which provide for time limits for review and erasure that exceed the retention periods for public registers, to suspend the balancing of interests prescribed under point\u00a0(f) of [the first subparagraph of] Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation?\u2019\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of the President of the Court of 11\u00a0February 2022, Cases C-26/22 and C-64/22 were joined for the purposes of the written and oral parts of the procedure and of the judgment.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that judicial review of a decision on a complaint taken by a supervisory authority is limited to the question whether that authority has handled the complaint, investigated the subject matter of the complaint to the extent appropriate and informed the complainant of the outcome of the investigation, or whether that decision is subject to a full judicial review, including the power of the court seised to require the supervisory authority to take a specific measure.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer that question, it should be borne in mind, as a preliminary point, that the interpretation of a provision of EU law requires that account be taken not only of its wording, but also of its context and the objectives and purpose pursued by the act of which it forms part (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2023, \nPankki S\n, \nC-579/21, EU:C:2023:501, paragraph\u00a038 and the case-law cited).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In respect of the wording of Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR, that provision provides that, without prejudice to any other administrative or non-judicial remedy, each natural or legal person is to have the right to an effective judicial remedy against a legally binding decision of a supervisory authority concerning them.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it should be noted from the outset that, in the present case, the decisions adopted by the HBDI constitute legally binding decisions within the meaning of Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR. After examining the merits of the complaints lodged with it, that authority found that the processing of personal data challenged by the applicants in the main proceedings was lawful under the GDPR. Moreover, the legally binding nature of those decisions is confirmed by recital\u00a0143 of that regulation, according to which the dismissal or rejection of a complaint by a supervisory authority constitutes a decision producing legal effects with regard to the complainant.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that that provision, read in the light of recital\u00a0141 of the GDPR, explicitly states that any data subject has the right to an \u2018effective\u2019 judicial remedy, in accordance with Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the Court has already held that it follows from Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital\u00a0143 of that regulation, that courts seised of an action against a decision of a supervisory authority should exercise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them (judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \nNemzeti Adatv\u00e9delmi \u00e9s Inform\u00e1ci\u00f3szabads\u00e1g Hat\u00f3s\u00e1g\n, C-132/21, EU:C:2023:2, paragraph\u00a041).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR cannot be interpreted as meaning that judicial review of a decision on a complaint taken by a supervisory authority is limited to the question of whether the authority has handled the complaint, investigated the subject matter of the complaint to the extent appropriate and informed the complainant of the outcome of the investigation. On the contrary, for a judicial remedy to be \u2018effective\u2019, as required by that provision, such a decision must be subject to full judicial review.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is supported by the context of Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR and by the objectives and purpose of the regulation.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the context surrounding that provision, it is important to note that, in accordance with Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter and Article\u00a051(1) and Article\u00a057(1)(a) of the GDPR, the national supervisory authorities are responsible for monitoring compliance with the EU rules concerning the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data (judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0107).\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, under Article\u00a057(1)(f) of the GDPR, each supervisory authority is required on its territory to handle complaints which, in accordance with Article\u00a077(1) of that regulation, any data subject is entitled to lodge where that data subject considers that the processing of his or her personal data infringes the regulation, and is required to examine the nature of that complaint as necessary. The supervisory authority must deal with such a complaint with all due diligence (judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0109).\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to handle complaints lodged, Article\u00a058(1) of the GDPR confers extensive investigative powers on each supervisory authority. Where, following its investigation, such an authority finds an infringement of the provisions of that regulation, it is required to react appropriately in order to remedy the shortcoming found. To that end, Article\u00a058(2) of that regulation lists the various corrective measures that the supervisory authority may adopt (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0111).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a042 of his Opinion, that the complaints procedure, which is not similar to that of a petition, is designed as a mechanism capable of effectively safeguarding the rights and interests of data subjects.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in view of the wide-ranging powers vested in the supervisory authority under the GDPR, the requirement for effective judicial protection would not be met if decisions concerning the exercise by such a supervisory authority of powers of investigation or the adoption of corrective measures were subject only to limited judicial review.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same applies to decisions rejecting a complaint, as Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR makes no distinction according to the nature of the decision adopted by the supervisory authority.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objectives pursued by the GDPR, it is apparent, in particular, from recital\u00a010 thereof that the aim of that regulation is to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data within the European Union. Moreover, recital\u00a011 of that regulation states that effective protection of such data requires the strengthening of the rights of data subjects.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Article\u00a078(1) of that regulation were to be interpreted as meaning that the judicial review referred to therein is limited to verifying whether the supervisory authority has handled the complaint, investigated the subject matter of the complaint to the extent appropriate and informed the complainant of the outcome of the investigation, the attainment of the objectives and the pursuit of the purpose of the regulation would necessarily be compromised.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, an interpretation of that provision according to which a decision on a complaint adopted by a supervisory authority is subject to full judicial review does not call into question the guarantees of independence enjoyed by supervisory authorities, nor the right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it is true that, in accordance with Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter, compliance with the rules on the protection of personal data is subject to control by an independent authority. In that context, Article\u00a052 of the GDPR specifies, in particular, that each supervisory authority is to act with complete independence in performing its tasks and exercising its powers in accordance with that regulation (paragraph\u00a01), that, in the performance of their tasks and exercise of their powers, the member or members of each supervisory authority are to remain free from external influence (paragraph\u00a02), and that each Member State is to ensure that each supervisory authority has the resources necessary for the effective performance of its duties and the exercise of its powers (paragraph\u00a04).\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, those guarantees of independence are in no way compromised by the fact that the legally binding decisions of a supervisory authority are subject to full judicial review.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards the right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor provided for in Article\u00a079(1) of the GDPR, it should be noted that, according to the case-law of the Court, the remedies provided for, respectively, in Article\u00a078(1) and Article\u00a079(1) of that regulation may be exercised concurrently with and independently of each other (judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \nNemzeti Adatv\u00e9delmi \u00e9s Inform\u00e1ci\u00f3szabads\u00e1g Hat\u00f3s\u00e1g\n, C-132/21, EU:C:2023:2, paragraph\u00a035 and operative part). In that context, the Court has held, inter alia, that making several remedies available strengthens the objective set out in recital\u00a0141 of that regulation of guaranteeing for every data subject who considers that his or her rights under that regulation are infringed the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance with Article\u00a047 of the Charter (judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \nNemzeti Adatv\u00e9delmi \u00e9s Inform\u00e1ci\u00f3szabads\u00e1g Hat\u00f3s\u00e1g\n, C-132/21, EU:C:2023:2, paragraph\u00a044).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, and even though it is for the Member States, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy, to lay down the detailed rules for the coordination of those remedies (judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \nNemzeti Adatv\u00e9delmi \u00e9s Inform\u00e1ci\u00f3szabads\u00e1g Hat\u00f3s\u00e1g\n, C-132/21, EU:C:2023:2, paragraph\u00a045 and operative part), the existence of the right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor, provided for in Article\u00a079(1) of the GDPR, does not affect the scope of the judicial review exercised, in the context of an action brought under Article\u00a078(1) of that regulation, over a decision on a complaint adopted by a supervisory authority.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it should be added that, while, as pointed out in paragraph\u00a056 of this judgment, the supervisory authority must deal with a complaint with all due diligence, that authority has, as regards the remedies listed in Article\u00a058(2) of the GDPR, a margin of discretion as to the choice of appropriate and necessary means (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0112).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the national court hearing an action under Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR must, as noted in paragraph\u00a052 of this judgment, have full jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relating to the dispute concerned, the guarantee of effective judicial protection does not imply that it is entitled to substitute its assessment of the choice of appropriate and necessary remedies for that of that authority, but requires that court to examine whether the supervisory authority has complied with the limits of its discretion.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that a decision on a complaint adopted by a supervisory authority is subject to full judicial review.\n\u00a0\nThe second to fifth questions\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second to fifth questions, which it is appropriate to consider together, the referring court asks, in essence,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whether Article\u00a05(1)(a) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, must be interpreted as precluding a practice of private credit information agencies consisting in retaining, in their own databases, information from a public register relating to the grant of a discharge from remaining debts in favour of natural persons, and in deleting that information after a period of three years, in accordance with a code of conduct within the meaning of Article\u00a040 of that regulation, whereas the period of retention of that information in the public register is six months, and,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whether Article\u00a017(1)(c) and (d) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that a private credit information agency which has acquired information relating to the grant of a discharge from remaining debts from a public register is obliged to delete that information.\n\u00a0\nArticle\u00a05(1)(a) of the GDPR\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a05(1)(a) of the GDPR provides that personal data is to be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of the cases in which processing of personal data can be regarded as lawful. Thus, in order to be capable of being regarded as such, processing must fall within one of the cases provided for in that provision (judgment of 4\u00a0July 2023, \nMeta Platforms and Others \n(General terms of use of a social network)\n, C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph\u00a090 and the case-law cited).\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is common ground that the lawfulness of the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings must be assessed solely in the light of point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR. Under that provision, the processing of personal data is lawful only if and to the extent that it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, that provision lays down three cumulative conditions for the processing of personal data to be lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by a third party; second, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and third, that the interests or freedoms and fundamental rights of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence (judgment of 4\u00a0July 2023, \nMeta Platforms and Others \n(General terms of use of a social network)\n, C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph\u00a0106 and the case-law cited).\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, first, the condition relating to the pursuit of a \u2018legitimate interest\u2019, in the absence of a definition of that concept in the GDPR, it should be emphasised, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a061 of his Opinion, that a wide range of interests is, in principle, capable of being regarded as legitimate.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, with regard to the condition that the processing of personal data be necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued, that condition requires the referring court to ascertain that the legitimate data processing interests pursued cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter (judgment of 4\u00a0July 2023, \nMeta Platforms and Others \n(General terms of use of a social network)\n, C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph\u00a0108 and the case-law cited).\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should also be recalled that the condition relating to the need for processing must be examined in conjunction with the \u2018data minimisation\u2019 principle enshrined in Article\u00a05(1)(c) of the GDPR, in accordance with which personal data must be \u2018adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed\u2019 (judgment of 4\u00a0July 2023, \nMeta Platforms and Others \n(General terms of use of a social network)\n, C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph\u00a0109 and the case-law cited).\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, with regard to the condition that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence over the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party, the Court has already held that that condition entails a balancing of the opposing rights and interests at issue which depends in principle on the specific circumstances of the particular case and that, consequently, it is for the referring court to carry out that balancing exercise, taking account of those specific circumstances (judgment of 4\u00a0July 2023, \nMeta Platforms and Others \n(General terms of use of a social network)\n, C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph\u00a0110 and the case-law cited).\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as can be seen from recital\u00a047 of the GDPR, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject may in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect such processing (judgment of 4\u00a0July 2023, \nMeta Platforms and Others \n(General terms of use of a social network)\n, C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph\u00a0112).\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While it is therefore ultimately for the national court to assess whether, in relation to the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings, the three conditions referred to in paragraph\u00a075 of this judgment are satisfied, it is open to the Court, when giving a preliminary ruling on a reference, to give clarifications to guide the national court in that determination (see, to that effect, judgment of 20\u00a0October 2022, \nDigi\n, C-77/21, EU:C:2022:805, paragraph\u00a039 and the case-law cited).\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, with regard to the pursuit of a legitimate interest, SCHUFA argues that credit information agencies process the data necessary for the assessment of the creditworthiness of persons or undertakings in order to be able to make that information available to their contractual partners. In addition to protecting the economic interests of agencies wishing to enter into credit-linked contracts, the determination of creditworthiness and the provision of information on creditworthiness form the basis of credit and the economy\u2019s ability to function. The activity of those agencies also helps to clarify the business requirements of persons involved in credit-related transactions as the report allows a quick and non-bureaucratic examination of those transactions.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, while the processing of personal data such as that at issue in the main proceedings serves SCHUFA\u2019s economic interests, that processing also serves to pursue the legitimate interest of SCHUFA\u2019s contractual partners, who intend to conclude credit agreements with individuals, in being able to assess the creditworthiness of those individuals, and thus the interests of the credit sector from a socio-economic point of view.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case of consumer credit agreements, Article\u00a08 of Directive 2008/48, read in the light of recital\u00a028 thereof, states that, before the conclusion of the credit agreement, the creditor is required to assess the consumer\u2019s creditworthiness on the basis of sufficient information, including, where appropriate, information from public and private databases.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as regards consumer credit agreements relating to residential immovable property, it follows from Articles\u00a018(1) and 21(1) of Directive 2014/17, read in the light of recitals\u00a055 and 59 thereof, that the creditor must make a thorough assessment of the consumer\u2019s creditworthiness and that he or she must have access to credit databases, the consultation of such databases being a useful element for the purposes of that assessment.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be added that the obligation to assess the creditworthiness of consumers, as laid down in Directives 2008/48 and 2014/17, is intended not only to protect the credit applicant but also, as pointed out in recital\u00a026 of Directive 2008/48, to ensure the proper functioning of the credit system as a whole.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the data processing must also be necessary in order to achieve the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party and the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the data subject must not override those interests. In the context of that balancing of the opposing rights and interests at issue, namely, those of the controller and of the third parties involved, on the one hand, and those of the data subject, on the other, account must be taken, as has been noted in paragraph\u00a080 of this judgment, in particular of the reasonable expectations of the data subject as well as the scale of the processing at issue and its impact on that person (see judgment of 4\u00a0July 2023, \nMeta Platforms and Others \n(General terms of use of a social network)\n, C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph\u00a0116).\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, the Court has held that that provision must be interpreted as meaning that processing can be regarded as necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, within the meaning of that provision, only if such processing is carried out in so far as is strictly necessary for the purposes of that legitimate interest and if it is apparent from a balancing of the opposing interests, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, that the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the persons concerned by the processing at issue do not override that legitimate interest of the controller or of a third party (see, to that effect, judgments of 4\u00a0May 2017, \nR\u012bgas satiksme\n, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph\u00a030, and of 4\u00a0July 2023, \nMeta Platforms and Others \n(General terms of use of a social network)\n, C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph\u00a0126).\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the referring court refers to two aspects of the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings. In the first place, that processing would involve storing the data in a variety of ways, namely not only in a public register but also in the databases of the credit information agencies, it being specified that those agencies store the data not in relation to a specific reason but rather in the event that their contractual partners ask them for such information. In the second place, those agencies store the data for three years, on the basis of a code of conduct within the meaning of Article\u00a040 of the GDPR, whereas the national legislation provides for a storage period of only six months in the case of the public register.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the first of those aspects, SCHUFA argues that it would be impossible to provide information in a timely manner if a credit information agency had to wait for a specific request before it could start collecting data.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is for the referring court to ascertain whether the storage of the data at issue by SCHUFA in its own databases is limited to what is strictly necessary in order to achieve the legitimate interest pursued, when the data at issue can be consulted in the public register and without a commercial undertaking having requested information in a specific case. If this were not the case, the storage of such data by SCHUFA could not be considered necessary for the period during which the data are made available to the public.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the length of time for which the data are stored, it must be held that the examinations of the second and third conditions referred to in paragraph\u00a075 of this judgment merge in so far as the assessment of whether, in the present case, the legitimate interests pursued by the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings cannot reasonably be achieved by a shorter period for storing the data requires a balancing of the opposing rights and interests at issue.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the balancing of the legitimate interests pursued, it should be noted that, in so far as the analysis provided by a credit information agency makes it possible to assess objectively and reliably the creditworthiness of the potential customers of the contractual partners of the agency supplying that credit information, it makes it possible to compensate for disparities in information and therefore to reduce the risks of fraud and other uncertainties.\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, as regards the rights and interests of the data subject, the processing of data relating to the granting of a discharge from remaining debts, by a credit information agency, such as the storage, analysis and communication of such data to a third party, constitutes a serious interference with the fundamental rights of the data subject, enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter. Such data is used as a negative factor when assessing the data subject\u2019s creditworthiness and therefore constitutes sensitive information about his or her private life (see, to that effect, judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a098). The processing of such data is likely to be considerably detrimental to the interests of the data subject in so far as such disclosure is likely to make it significantly more difficult for him or her to exercise his or her freedoms, particularly where basic needs are concerned.\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as the Commission has pointed out, the longer the data in question is stored by credit information agencies, the greater the impact on the interests and private life of the data subject and the greater the requirements relating to the lawfulness of the storage of that information.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that, as stated in recital\u00a076 of Regulation 2015/848, the purpose of a public insolvency register is to improve the provision of information to creditors as well as to the courts concerned. In that context, Article\u00a079(5) of that regulation merely provides that Member States are to inform data subjects of the accessibility period set for personal data stored in insolvency registers, without setting a time limit for the retention of such data. By contrast, it is apparent from Article\u00a079(4) of the GDPR that Member States are responsible, in accordance with that regulation, for the collection and storage of personal data in national databases. The retention period for such data must then be set in compliance with the GDPR.\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, the German legislature provides that information relating to the granting of a discharge from remaining debts is kept in the insolvency register for only six months. It therefore considers that, after the expiry of a six-month period, the rights and interests of the data subject take precedence over those of the public to have access to that information.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a075 of his Opinion, the discharge from remaining debts is intended to allow the person who benefits from it to re-enter economic life and is therefore generally of existential importance to that person. The attainment of that objective would be jeopardised if credit information agencies could, for the purposes of assessing the economic situation of a person, retain data relating to a discharge from remaining debts and use such data after they have been deleted from the public insolvency register, in so far as those data are still used as a negative factor when assessing the solvency of such a person.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the interests of the credit sector in having access to information on a discharge from remaining debts cannot justify the processing of personal data such as that at issue in the main proceedings beyond the period for which the data are kept in the public insolvency register, so that the retention of those data by a credit information agency cannot be based on point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR as regards the period following the deletion of those data from a public insolvency register.\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the six-month period during which the data in question are also available in that public register, it should be noted that, although the effects of parallel storage of those data in the databases of such agencies may be regarded as less serious than after the six months have elapsed, such storage nevertheless constitutes an interference with the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter. In that regard, the Court has already held that the presence of the same personal data in several sources reinforces the interference with the individual\u2019s right to privacy (see judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraphs\u00a086 and 87). It is for the referring court to weigh up the interests involved and the impact on the data subject concerned, in order to establish whether the parallel storage of those data by private credit information agencies can be regarded as being limited to what is strictly necessary, as required by the case-law of the Court cited in paragraph\u00a088 of this judgment.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, with regard to the existence, as in the present case, of a code of conduct providing that a credit information agency must delete data relating to a release from remaining debts after a period of three years, it should be recalled that, in accordance with Article\u00a040(1) and (2) of the GDPR, codes of conduct are intended to contribute to the proper application of that regulation, taking account of the specific features of the various processing sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Thus, associations and other bodies representing categories of data controllers or processors may draw up, amend or extend codes of conduct, for the purpose of specifying the application of that regulation, such as with regard to fair and transparent processing, the legitimate interests pursued by controllers in specific contexts and the collection of personal data.\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, under Article\u00a040(5) of the GDPR, a draft code is to be submitted to the competent supervisory authority, which is to approve it if it finds that it provides sufficient appropriate safeguards.\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the code of conduct at issue in the main proceedings was drawn up by the association of German credit information agencies and approved by the competent supervisory authority.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, while, in accordance with Article\u00a040(1) and (2) of the GDPR, a code of conduct is intended to contribute to the proper application of that regulation and to specify the application of that regulation, the fact remains, as the Advocate General observed in points\u00a0103 and 104 of his Opinion, that the conditions for the lawfulness of the processing of personal data laid down by such a code cannot differ from the conditions laid down in Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR.\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, a code of conduct that leads to an assessment different from that obtained pursuant to point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR cannot be taken into account in the balance of interests under that provision.\n\u00a0\nArticle\u00a017 of the GDPR\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, the referring court raises the question, in essence, of the obligations incumbent on a credit information agency under Article\u00a017 of the GDPR.\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that, under Article\u00a017(1)(d) of the GDPR, to which the referring court refers, the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller has the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where the personal data have been unlawfully processed.\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, according to the clear wording of that provision, if the national court were to conclude from its assessment of the lawfulness of the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings that that processing was not lawful, it would be incumbent on the controller, in this case SCHUFA, to delete the data concerned as soon as possible. This would be the case, as noted in paragraph\u00a099 of this judgment, in respect of the processing of personal data beyond the six-month period for which the data are kept in the public insolvency register.\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the processing at issue during the six-month period in which the data are available in the public insolvency register, if the referring court were to conclude that the processing complied with point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, Article\u00a017(1)(c) of that regulation would apply.\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That provision establishes the right to erasure of personal data where the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article\u00a021(1) of the GDPR and there are no \u2018overriding legitimate grounds for the processing\u2019. Under the latter provision, the data subject is to have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point\u00a0(e) or (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR. The controller is no longer required to process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a093 of his Opinion, it follows from a combined reading of those provisions that the data subject enjoys a right to object to processing and a right to erasure, unless there are overriding legitimate grounds which take precedence over the interests and rights and freedoms of that person within the meaning of Article\u00a021(1) of the GDPR, which it is for the controller to demonstrate.\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, if the controller fails to provide such proof, the data subject is entitled to request the erasure of the data on the basis of Article\u00a017(1)(c) of the GDPR, where he or she objects to the processing in accordance with Article\u00a021(1) of that regulation. It is for the referring court to examine whether, exceptionally, there are overriding legitimate grounds capable of justifying the processing in question.\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the second to fifth questions should be answered as follows:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a05(1)(a) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, must be interpreted as precluding a practice of private credit information agencies consisting in retaining, in their own databases, information from a public register relating to the grant of a discharge from remaining debts in favour of natural persons in order to be able to provide information on the solvency of those persons, for a period extending beyond that during which the data are kept in the public register;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a017(1)(c) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay where he or she objects to the processing pursuant to Article\u00a021(1) of that regulation and there are no overriding legitimate grounds capable of justifying, exceptionally, the processing in question;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a017(1)(d) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the controller is required to erase unlawfully processed personal data as soon as possible.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a078(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\nmust be interpreted as meaning that a decision on a complaint adopted by a supervisory authority is subject to full judicial review.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a05(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, read in conjunction with point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation,\nmust be interpreted as precluding a practice of private credit information agencies consisting in retaining, in their own databases, information from a public register relating to the grant of a discharge from remaining debts in favour of natural persons in order to be able to provide information on the solvency of those persons, for a period extending beyond that during which the data are kept in the public register.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a017(1)(c) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay where he or she objects to the processing pursuant to Article\u00a021(1) of that regulation and there are no overriding legitimate grounds capable of justifying, exceptionally, the processing in question.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a017(1)(d) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the controller is required to erase unlawfully processed personal data as soon as possible."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 6 Oct 2015, C-362/14 (\nSchrems I\n)\nGeneral data protection law \n >

and 28 of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free

56, 57, 60, 62 and 63 in the preamble to Directive 95/46 are worded as follows:\n\u2018(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... data-processing systems are designed to serve man; \u2026 they must,

The Principles were developed in consultation with industry and the general public to facilitate trade and commerce between the United States and European Union. They are intended for use solely by US organisations receiving personal data from the European Union for the purpose of qualifying for the safe harbour and the presumption of \u201cadequacy\u201d it creates. Because the Principles were solely designed to serve this specific purpose, their adoption for other purposes may be inappropriate. \u2026\nDecisions by organisations to qualify for the safe harbour are entirely voluntary, and organisations may qualify for the safe harbour in different ways. ...\nAdherence to these Principles may be limited: (a) to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements; (b) by statute, government regulation, or case-law that create conflicting obligations or explicit authorisations, provided that, in exercising any such authorisation, an organisation can demonstrate that its non-compliance with the Principles is limited to the extent necessary to meet the overriding legitimate interests furthered by such authorisation; or (c) if the effect of the Directive [or] Member State law is to allow exceptions or derogations, provided such exceptions or derogations are applied in comparable contexts. Consistent with the goal of enhancing privacy protection, organisations should strive to implement these Principles fully and transparently, including indicating in their privacy policies where exceptions to the Principles permitted by (b) above will apply on a regular basis. For the same reason, where the option is allowable under the Principles and/or US law, organisations are expected to opt for the higher protection where possible.\n...\u2019\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annex\u00a0II to Decision 2000/520 reads as follows:\n\u2018Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n...\nFAQ 6\u00a0\u2014 Self-Certification\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHow does an organisation self-certify that it adheres to the Safe Harbour Principles? \nA:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Safe harbour benefits are assured from the date on which an organisation self-certifies to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) its adherence to the Principles in accordance with the guidance set forth below.\nTo self-certify for the safe harbour, organisations can provide to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) a letter, signed by a corporate officer on behalf of the organisation that is joining the safe harbour, that contains at least the following information:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0name of organisation, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0description of the activities of the organisation with respect to personal information received from the [European Union]; and\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0description of the organisation\u2019s privacy policy for such personal information, including: (a) where the privacy policy is available for viewing by the public, (b) its effective date of implementation, (c) a contact office for the handling of complaints, access requests, and any other issues arising under the safe harbour, (d) the specific statutory body that has jurisdiction to hear any claims against the organisation regarding possible unfair or deceptive practices and violations of laws or regulations governing privacy (and that is listed in the annex to the Principles), (e) name of any privacy programmes in which the organisation is a member, (f) method of verification (e.g. in-house, third party) \u2026, and (g) the independent recourse mechanism that is available to investigate unresolved complaints.\nWhere the organisation wishes its safe harbour benefits to cover human resources information transferred from the [European Union] for use in the context of the employment relationship, it may do so where there is a statutory body with jurisdiction to hear claims against the organisation arising out of human resources information that is listed in the annex to the Principles. ...\nThe Department (or its designee) will maintain a list of all organisations that file such letters, thereby assuring the availability of safe harbour benefits, and will update such list on the basis of annual letters and notifications received pursuant to FAQ 11. ...\n...\nFAQ 11\u00a0\u2014 Dispute Resolution and Enforcement\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHow should the dispute resolution requirements of the Enforcement Principle be implemented, and how will an organisation\u2019s persistent failure to comply with the Principles be handled? \nA:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Enforcement Principle sets out the requirements for safe harbour enforcement. How to meet the requirements of point (b) of the Principle is set out in the FAQ on verification (FAQ 7). This FAQ 11 addresses points (a) and (c), both of which require independent recourse mechanisms. These mechanisms may take different forms, but they must meet the Enforcement Principle\u2019s requirements. Organisations may satisfy the requirements through the following: (1) compliance with private sector developed privacy programmes that incorporate the Safe Harbour Principles into their rules and that include effective enforcement mechanisms of the type described in the Enforcement Principle; (2) compliance with legal or regulatory supervisory authorities that provide for handling of individual complaints and dispute resolution; or (3) commitment to cooperate with data protection authorities located in the European Union or their authorised representatives. This list is intended to be illustrative and not limiting. The private sector may design other mechanisms to provide enforcement, so long as they meet the requirements of the Enforcement Principle and the FAQs. Please note that the Enforcement Principle\u2019s requirements are additional to the requirements set forth in paragraph\u00a03 of the introduction to the Principles that self-regulatory efforts must be enforceable under Article\u00a05 of the Federal Trade Commission Act or similar statute.\nRecourse Mechanisms\nConsumers should be encouraged to raise any complaints they may have with the relevant organisation before proceeding to independent recourse mechanisms. ...\n...\nFTC Action\nThe FTC has committed to reviewing on a priority basis referrals received from privacy self-regulatory organisations, such as BBBOnline and TRUSTe, and EU Member States alleging non-compliance with the Safe Harbour Principles to determine whether Section\u00a05 of the FTC Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce has been violated. ...\n\u2026\u2019\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annex\u00a0IV to Decision 2000/520 states:\n\u2018Damages for Breaches of Privacy, Legal Authorisations and Mergers and Takeovers in US Law\nThis responds to the request by the European Commission for clarification of US law with respect to (a) claims for damages for breaches of privacy, (b) \u201cexplicit authorisations\u201d in US law for the use of personal information in a manner inconsistent with the safe harbour principles, and (c) the effect of mergers and takeovers on obligations undertaken pursuant to the safe harbour principles.\n...\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Explicit Legal Authorisations \nThe safe harbour principles contain an exception where statute, regulation or case-law create \u201cconflicting obligations or explicit authorisations, provided that, in exercising any such authorisation, an organisation can demonstrate that its non-compliance with the principles is limited to the extent necessary to meet the overriding legitimate interests further[ed] by such authorisation\u201d. Clearly, where US law imposes a conflicting obligation, US organisations whether in the safe harbour or not must comply with the law. As for explicit authorisations, while the safe harbour principles are intended to bridge the differences between the US and European regimes for privacy protection, we owe deference to the legislative prerogatives of our elected lawmakers. The limited exception from strict adherence to the safe harbour principles seeks to strike a balance to accommodate the legitimate interests on each side.\nThe exception is limited to cases where there is an explicit authorisation. Therefore, as a threshold matter, the relevant statute, regulation or court decision must affirmatively authorise the particular conduct by safe harbour organisations ... In other words, the exception would not apply where the law is silent. In addition, the exception would apply only if the explicit authorisation conflicts with adherence to the safe harbour principles. Even then, the exception \u201cis limited to the extent necessary to meet the overriding legitimate interests furthered by such authorisation\u201d. By way of illustration, where the law simply authorises a company to provide personal information to government authorities, the exception would not apply. Conversely, where the law specifically authorises the company to provide personal information to government agencies without the individual\u2019s consent, this would constitute an \u201cexplicit authorisation\u201d to act in a manner that conflicts with the safe harbour principles. Alternatively, specific exceptions from affirmative requirements to provide notice and consent would fall within the exception (since it would be the equivalent of a specific authorisation to disclose the information without notice and consent). For example, a statute which authorises doctors to provide their patients\u2019 medical records to health officials without the patients\u2019 prior consent might permit an exception from the notice and choice principles. This authorisation would not permit a doctor to provide the same medical records to health maintenance organisations or commercial pharmaceutical research laboratories, which would be beyond the scope of the purposes authorised by the law and therefore beyond the scope of the exception ... The legal authority in question can be a \u201cstand alone\u201d authorisation to do specific things with personal information, but, as the examples below illustrate, it is likely to be an exception to a broader law which proscribes the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information.\n...\u2019\n\u00a0\nCommunication COM(2013)\u00a0846 final\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 27\u00a0November 2013 the Commission adopted the communication to the European Parliament and the Council entitled \u2018Rebuilding Trust in EU-US Data Flows\u2019 (COM(2013)\u00a0846 final) (\u2018Communication COM(2013)\u00a0846 final\u2019). The communication was accompanied by the \u2018Report on the Findings by the EU Co-chairs of the ad hoc EU-US Working Group on Data Protection\u2019, also dated 27\u00a0November 2013. That report was drawn up, as stated in point\u00a01 thereof, in cooperation with the United States after the existence in that country of a number of surveillance programmes involving the large-scale collection and processing of personal data had been revealed. The report contained inter alia a detailed analysis of United States law as regards, in particular, the legal bases authorising the existence of surveillance programmes and the collection and processing of personal data by United States authorities. \n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In point\u00a01 of Communication COM(2013)\u00a0846 final, the Commission stated that \u2018[c]ommercial exchanges are addressed by Decision [2000/520]\u2019, adding that \u2018[t]his Decision provides a legal basis for transfers of personal data from the [European Union] to companies established in the [United States] which have adhered to the Safe Harbour Privacy Principles\u2019. In addition, the Commission underlined in point\u00a01 the increasing relevance of personal data flows, owing in particular to the development of the digital economy which has indeed \u2018led to exponential growth in the quantity, quality, diversity and nature of data processing activities\u2019.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In point\u00a02 of that communication, the Commission observed that \u2018concerns about the level of protection of personal data of [Union] citizens transferred to the [United States] under the Safe Harbour scheme have grown\u2019 and that \u2018[t]he voluntary and declaratory nature of the scheme has sharpened focus on its transparency and enforcement\u2019.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It further stated in point\u00a02 that \u2018[t]he personal data of [Union] citizens sent to the [United States] under the Safe Harbour may be accessed and further processed by US authorities in a way incompatible with the grounds on which the data was originally collected in the [European Union] and the purposes for which it was transferred to the [United States]\u2019 and that \u2018[a] majority of the US internet companies that appear to be more directly concerned by [the surveillance] programmes are certified under the Safe Harbour scheme\u2019.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In point\u00a03.2 of Communication COM(2013)\u00a0846 final, the Commission noted a number of weaknesses in the application of Decision 2000/520. It stated, first, that some certified United States companies did not comply with the principles referred to in Article\u00a01(1) of Decision 2000/520 (\u2018the safe harbour principles\u2019) and that improvements had to be made to that decision regarding \u2018structural shortcomings related to transparency and enforcement, the substantive Safe Harbour principles and the operation of the national security exception\u2019. It observed, secondly, that \u2018Safe Harbour also acts as a conduit for the transfer of the personal data of EU citizens from the [European Union] to the [United States] by companies required to surrender data to US intelligence agencies under the US intelligence collection programmes\u2019.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission concluded in point\u00a03.2 that whilst, \u2018[g]iven the weaknesses identified, the current implementation of Safe Harbour cannot be maintained, ... its revocation would[, however,] adversely affect the interests of member companies in the [European Union] and in the [United States]\u2019. Finally, the Commission added in that point that it would \u2018engage with the US authorities to discuss the shortcomings identified\u2019.\n\u00a0\nCommunication COM(2013)\u00a0847 final\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the same date, 27\u00a0November 2013, the Commission adopted the communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the Functioning of the Safe Harbour from the Perspective of EU Citizens and Companies Established in the [European Union] (COM(2013)\u00a0847 final) (\u2018Communication COM(2013)\u00a0847 final\u2019). As is clear from point\u00a01 thereof, that communication was based inter alia on information received in the ad hoc EU-US Working Group and followed two Commission assessment reports published in 2002 and 2004 respectively.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Point\u00a01 of Communication COM(2013)\u00a0847 final explains that the functioning of Decision 2000/520 \u2018relies on commitments and self-certification of adhering companies\u2019, adding that \u2018[s]igning up to these arrangements is voluntary, but the rules are binding for those who sign up\u2019.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it is apparent from point\u00a02.2 of Communication COM(2013)\u00a0847 final that, as at 26\u00a0September 2013, 3\u00a0246 companies, falling within many industry and services sectors, were certified. Those companies mainly provided services in the EU internal market, in particular in the internet sector, and some of them were EU companies which had subsidiaries in the United States. Some of those companies processed the data of their employees in Europe which was transferred to the United States for human resource purposes.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission stated in point\u00a02.2 that \u2018[a]ny gap in transparency or in enforcement on the US side results in responsibility being shifted to European data protection authorities and to the companies which use the scheme\u2019.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent, in particular, from points\u00a03 to 5 and 8 of Communication COM(2013)\u00a0847 final that, in practice, a significant number of certified companies did not comply, or did not comply fully, with the safe harbour principles.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Commission stated in point\u00a07 of Communication COM(2013)\u00a0847 final that \u2018all companies involved in the PRISM programme [a large-scale intelligence collection programme], and which grant access to US authorities to data stored and processed in the [United States], appear to be Safe Harbour certified\u2019 and that \u2018[t]his has made the Safe Harbour scheme one of the conduits through which access is given to US intelligence authorities to collecting personal data initially processed in the [European Union]\u2019. In that regard, the Commission noted in point\u00a07.1 of that communication that \u2018a number of legal bases under US law allow large-scale collection and processing of personal data that is stored or otherwise processed [by] companies based in the [United States]\u2019 and that \u2018[t]he large-scale nature of these programmes may result in data transferred under Safe Harbour being accessed and further processed by US authorities beyond what is strictly necessary and proportionate to the protection of national security as foreseen under the exception provided in [Decision 2000/520]\u2019.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In point\u00a07.2 of Communication COM(2013)\u00a0847 final, headed \u2018Limitations and redress possibilities\u2019, the Commission noted that \u2018safeguards that are provided under US law are mostly available to US citizens or legal residents\u2019 and that, \u2018[m]oreover, there are no opportunities for either EU or US data subjects to obtain access, rectification or erasure of data, or administrative or judicial redress with regard to collection and further processing of their personal data taking place under the US surveillance programmes\u2019.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to point\u00a08 of Communication COM(2013)\u00a0847 final, the certified companies included \u2018[w]eb companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo\u2019, which had \u2018hundreds of millions of clients in Europe\u2019 and transferred personal data to the United States for processing.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission concluded in point\u00a08 that \u2018the large-scale access by intelligence agencies to data transferred to the [United States] by Safe Harbour certified companies raises additional serious questions regarding the continuity of data protection rights of Europeans when their data is transferred to the [United States]\u2019.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Schrems, an Austrian national residing in Austria, has been a user of the Facebook social network (\u2018Facebook\u2019) since 2008.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any person residing in the European Union who wishes to use Facebook is required to conclude, at the time of his registration, a contract with Facebook Ireland, a subsidiary of Facebook Inc. which is itself established in the United States. Some or all of the personal data of Facebook Ireland\u2019s users who reside in the European Union is transferred to servers belonging to Facebook Inc. that are located in the United States, where it undergoes processing. \n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 25\u00a0June 2013 Mr\u00a0Schrems made a complaint to the Commissioner by which he in essence asked the latter to exercise his statutory powers by prohibiting Facebook Ireland from transferring his personal data to the United States. He contended in his complaint that the law and practice in force in that country did not ensure adequate protection of the personal data held in its territory against the surveillance activities that were engaged in there by the public authorities. Mr\u00a0Schrems referred in this regard to the revelations made by Edward Snowden concerning the activities of the United States intelligence services, in particular those of the National Security Agency (\u2018the NSA\u2019).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the Commissioner took the view that he was not required to investigate the matters raised by Mr\u00a0Schrems in the complaint, he rejected it as unfounded. The Commissioner considered that there was no evidence that Mr\u00a0Schrems\u2019 personal data had been accessed by the NSA. He added that the allegations raised by Mr\u00a0Schrems in his complaint could not be profitably put forward since any question of the adequacy of data protection in the United States had to be determined in accordance with Decision 2000/520 and the Commission had found in that decision that the United States ensured an adequate level of protection.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Schrems brought an action before the High Court challenging the decision at issue in the main proceedings. After considering the evidence adduced by the parties to the main proceedings, the High Court found that the electronic surveillance and interception of personal data transferred from the European Union to the United States serve necessary and indispensable objectives in the public interest. However, it added that the revelations made by Edward Snowden had demonstrated a \u2018significant over-reach\u2019 on the part of the NSA and other federal agencies.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the High Court, Union citizens have no effective right to be heard. Oversight of the intelligence services\u2019 actions is carried out within the framework of an \nex parte\n and secret procedure. Once the personal data has been transferred to the United States, it is capable of being accessed by the NSA and other federal agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in the course of the indiscriminate surveillance and interception carried out by them on a large scale.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The High Court stated that Irish law precludes the transfer of personal data outside national territory save where the third country ensures an adequate level of protection for privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms. The importance of the rights to privacy and to inviolability of the dwelling, which are guaranteed by the Irish Constitution, requires that any interference with those rights be proportionate and in accordance with the law.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The High Court held that the mass and undifferentiated accessing of personal data is clearly contrary to the principle of proportionality and the fundamental values protected by the Irish Constitution. In order for interception of electronic communications to be regarded as consistent with the Irish Constitution, it would be necessary to demonstrate that the interception is targeted, that the surveillance of certain persons or groups of persons is objectively justified in the interests of national security or the suppression of crime and that there are appropriate and verifiable safeguards. Thus, according to the High Court, if the main proceedings were to be disposed of on the basis of Irish law alone, it would then have to be found that, given the existence of a serious doubt as to whether the United States ensures an adequate level of protection of personal data, the Commissioner should have proceeded to investigate the matters raised by Mr\u00a0Schrems in his complaint and that the Commissioner was wrong in rejecting the complaint. \n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the High Court considers that this case concerns the implementation of EU law as referred to in Article\u00a051 of the Charter and that the legality of the decision at issue in the main proceedings must therefore be assessed in the light of EU law. According to the High Court, Decision 2000/520 does not satisfy the requirements flowing both from Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter and from the principles set out by the Court of Justice in the judgment in \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others \n(C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238). The right to respect for private life, guaranteed by Article\u00a07 of the Charter and by the core values common to the traditions of the Member States, would be rendered meaningless if the State authorities were authorised to access electronic communications on a casual and generalised basis without any objective justification based on considerations of national security or the prevention of crime that are specific to the individual concerned and without those practices being accompanied by appropriate and verifiable safeguards.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The High Court further observes that in his action Mr\u00a0Schrems in reality raises the legality of the safe harbour regime which was established by Decision 2000/520 and gives rise to the decision at issue in the main proceedings. Thus, even though Mr\u00a0Schrems has not formally contested the validity of either Directive 95/46 or Decision 2000/520, the question is raised, according to the High Court, as to whether, on account of Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, the Commissioner was bound by the Commission\u2019s finding in Decision 2000/520 that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection or whether Article\u00a08 of the Charter authorised the Commissioner to break free, if appropriate, from such a finding.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the High Court decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether in the course of determining a complaint which has been made to an independent office holder who has been vested by statute with the functions of administering and enforcing data protection legislation that personal data is being transferred to another third country (in this case, the United States of America) the laws and practices of which, it is claimed, do not contain adequate protections for the data subject, that office holder is absolutely bound by the Community finding to the contrary contained in [Decision 2000/520] having regard to Article\u00a07, Article\u00a08 and Article\u00a047 of [the Charter], the provisions of Article\u00a025(6) of Directive [95/46] notwithstanding?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or, alternatively, may and/or must the office holder conduct his or her own investigation of the matter in the light of factual developments in the meantime since that Commission decision was first published?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether and to what extent Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that a decision adopted pursuant to that provision, such as Decision 2000/520, by which the Commission finds that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection, prevents a supervisory authority of a Member State, within the meaning of Article\u00a028 of that directive, from being able to examine the claim of a person concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal data relating to him which has been transferred from a Member State to that third country when that person contends that the law and practices in force in the third country do not ensure an adequate level of protection.\n\u00a0\nThe powers of the national supervisory authorities, within the meaning of Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, when the Commission has adopted a decision pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of that directive \n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be recalled first of all that the provisions of Directive 95/46, inasmuch as they govern the processing of personal data liable to infringe fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to respect for private life, must necessarily be interpreted in the light of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter (see judgments in \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01, EU:C:2003:294, paragraph\u00a068; \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a068; and \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraph\u00a029).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from Article\u00a01 of Directive 95/46 and recitals\u00a02 and 10 in its preamble that that directive seeks to ensure not only effective and complete protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the fundamental right to respect for private life with regard to the processing of personal data, but also a high level of protection of those fundamental rights and freedoms. The importance of both the fundamental right to respect for private life, guaranteed by Article\u00a07 of the Charter, and the fundamental right to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Article\u00a08 thereof, is, moreover, emphasised in the case-law of the Court (see judgments in \nRijkeboer\n, C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293, paragraph\u00a047; \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a053; and \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraphs, 53, 66, 74 and the case-law cited).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the powers available to the national supervisory authorities in respect of transfers of personal data to third countries, it should be noted that Article\u00a028(1) of Directive 95/46 requires Member States to set up one or more public authorities responsible for monitoring, with complete independence, compliance with EU rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of such data. In addition, that requirement derives from the primary law of the European Union, in particular Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter and Article\u00a016(2) TFEU (see, to this effect, judgments in \nCommission\n v \nAustria\n, C-614/10, EU:C:2012:631, paragraph\u00a036, and \nCommission\n v \nHungary\n, C-288/12, EU:C:2014:237, paragraph\u00a047).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The guarantee of the independence of national supervisory authorities is intended to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of the monitoring of compliance with the provisions concerning protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and must be interpreted in the light of that aim. It was established in order to strengthen the protection of individuals and bodies affected by the decisions of those authorities. The establishment in Member States of independent supervisory authorities is therefore, as stated in recital\u00a062 in the preamble to Directive 95/46, an essential component of the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data (see judgments in \nCommission\n v \nGermany\n, C-518/07, EU:C:2010:125, paragraph\u00a025, and \nCommission\n v \nHungary\n, C-288/12, EU:C:2014:237, paragraph\u00a048 and the case-law cited).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to guarantee that protection, the national supervisory authorities must, in particular, ensure a fair balance between, on the one hand, observance of the fundamental right to privacy and, on the other hand, the interests requiring free movement of personal data (see, to this effect, judgments in \nCommission \nv \nGermany\n, C-518/07, EU:C:2010:125, paragraph\u00a024, and \nCommission\n v \nHungary\n, C-288/12, EU:C:2014:237, paragraph\u00a051).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national supervisory authorities have a wide range of powers for that purpose. Those powers, listed on a non-exhaustive basis in Article\u00a028(3) of Directive 95/46, constitute necessary means to perform their duties, as stated in recital\u00a063 in the preamble to the directive. Thus, those authorities possess, in particular, investigative powers, such as the power to collect all the information necessary for the performance of their supervisory duties, effective powers of intervention, such as that of imposing a temporary or definitive ban on processing of data, and the power to engage in legal proceedings.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is, admittedly, apparent from Article\u00a028(1) and (6) of Directive 95/46 that the powers of the national supervisory authorities concern processing of personal data carried out on the territory of their own Member State, so that they do not have powers on the basis of Article\u00a028 in respect of processing of such data carried out in a third country.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the operation consisting in having personal data transferred from a Member State to a third country constitutes, in itself, processing of personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 (see, to this effect, judgment in \nParliament \nv \nCouncil and Commission\n, C-317/04 and C-318/04, EU:C:2006:346, paragraph\u00a056) carried out in a Member State. That provision defines \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 as \u2018any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means\u2019 and mentions, by way of example, \u2018disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available\u2019.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recital 60 in the preamble to Directive 95/46 states that transfers of personal data to third countries may be effected only in full compliance with the provisions adopted by the Member States pursuant to the directive. In that regard, Chapter\u00a0IV of the directive, in which Articles\u00a025 and 26 appear, has set up a regime intended to ensure that the Member States oversee transfers of personal data to third countries. That regime is complementary to the general regime set up by Chapter\u00a0II of the directive laying down the general rules on the lawfulness of the processing of personal data (see, to this effect, judgment in \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a063).\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As, in accordance with Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter and Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, the national supervisory authorities are responsible for monitoring compliance with the EU rules concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, each of them is therefore vested with the power to check whether a transfer of personal data from its own Member State to a third country complies with the requirements laid down by Directive 95/46.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whilst acknowledging, in recital\u00a056 in its preamble, that transfers of personal data from the Member States to third countries are necessary for the expansion of international trade, Directive 95/46 lays down as a principle, in Article\u00a025(1), that such transfers may take place only if the third country ensures an adequate level of protection.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, recital\u00a057 states that transfers of personal data to third countries not ensuring an adequate level of protection must be prohibited.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to control transfers of personal data to third countries according to the level of protection accorded to it in each of those countries, Article\u00a025 of Directive 95/46 imposes a series of obligations on the Member States and the Commission. It is apparent, in particular, from that article that the finding that a third country does or does not ensure an adequate level of protection may, as the Advocate General has observed in point\u00a086 of his Opinion, be made either by the Member States or by the Commission.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission may adopt, on the basis of Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, a decision finding that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In accordance with the second subparagraph of that provision, such a decision is addressed to the Member States, who must take the measures necessary to comply with it. Pursuant to the fourth paragraph of Article\u00a0288 TFEU, it is binding on all the Member States to which it is addressed and is therefore binding on all their organs (see, to this effect, judgments in \nAlbako Margarinefabrik\n, 249/85, EU:C:1987:245, paragraph\u00a017, and \nMediaset\n, C-69/13, EU:C:2014:71, paragraph\u00a023) in so far as it has the effect of authorising transfers of personal data from the Member States to the third country covered by it. \n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, until such time as the Commission decision is declared invalid by the Court, the Member States and their organs, which include their independent supervisory authorities, admittedly cannot adopt measures contrary to that decision, such as acts intended to determine with binding effect that the third country covered by it does not ensure an adequate level of protection. Measures of the EU institutions are in principle presumed to be lawful and accordingly produce legal effects until such time as they are withdrawn, annulled in an action for annulment or declared invalid following a reference for a preliminary ruling or a plea of illegality (judgment in \nCommission\n v \nGreece\n, C-475/01, EU:C:2004:585, paragraph\u00a018 and the case-law cited).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, a Commission decision adopted pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, such as Decision 2000/520, cannot prevent persons whose personal data has been or could be transferred to a third country from lodging with the national supervisory authorities a claim, within the meaning of Article\u00a028(4) of that directive, concerning the protection of their rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of that data. Likewise, as the Advocate General has observed in particular in points\u00a061, 93 and 116 of his Opinion, a decision of that nature cannot eliminate or reduce the powers expressly accorded to the national supervisory authorities by Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter and Article\u00a028 of the directive.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter nor Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46 excludes from the national supervisory authorities\u2019 sphere of competence the oversight of transfers of personal data to third countries which have been the subject of a Commission decision pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the first subparagraph of Article\u00a028(4) of Directive 95/46, under which the national supervisory authorities are to hear \u2018claims lodged by any person \u2026 concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal data\u2019, does not provide for any exception in this regard where the Commission has adopted a decision pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of that directive. \n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it would be contrary to the system set up by Directive 95/46 and to the objective of Articles\u00a025 and 28 thereof for a Commission decision adopted pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) to have the effect of preventing a national supervisory authority from examining a person\u2019s claim concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of his personal data which has been or could be transferred from a Member State to the third country covered by that decision. \n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the contrary, Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46 applies, by its very nature, to any processing of personal data. Thus, even if the Commission has adopted a decision pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of that directive, the national supervisory authorities, when hearing a claim lodged by a person concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal data relating to him, must be able to examine, with complete independence, whether the transfer of that data complies with the requirements laid down by the directive. \n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If that were not so, persons whose personal data has been or could be transferred to the third country concerned would be denied the right, guaranteed by Article\u00a08(1) and (3) of the Charter, to lodge with the national supervisory authorities a claim for the purpose of protecting their fundamental rights (see, by analogy, judgment in \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a068).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A claim, within the meaning of Article\u00a028(4) of Directive 95/46, by which a person whose personal data has been or could be transferred to a third country contends, as in the main proceedings, that, notwithstanding what the Commission has found in a decision adopted pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of that directive, the law and practices of that country do not ensure an adequate level of protection must be understood as concerning, in essence, whether that decision is compatible with the protection of the privacy and of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this connection, the Court\u2019s settled case-law should be recalled according to which the European Union is a union based on the rule of law in which all acts of its institutions are subject to review of their compatibility with, in particular, the Treaties, general principles of law and fundamental rights (see, to this effect, judgments in \nCommission and Others\n v \nKadi\n, C-584/10\u00a0P, C-593/10\u00a0P and C-595/10\u00a0P, EU:C:2013:518, paragraph\u00a066; \nInuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others\n v \nParliament and Council\n, C-583/11\u00a0P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraph\u00a091; and \nTelef\u00f3nica \nv \nCommission\n, C-274/12\u00a0P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph\u00a056). Commission decisions adopted pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46 cannot therefore escape such review.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, the Court alone has jurisdiction to declare that an EU act, such as a Commission decision adopted pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, is invalid, the exclusivity of that jurisdiction having the purpose of guaranteeing legal certainty by ensuring that EU law is applied uniformly (see judgments in \nMelki and Abdeli\n, C-188/10 and C-189/10, EU:C:2010:363, paragraph\u00a054, and \nCIVAD\n, C-533/10, EU:C:2012:347, paragraph\u00a040). \n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whilst the national courts are admittedly entitled to consider the validity of an EU act, such as a Commission decision adopted pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, they are not, however, endowed with the power to declare such an act invalid themselves (see, to this effect, judgments in \nFoto-Frost\n, 314/85, EU:C:1987:452, paragraphs\u00a015 to 20, and \nIATA and ELFAA\n, C-344/04, EU:C:2006:10, paragraph\u00a027). A fortiori, when the national supervisory authorities examine a claim, within the meaning of Article\u00a028(4) of that directive, concerning the compatibility of a Commission decision adopted pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of the directive with the protection of the privacy and of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, they are not entitled to declare that decision invalid themselves.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to those considerations, where a person whose personal data has been or could be transferred to a third country which has been the subject of a Commission decision pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46 lodges with a national supervisory authority a claim concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of that data and contests, in bringing the claim, as in the main proceedings, the compatibility of that decision with the protection of the privacy and of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, it is incumbent upon the national supervisory authority to examine the claim with all due diligence.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a situation where the national supervisory authority comes to the conclusion that the arguments put forward in support of such a claim are unfounded and therefore rejects it, the person who lodged the claim must, as is apparent from the second subparagraph of Article\u00a028(3) of Directive 95/46, read in the light of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, have access to judicial remedies enabling him to challenge such a decision adversely affecting him before the national courts. Having regard to the case-law cited in paragraphs\u00a061 and 62 of the present judgment, those courts must stay proceedings and make a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling on validity where they consider that one or more grounds for invalidity put forward by the parties or, as the case may be, raised by them of their own motion are well founded (see, to this effect, judgment in \nT & L Sugars and Sidul A\u00e7\u00facares\n v \nCommission\n, C-456/13\u00a0P, EU:C:2015:284, paragraph\u00a048 and the case-law cited).\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the converse situation, where the national supervisory authority considers that the objections advanced by the person who has lodged with it a claim concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of his personal data are well founded, that authority must, in accordance with the third indent of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a028(3) of Directive 95/46, read in the light in particular of Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter, be able to engage in legal proceedings. It is incumbent upon the national legislature to provide for legal remedies enabling the national supervisory authority concerned to put forward the objections which it considers well founded before the national courts in order for them, if they share its doubts as to the validity of the Commission decision, to make a reference for a preliminary ruling for the purpose of examination of the decision\u2019s validity.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the answer to the questions referred is that Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that a decision adopted pursuant to that provision, such as Decision 2000/520, by which the Commission finds that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection, does not prevent a supervisory authority of a Member State, within the meaning of Article\u00a028 of that directive, from examining the claim of a person concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal data relating to him which has been transferred from a Member State to that third country when that person contends that the law and practices in force in the third country do not ensure an adequate level of protection.\n\u00a0\nThe validity of Decision 2000/520\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from the referring court\u2019s explanations relating to the questions submitted, Mr\u00a0Schrems contends in the main proceedings that United States law and practice do not ensure an adequate level of protection within the meaning of Article\u00a025 of Directive 95/46. As the Advocate General has observed in points\u00a0123 and 124 of his Opinion, Mr\u00a0Schrems expresses doubts, which the referring court indeed seems essentially to share, concerning the validity of Decision 2000/520. In such circumstances, having regard to what has been held in paragraphs\u00a060 to 63 of the present judgment and in order to give the referring court a full answer, it should be examined whether that decision complies with the requirements stemming from Directive 95/46 read in the light of the Charter.\n\u00a0The requirements stemming from Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As has already been pointed out in paragraphs\u00a048 and 49 of the present judgment, Article\u00a025(1) of Directive 95/46 prohibits transfers of personal data to a third country not ensuring an adequate level of protection.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, for the purpose of overseeing such transfers, the first subparagraph of Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46 provides that the Commission \u2018may find \u2026 that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of paragraph\u00a02 of this Article, by reason of its domestic law or of the international commitments it has entered into \u2026, for the protection of the private lives and basic freedoms and rights of individuals\u2019.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that neither Article\u00a025(2) of Directive 95/46 nor any other provision of the directive contains a definition of the concept of an adequate level of protection. In particular, Article\u00a025(2) does no more than state that the adequacy of the level of protection afforded by a third country \u2018shall be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or set of data transfer operations\u2019 and lists, on a non-exhaustive basis, the circumstances to which consideration must be given when carrying out such an assessment.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, first, as is apparent from the very wording of Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, that provision requires that a third country \u2018ensures\u2019 an adequate level of protection by reason of its domestic law or its international commitments. Secondly, according to the same provision, the adequacy of the protection ensured by the third country is assessed \u2018for the protection of the private lives and basic freedoms and rights of individuals\u2019. \n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46 implements the express obligation laid down in Article\u00a08(1) of the Charter to protect personal data and, as the Advocate General has observed in point\u00a0139 of his Opinion, is intended to ensure that the high level of that protection continues where personal data is transferred to a third country.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The word \u2018adequate\u2019 in Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46 admittedly signifies that a third country cannot be required to ensure a level of protection identical to that guaranteed in the EU legal order. However, as the Advocate General has observed in point\u00a0141 of his Opinion, the term \u2018adequate level of protection\u2019 must be understood as requiring the third country in fact to ensure, by reason of its domestic law or its international commitments, a level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms that is essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the European Union by virtue of Directive 95/46 read in the light of the Charter. If there were no such requirement, the objective referred to in the previous paragraph of the present judgment would be disregarded. Furthermore, the high level of protection guaranteed by Directive 95/46 read in the light of the Charter could easily be circumvented by transfers of personal data from the European Union to third countries for the purpose of being processed in those countries. \n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from the express wording of Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46 that it is the legal order of the third country covered by the Commission decision that must ensure an adequate level of protection. Even though the means to which that third country has recourse, in this connection, for the purpose of ensuring such a level of protection may differ from those employed within the European Union in order to ensure that the requirements stemming from Directive 95/46 read in the light of the Charter are complied with, those means must nevertheless prove, in practice, effective in order to ensure protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the European Union.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, when examining the level of protection afforded by a third country, the Commission is obliged to assess the content of the applicable rules in that country resulting from its domestic law or international commitments and the practice designed to ensure compliance with those rules, since it must, under Article\u00a025(2) of Directive 95/46, take account of all the circumstances surrounding a transfer of personal data to a third country. \n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also, in the light of the fact that the level of protection ensured by a third country is liable to change, it is incumbent upon the Commission, after it has adopted a decision pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, to check periodically whether the finding relating to the adequacy of the level of protection ensured by the third country in question is still factually and legally justified. Such a check is required, in any event, when evidence gives rise to a doubt in that regard.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, as the Advocate General has stated in points\u00a0134 and 135 of his Opinion, when the validity of a Commission decision adopted pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46 is examined, account must also be taken of the circumstances that have arisen after that decision\u2019s adoption.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, it must be stated that, in view of, first, the important role played by the protection of personal data in the light of the fundamental right to respect for private life and, secondly, the large number of persons whose fundamental rights are liable to be infringed where personal data is transferred to a third country not ensuring an adequate level of protection, the Commission\u2019s discretion as to the adequacy of the level of protection ensured by a third country is reduced, with the result that review of the requirements stemming from Article\u00a025 of Directive 95/46, read in the light of the Charter, should be strict (see, by analogy, judgment in \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraphs\u00a047 and 48).\n\u00a0Article\u00a01 of Decision 2000/520\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission found in Article\u00a01(1) of Decision 2000/520 that the principles set out in Annex\u00a0I thereto, implemented in accordance with the guidance provided by the FAQs set out in Annex\u00a0II, ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organisations established in the United States. It is apparent from that provision that both those principles and the FAQs were issued by the United States Department of Commerce.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An organisation adheres to the safe harbour principles on the basis of a system of self-certification, as is apparent from Article\u00a01(2) and (3) of Decision 2000/520, read in conjunction with FAQ 6 set out in Annex\u00a0II thereto.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whilst recourse by a third country to a system of self-certification is not in itself contrary to the requirement laid down in Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46 that the third country concerned must ensure an adequate level of protection \u2018by reason of its domestic law or \u2026 international commitments\u2019, the reliability of such a system, in the light of that requirement, is founded essentially on the establishment of effective detection and supervision mechanisms enabling any infringements of the rules ensuring the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the right to respect for private life and the right to protection of personal data, to be identified and punished in practice.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, by virtue of the second paragraph of Annex\u00a0I to Decision 2000/520, the safe harbour principles are \u2018intended for use solely by US organisations receiving personal data from the European Union for the purpose of qualifying for the safe harbour and the presumption of \u201cadequacy\u201d it creates\u2019. Those principles are therefore applicable solely to self-certified United States organisations receiving personal data from the European Union, and United States public authorities are not required to comply with them. \n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, Decision 2000/520, pursuant to Article\u00a02 thereof, \u2018concerns only the adequacy of protection provided in the United States under the [safe harbour principles] implemented in accordance with the FAQs with a view to meeting the requirements of Article\u00a025(1) of Directive [95/46]\u2019, without, however, containing sufficient findings regarding the measures by which the United States ensures an adequate level of protection, within the meaning of Article\u00a025(6) of that directive, by reason of its domestic law or its international commitments.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, under the fourth paragraph of Annex\u00a0I to Decision 2000/520, the applicability of the safe harbour principles may be limited, in particular, \u2018to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements\u2019 and \u2018by statute, government regulation, or case-law that create conflicting obligations or explicit authorisations, provided that, in exercising any such authorisation, an organisation can demonstrate that its non-compliance with the Principles is limited to the extent necessary to meet the overriding legitimate interests furthered by such authorisation\u2019.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this connection, Decision 2000/520 states in Part\u00a0B of Annex\u00a0IV, with regard to the limits to which the safe harbour principles\u2019 applicability is subject, that, \u2018[c]learly, where US law imposes a conflicting obligation, US organisations whether in the safe harbour or not must comply with the law\u2019.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, Decision 2000/520 lays down that \u2018national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements\u2019 have primacy over the safe harbour principles, primacy pursuant to which self-certified United States organisations receiving personal data from the European Union are bound to disregard those principles without limitation where they conflict with those requirements and therefore prove incompatible with them.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the general nature of the derogation set out in the fourth paragraph of Annex\u00a0I to Decision 2000/520, that decision thus enables interference, founded on national security and public interest requirements or on domestic legislation of the United States, with the fundamental rights of the persons whose personal data is or could be transferred from the European Union to the United States. To establish the existence of an interference with the fundamental right to respect for private life, it does not matter whether the information in question relating to private life is sensitive or whether the persons concerned have suffered any adverse consequences on account of that interference (judgment in \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a033 and the case-law cited).\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Decision 2000/520 does not contain any finding regarding the existence, in the United States, of rules adopted by the State intended to limit any interference with the fundamental rights of the persons whose data is transferred from the European Union to the United States, interference which the State entities of that country would be authorised to engage in when they pursue legitimate objectives, such as national security.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does Decision 2000/520 refer to the existence of effective legal protection against interference of that kind. As the Advocate General has observed in points\u00a0204 to 206 of his Opinion, procedures before the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 the powers of which, described in particular in FAQ 11 set out in Annex\u00a0II to that decision, are limited to commercial disputes \u2014 and the private dispute resolution mechanisms concern compliance by the United States undertakings with the safe harbour principles and cannot be applied in disputes relating to the legality of interference with fundamental rights that results from measures originating from the State.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the foregoing analysis of Decision 2000/520 is borne out by the Commission\u2019s own assessment of the situation resulting from the implementation of that decision. Particularly in points\u00a02 and 3.2 of Communication COM(2013)\u00a0846 final and in points\u00a07.1, 7.2 and 8 of Communication COM(2013)\u00a0847 final, the content of which is set out in paragraphs\u00a013 to 16 and paragraphs\u00a022, 23 and 25 of the present judgment respectively, the Commission found that the United States authorities were able to access the personal data transferred from the Member States to the United States and process it in a way incompatible, in particular, with the purposes for which it was transferred, beyond what was strictly necessary and proportionate to the protection of national security. Also, the Commission noted that the data subjects had no administrative or judicial means of redress enabling, in particular, the data relating to them to be accessed and, as the case may be, rectified or erased.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms that is guaranteed within the European Union, EU legislation involving interference with the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter must, according to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of a measure and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose personal data is concerned have sufficient guarantees enabling their data to be effectively protected against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access and use of that data. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subjected to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to that data (judgment in \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraphs\u00a054 and 55 and the case-law cited).\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore and above all, protection of the fundamental right to respect for private life at EU level requires derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data to apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (judgment in \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a052 and the case-law cited).\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legislation is not limited to what is strictly necessary where it authorises, on a generalised basis, storage of all the personal data of all the persons whose data has been transferred from the European Union to the United States without any differentiation, limitation or exception being made in the light of the objective pursued and without an objective criterion being laid down by which to determine the limits of the access of the public authorities to the data, and of its subsequent use, for purposes which are specific, strictly restricted and capable of justifying the interference which both access to that data and its use entail (see, to this effect, concerning Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\u00a0March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC (OJ 2006 L\u00a0105, p.\u00a054), judgment in \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraphs\u00a057 to 61).\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, legislation permitting the public authorities to have access on a generalised basis to the content of electronic communications must be regarded as compromising the essence of the fundamental right to respect for private life, as guaranteed by Article\u00a07 of the Charter (see, to this effect, judgment in \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a039). \n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, legislation not providing for any possibility for an individual to pursue legal remedies in order to have access to personal data relating to him, or to obtain the rectification or erasure of such data, does not respect the essence of the fundamental right to effective judicial protection, as enshrined in Article\u00a047 of the Charter. The first paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter requires everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the European Union are violated to have the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal in compliance with the conditions laid down in that article. The very existence of effective judicial review designed to ensure compliance with provisions of EU law is inherent in the existence of the rule of law (see, to this effect, judgments in \nLes Verts\n v \nParliament\n, 294/83, EU:C:1986:166, paragraph\u00a023; \nJohnston\n, 222/84, EU:C:1986:206, paragraphs\u00a018 and 19; \nHeylens and Others\n, 222/86, EU:C:1987:442, paragraph\u00a014; and \nUGT-Rioja and Others\n, C-428/06 to C-434/06, EU:C:2008:488, paragraph\u00a080).\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As has been found in particular in paragraphs\u00a071, 73 and 74 of the present judgment, in order for the Commission to adopt a decision pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, it must find, duly stating reasons, that the third country concerned in fact ensures, by reason of its domestic law or its international commitments, a level of protection of fundamental rights essentially equivalent to that guaranteed in the EU legal order, a level that is apparent in particular from the preceding paragraphs of the present judgment.\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the Commission did not state, in Decision 2000/520, that the United States in fact \u2018ensures\u2019 an adequate level of protection by reason of its domestic law or its international commitments.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, without there being any need to examine the content of the safe harbour principles, it is to be concluded that Article\u00a01 of Decision 2000/520 fails to comply with the requirements laid down in Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, read in the light of the Charter, and that it is accordingly invalid.\n\u00a0Article\u00a03 of Decision 2000/520\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the considerations set out in paragraphs\u00a053, 57 and 63 of the present judgment that, under Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, read in the light in particular of Article\u00a08 of the Charter, the national supervisory authorities must be able to examine, with complete independence, any claim concerning the protection of a person\u2019s rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal data relating to him. That is in particular the case where, in bringing such a claim, that person raises questions regarding the compatibility of a Commission decision adopted pursuant to Article\u00a025(6) of that directive with the protection of the privacy and of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. \n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the first subparagraph of Article\u00a03(1) of Decision 2000/520 lays down specific rules regarding the powers available to the national supervisory authorities in the light of a Commission finding relating to an adequate level of protection, within the meaning of Article\u00a025 of Directive 95/46.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under that provision, the national supervisory authorities may, \u2018[w]ithout prejudice to their powers to take action to ensure compliance with national provisions adopted pursuant to provisions other than Article\u00a025 of Directive [95/46], \u2026 suspend data flows to an organisation that has self-certified its adherence to the [principles of Decision 2000/520]\u2019, under restrictive conditions establishing a high threshold for intervention. Whilst that provision is without prejudice to the powers of those authorities to take action to ensure compliance with national provisions adopted pursuant to Directive 95/46, it excludes, on the other hand, the possibility of them taking action to ensure compliance with Article\u00a025 of that directive.\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first subparagraph of Article\u00a03(1) of Decision 2000/520 must therefore be understood as denying the national supervisory authorities the powers which they derive from Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, where a person, in bringing a claim under that provision, puts forward matters that may call into question whether a Commission decision that has found, on the basis of Article\u00a025(6) of the directive, that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection is compatible with the protection of the privacy and of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The implementing power granted by the EU legislature to the Commission in Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46 does not confer upon it competence to restrict the national supervisory authorities\u2019 powers referred to in the previous paragraph of the present judgment.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, it must be held that, in adopting Article\u00a03 of Decision 2000/520, the Commission exceeded the power which is conferred upon it in Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, read in the light of the Charter, and that Article\u00a03 of the decision is therefore invalid.\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Articles\u00a01 and 3 of Decision 2000/520 are inseparable from Articles\u00a02 and 4 of that decision and the annexes thereto, their invalidity affects the validity of the decision in its entirety.\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, it is to be concluded that Decision 2000/520 is invalid.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data as amended by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29\u00a0September 2003, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as meaning that a decision adopted pursuant to that provision, such as Commission Decision 2000/520/EC of 26\u00a0July 2000 pursuant to Directive 95/46 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the safe harbour privacy principles and related frequently asked questions issued by the US Department of Commerce, by which the European Commission finds that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection, does not prevent a supervisory authority of a Member State, within the meaning of Article\u00a028 of that directive as amended, from examining the claim of a person concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal data relating to him which has been transferred from a Member State to that third country when that person contends that the law and practices in force in the third country do not ensure an adequate level of protection.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecision 2000/520 is invalid."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}
