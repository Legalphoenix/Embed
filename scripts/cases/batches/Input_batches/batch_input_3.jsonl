The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 1 Oct 2015, C-201/14 (\nBara and Others\n)\nGeneral data protection law

The ANAF transferred data relating to their declared income to the CNAS.\u00a0On the basis of that data, the CNAS required the payment of arrears of contributions to the health insurance regime.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicants in the main proceedings brought an appeal before the Curtea de Apel Cluj (Court of Appeal, Cluj), in which they challenged the lawfulness of the transfer of tax data relating to their income in the light of Directive 95/46. They submit that the personal data were, on the basis of a single internal protocol, transferred and used for purposes other than those for which it had initially been communicated to the ANAF, without their prior explicit consent and without their having previously been informed.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the order for reference, public bodies are empowered, under Law No\u00a095/2006, to transfer personal data to the health insurance funds so that the latter may determine whether an individual qualifies as an insured person. The data concern the identification of persons (surname, first name, personal identity card number, address) but does not include data relating to income received. \n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court wishes to determine whether the processing of the data by the CNAS required prior information to be given to the data subjects as to the identity of the data controller and the purpose for which the data was transferred. That court is also asked to determine whether the transfer of the data on the basis of the 2007 Protocol is contrary to Directive 95/46 which requires that all restrictions on the rights of data subjects are laid down by law and accompanied by safeguards, in particular when the data is used against those persons. \n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Curtea de Apel Cluj decided to stay proceedings and refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is a national tax authority, as the body representing the competent ministry of a Member State, a financial institution within the meaning of Article\u00a0124 TFEU?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible to make provision, by means of a measure akin to an administrative measure, namely a protocol concluded between the national tax authority and another State institution, for the transfer of the database relating to the income earned by the citizens of a Member State from the national tax authority to another institution of the Member State, without giving rise to a measure establishing privileged access, as defined in Article\u00a0124 TFEU? \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the transfer of the database, the purpose of which is to impose an obligation on the citizens of the Member State to pay social security contributions to the Member State institution for whose benefit the transfer is made, covered by the concept of prudential considerations within the meaning of Article\u00a0124 TFEU?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May personal data be processed by authorities for which such data were not intended where such an operation gives rise, retroactively, to financial loss?\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe questions referred\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility\n\u00a0Admissibility of the first to third questions\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to settled case-law, the Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its object, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (see judgment in \nPreussenElektra\n, C-379/98, EU:C:2001:160, paragraph\u00a039 and the case-law cited). \n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All of the observations presented to the Court submit that the first to third questions referred concerning the interpretation of Article\u00a0124 TFEU are inadmissible on the ground that they bear no relation to the object of the dispute in the main proceedings. \n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be recalled that Article\u00a0124 TFEU falls within Part\u00a0Three of the TFEU, under Title\u00a0VIII on economic and monetary policy. That article prohibits any measure, not based on prudential considerations, establishing privileged access by Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, central governments, regional, local or other public authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of Member States to financial institutions.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The origin of that prohibition is to be found in Article\u00a0104 A of the EC Treaty (which became Article\u00a0102 EC), which was inserted in the EC Treaty by the Treaty of Maastricht. It was one of the provisions of the TFEU relating to the economic policy that intended to encourage the Member States to follow a sound budgetary policy, not allowing monetary financing of public deficits or privileged access by public authorities to the financial markets to lead to excessively high levels of debt or excessive Member State deficits (see, to that effect, judgment in \nGauweiler and Others\n, C-62/14, EU:C:2015:400, paragraph\u00a0100).\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is, therefore, quite obvious that the interpretation of Article\u00a0124 TFEU requested bears no relation to the actual facts or object of the dispute in the main proceedings, which concerns the protection of personal data. \n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that it is not necessary to reply to the first to third questions.\n\u00a0Admissibility of the fourth question\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CNAS and the Romanian Government submit that the fourth question is inadmissible. That government submits that there is no link between the damage relied on by the applicants in the main proceedings and the annulment of the administrative acts contested within those proceedings. \n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, according to the settled case-law of the Court, questions on the interpretation of EU law referred by a national court in the factual and legislative context which that court is responsible for defining, the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court to determine, enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment in \nFish Legal and Shirley\n, C-279/12, EU:C:2013:853, paragraph\u00a030 and the case-law cited). \n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be observed that the main proceedings concern the lawfulness of processing of tax data collected by the ANAF.\u00a0The referring court is uncertain as to the interpretation of Directive 95/46, in the context of reviewing the lawfulness of the transfer of those data to the CNAS and their subsequent processing. The fourth question referred is therefore relevant and sufficiently precise to enable the Court to give a useful answer. Accordingly, the request for a preliminary ruling must be held to be admissible as regards the fourth question. \n\u00a0\nSubstance\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Articles\u00a010, 11 and 13 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as precluding national measures, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, which allow a public administrative body in a Member State to transfer personal data to another public administrative body and their subsequent processing, without the data subjects being informed of that transfer and processing.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be held, on the basis of the information provided by the referring court, that the tax data transferred to the CNAS by the ANAF are personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of the directive, since they are \u2018information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019 (judgment in \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a035). Both the transfer of the data by the ANAF, the body responsible for the management of the database in which they are held, and their subsequent processing by the CNAS therefore constitute \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) of the directive (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments in \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01, EU:C:2003:294, paragraph\u00a064, and \nHuber\n, C-524/06, EU:C:2008:724, paragraph\u00a043). \n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with the provisions of Chapter\u00a0II of Directive 95/46, entitled \u2018General rules on the lawfulness of the processing of personal data\u2019, subject to the exceptions permitted under Article\u00a013 of that directive, all processing of personal data must comply, first, with the principles relating to data quality set out in Article\u00a06 of the directive and, secondly, with one of the criteria for making data processing legitimate listed in Article\u00a07 of the directive (judgments in \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01, EU:C:2003:294, paragraph\u00a065; \nHuber\n, C-524/06, EU:C:2008:724, paragraph\u00a048; and \nASNEF and FECEMD\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraph\u00a026).\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the data controller or his representative is obliged to provide information in accordance with the requirements laid down in Articles\u00a010 and 11 of Directive 95/46, which vary depending on what data are, or are not, collected from the data subject, and subject to the exceptions permitted under Article\u00a013 of the directive.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, first, Article\u00a010 of the directive, that article provides that the data controller must provide a data subject, from whom data relating to himself are collected, with the information listed in subparagraphs (a) to (c), except where he already has that information. That information concerns the identity of the data controller, the purposes of the processing and any further information necessary to guarantee fair processing of the data. Amongst the additional information necessary to guarantee fair processing of the data, Article\u00a010(c) of the directive expressly refers to \u2018recipients or categories of recipients of the data\u2019 and \u2018the existence of a right of access to and the right to rectify the data concerning [that person]\u2019.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a074 of his Opinion, the requirement to inform the data subjects about the processing of their personal data is all the more important since it affects the exercise by the data subjects of their right of access to, and right to rectify, the data being processed, set out in Article\u00a012 of Directive 95/46, and their right to object to the processing of those data, set out in Article\u00a014 of that directive. \n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the requirement of fair processing of personal data laid down in Article\u00a06 of Directive 95/46 requires a public administrative body to inform the data subjects of the transfer of those data to another public administrative body for the purpose of their processing by the latter in its capacity as recipient of those data.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from the information provided by the referring court that the applicants in the main proceedings were not informed by the ANAF of the transfer to the CNAS of personal data relating to them.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Romanian Government submits, however, that the ANAF is required, in particular under Article\u00a0315 of Law No\u00a095/2006, to transfer to the regional health insurance funds the information necessary for the determination by the CNAS as to whether persons earning income through self-employment qualify as insured persons.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that Article\u00a0315 of Law No\u00a095/2006 expressly provides that \u2018the data necessary to certify that the person concerned qualifies as an insured person are to be communicated free of charge to the health insurance funds by the authorities, public institutions or other institutions in accordance with a protocol\u2019. However, it is clear from the explanations provided by the referring court that the data necessary for determining whether a person qualifies as an insured person, within the meaning of the abovementioned provision, do not include those relating to income, since the law also recognises persons without a taxable income as qualifying as insured.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, Article\u00a0315 of Law No\u00a095/2006 cannot constitute, within the meaning of Article\u00a010 of Directive 95/46, prior information enabling the data controller to dispense with his obligation to inform the persons from whom data relating to their income are collected as to the recipients of those data. Therefore, it cannot be held that the transfer at issue was carried out in compliance with Article\u00a010 of Directive 95/46.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is necessary to examine whether Article\u00a013 of the directive applies to that failure to inform the data subjects. It is apparent from Article\u00a013(1)(e) and (f) that Member States may restrict the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Article\u00a010 of the same directive when such a restriction constitutes a necessary measure to safeguard \u2018an important economic or financial interest of a Member State [\u2026], including monetary, budgetary and taxation matters\u2019 or \u2018a monitoring, inspection or regulatory function connected, even occasionally, with the exercise of official authority in cases referred to in (c), (d) and (e)\u2019. Nevertheless, Article\u00a013 expressly requires that such restrictions are imposed by legislative measures.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from the fact, noted by the referring court, that data relating to income are not part of the personal data necessary for the determination of whether a person is insured, it must be observed that Article\u00a0315 of Law No\u00a095/2006 merely envisages the principle of the transfer of personal data relating to income held by authorities, public institutions and other institutions. It is also apparent from the order for reference that the definition of transferable information and the detailed arrangements for transferring that information were laid down not in a legislative measure but in the 2007 Protocol agreed between the ANAF and the CNAS, which was not the subject of an official publication. \n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it cannot be concluded that the conditions laid down in Article\u00a013 of Directive 95/46 permitting a Member State to derogate from the rights and obligations flowing from Article\u00a010 of the directive are complied with. \n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the second place, Article\u00a011 of the directive, paragraph\u00a01 of that article provides that a controller of data which were not obtained from the data subject must provide the latter with the information listed in subparagraphs (a) to (c). That information concerns the identity of the data controller, the purposes of the processing, and any further information necessary to ensure the fair processing of the data. Amongst that further information, Article\u00a011(1)(c) of the directive refers expressly to \u2018the categories of data concerned\u2019 and \u2018the existence of the right of access to and the right to rectify the data concerning him\u2019.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in accordance with Article\u00a011(1)(b) and (c) of Directive 95/46, in the circumstances of the case in the main proceedings, the processing by the CNAS of the data transferred by the ANAF required that the subjects of the data be informed of the purposes of that processing and the categories of data concerned. \n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the information given by the referring court, however, that the CNAS did not provide the applicants in the main proceedings with the information listed in Article\u00a011(1)(a) to (c) of the directive. \n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is appropriate to add that, in accordance with Article\u00a011(2) of Directive 95/46, the provisions of Article\u00a011(1) of the directive do not apply when, in particular, the registration or communication of the data are laid down by law, Member States being required to provide appropriate safeguards in those cases. For the reasons set out in paragraphs\u00a040 and 41 of this judgment, the provisions of Law No\u00a095/2006 relied on by the Romanian Government and the 2007 Protocol do not establish a basis for applying either the derogation under Article\u00a011(2) or that provided for under Article\u00a013 of the directive. \n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Articles\u00a010, 11 and 13 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as precluding national measures, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, which allow a public administrative body of a Member State to transfer personal data to another public administrative body and their subsequent processing, without the data subjects having been informed of that transfer or processing. \n\u00a0\nCosts\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticles\u00a010, 11 and 13 of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995, on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, must be interpreted as precluding national measures, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, which allow a public administrative body of a Member State to transfer personal data to another public administrative body and their subsequent processing, without the data subjects having been informed of that transfer or processing."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

It requested the undertakings which assign telephone numbers to subscribers in the Netherlands (\u2018the Dutch undertakings\u2019) to make available to it data relating to their subscribers. Since those undertakings refused to provide the data requested, on 18 January 2012, EDA submitted a dispute resolution request to ACM.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decisions of 5 June 2013, ACM, as the national regulatory authority, took a decision on EDA\u2019s request by adopting the following measures. First, EDA can rely on Article\u00a03.1 of the Bude to the extent that it uses the numbers made available to it and the related information in order to place a standard telephone directory enquiry service about the subscribers on the market. Secondly, the Dutch undertakings must make available to EDA basic data relating to their subscribers (names, addresses, telephone numbers) on fair, objective, cost oriented and non-discriminatory terms. Third, the Dutch undertakings must ensure within a reasonable period of time that the consent which they seek from their subscribers when entering into contracts, with a view to including the data concerning them in any standard directory and any directory of subscribers which is used for a standard telephone directory enquiry service is compatible with the provisions of Article\u00a03.2 of the Bude.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Dutch undertakings brought an action against those decisions of ACM before the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven (Administrative Court of Appeal for Trade and Industry, Netherlands).\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states, in the first place, that, given that Article\u00a03.1 of the Bude transposed into Netherlands law Article\u00a025(2) of the Universal Service Directive, it is necessary to establish the scope of the latter provision in order to answer the question, which is disputed by the parties to the main proceedings, whether that Article\u00a03.1 requires Dutch undertakings to make available to EDA data relating to their subscribers despite the fact that EDA is not established in the Netherlands.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It notes, in that regard, that the interpretation of Article\u00a025(2) of that directive given by the Court in the judgment of 5 May 2011, \nDeutsche Telekom \n(C-543/09, EU:C:2011:279), does not involve the cross-border provision of data relating to subscribers and does not, consequently, answer the question whether that provision must be interpreted as meaning that an undertaking is required to make its data relating to subscribers available to a provider of directory enquiry services and directories established in another Member State.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, the referring court notes, concerning obtaining the subscriber\u2019s consent, that Article\u00a03.2 of the Bude provides that the provider is to obtain that consent to the inclusion of personal data and telephone numbers use of which it has assigned, in any standard directory and any directory of subscribers which is used for a standard telephone directory enquiry service. It points out that, according to the explanatory notes to Article\u00a03.2 of the Bude, \u2018the reason for that is to avoid a situation where every provider of publicly available telephone directories and directory enquiry services would have to obtain the consent of every subscriber individually for a standard listing\u2019.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court notes that the parties to the main proceedings dispute whether, first, Article\u00a03.2 of the Bude allows the consent of subscribers to the use of their personal data to be differentiated according to whether those data are intended for Dutch providers or for foreign providers of directory enquiry services and/or directories and, secondly, whether it is necessary to leave the subscribers with the choice whether or not to give their consent depending on the country in which the undertaking requesting information provides its services. In that regard, the referring court considers that the question arises, in essence, as to how to balance respect for the principle of non-discrimination and privacy in the context of that request for consent.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven (Administrative Court of Appeal for Trade and Industry) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article\u00a025(2) of the Universal Service Directive be interpreted as meaning that requests should be understood to include a request from an undertaking established in another Member State, which requests information for the purposes of the provision of publicly available telephone directory enquiry services and directories which are provided in that Member State and/or in other Member States?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If question 1 is answered in the affirmative: may a provider who makes telephone numbers available, and who is obliged under national legislation to request a subscriber\u2019s consent prior to inclusion [of his data] in standard telephone directories and standard directory enquiry services, differentiate in the request for consent on the basis of the non-discrimination principle according to the Member State in which the undertaking requesting the information as referred to in Article\u00a025(2) of Directive 2002/22/EC provides the telephone directory and directory enquiry service?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a025(2) of the Universal Service Directive must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018requests\u2019, in that article, covers also requests made by an undertaking, established in a Member State other than that in which the undertakings which assign telephone numbers to subscribers are established, which requests the relevant information possessed by those undertakings in order to provide publicly available telephone directory enquiry services and directories in that Member State and/or in other Member States.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a025 of the Universal Service Directive is in Chapter IV of that directive, which concerns end-user interests and rights. According to Article\u00a025(1) thereof, the Member States are to ensure that subscribers to publicly available telephone services have the right to have an entry in the publicly available directory referred to in Article\u00a05(1)(a) of that directive, and to have their information made available to providers of directory enquiry services and/or directories in accordance with Article\u00a025(2) of that directive.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concerning the making of information relating to subscribers available to providers of directory services and/or directories, it is apparent from the wording itself of Article\u00a025(2) of the Universal Service Directive that that provision covers all reasonable requests to make available data for the purposes of the provision of publicly available directory enquiry services and directories. Moreover, that provision requires that that information be made available in a non-discriminatory manner.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows therefore from that wording that that provision makes no distinction according to whether the request to make available data relating to subscribers is made by an undertaking established in the same Member State as that in which is established the undertaking to which the request is addressed or whether it is made by an undertaking established in a Member State other than that of the undertaking which received that request.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That lack of distinction is compatible with the objective pursued by the Universal Service Directive, which, according to Article\u00a01(1) thereof, seeks, in particular, to ensure the availability, throughout the European Union, of good quality publicly available services through effective competition and choice and to deal with circumstances in which the needs of end-users are not satisfactorily met by the market, and with the specific objective of Article\u00a025(2) of the Universal Service Directive which seeks, in particular, to ensure compliance with the universal service obligation laid down in Article\u00a05(1) of that directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 May 2011, \nDeutsche Telekom\n, C-543/09, EU:C:2011:279, paragraph\u00a035).\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court has already held, in paragraph\u00a036 of the judgment of 5 May 2011, \nDeutsche Telekom\n (C-543/09, EU:C:2011:279), referring to recital\u00a035 of the Universal Service Directive, that, in a competitive market, the obligation under Article\u00a025(2) of that directive for undertakings which assign telephone numbers to pass on data relating to their own subscribers in principle not only enables the designated undertaking to ensure compliance with the universal service obligation laid down in Article\u00a05(1) of that directive, but also enables any provider of telephone services to establish an exhaustive data base and to become active in the market for telephone directory enquiry services and directories. In that connection, it is sufficient that the provider concerned ask each undertaking assigning telephone numbers for the relevant data relating to its subscribers.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An interpretation of Article\u00a025(2) of the Universal Service Directive according to which that provision covers only reasonable requests made by undertakings established in the Member State in which the undertakings assigning telephone numbers to subscribers are established would be contrary to the objective of ensuring the availability, throughout the European Union, of good quality services to end-users thanks to effective competition and, in particular, to that of respecting the universal service obligation provided for in Article\u00a05(1) of the Universal Service Directive, resulting, in particular, from the need to make at least one complete telephone directory available to end-users.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, as was stated in paragraph\u00a024 of the present judgment, Article\u00a025(2) of the Universal Service Directive requires undertakings assigning telephone numbers to subscribers to meet all reasonable requests to make available, for the purposes of the provision of publicly available directory enquiry services and directories, the relevant information in a non-discriminatory manner. The refusal of undertakings assigning telephone numbers to subscribers in the Netherlands to make data relating to their subscribers available to persons requesting that information on the sole ground that they are established in another Member State is incompatible with that requirement.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the above considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a025(2) of the Universal Service Directive must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018requests\u2019 in that article, covers also requests made by an undertaking, established in a Member State other than that in which the undertakings which assign telephone numbers to subscribers are established, which requests the relevant information possessed by those undertakings in order to provide publicly available telephone directory enquiry services and directories in that Member State and/or in other Member States.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a025(2) of the Universal Service Directive must be interpreted as precluding an undertaking which assigns telephone numbers to subscribers, and which is obliged under national legislation to request those subscribers\u2019 consent to the use of data relating to them for the purposes of supplying directory enquiry services and directories, from differentiating in the request for those subscribers\u2019 consent to that use according to the Member State in which the undertakings requesting the information referred to in that provision provide those services.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a025(2) of the Universal Service Directive, the Member States are to ensure that all undertakings which assign telephone numbers to subscribers meet all reasonable requests for information to be made available, for the purposes of the provision of telephone directory enquiry services and telephone directories, on terms that must be fair, objective, cost oriented and non-discriminatory. Moreover, it is apparent from Article\u00a025(5) of that directive that Article\u00a025(2) thereof is to apply \u2018subject to the requirements of Union legislation on the protection of personal data and privacy and, in particular, Article\u00a012 of [the Directive on privacy and electronic communications]\u2019.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in order to answer the second question, it is necessary to examine also whether Article\u00a012(2) of that directive subjects the transfer, by an undertaking which assigns telephone numbers to its subscribers, of a subscriber\u2019s personal data to a third-party undertaking whose activity consists in providing publicly available directory enquiry services and directories in a Member State other than that in which that subscriber resides, to the latter\u2019s separate specific consent.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that the Court held, in paragraph\u00a067 of the judgment of 5 May 2011, \nDeutsche Telekom\n (C-543/09, EU:C:2011:279), that Article\u00a012 of that directive must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation under which an undertaking publishing public directories must pass personal data in its possession relating to subscribers of other telephone service providers to a third-party undertaking whose activity consists in publishing a printed or electronic public directory or making such directories obtainable through directory enquiry services and which does not make the passing on of those data conditional on renewed consent from the subscribers. However, first, those subscribers must be informed, before the first inclusion of their data in a public directory, of the purpose of that directory and of the fact that those data may be communicated to another telephone service provider and, secondly, it must be guaranteed that those data will not, once passed on, be used for purposes other than those for which they were collected with a view to their first publication.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of reaching that conclusion, the Court held, in the light of recital\u00a039 and of the wording of Article\u00a012(2) and (3) of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications, that, where a subscriber has been informed by the undertaking which assigned him a telephone number of the possibility that his personal data may be passed to a third-party undertaking, with a view to being published in a public directory, and where he has consented to the publication of those data in such a directory, renewed consent is not needed from the subscriber for the passing of those same data to another undertaking which intends to publish a printed or electronic public directory, or to make such directories available for consultation through directory enquiry services, if it is guaranteed that the data in question will not be used for purposes other than those for which the data were collected with a view to their first publication. The consent given under Article\u00a012(2) of that directive, by a subscriber who has been duly informed, to the publication of his personal data in a public directory relates to the purpose of that publication and thus extends to any subsequent processing of those data by third-party undertakings active in the market for publicly available directory enquiry services and directories, provided that such processing pursues that same purpose. The Court has stated in that regard that the wording of Article\u00a012(2) of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications does not support the inference that the subscriber has a selective right to decide in favour of certain providers of publicly available directory enquiry services and directories (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 May 2011, \nDeutsche Telekom\n, C-543/09, EU:C:2011:279, paragraphs\u00a062 to 65).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has added that, where a subscriber has consented to the passing of his personal data to a given undertaking with a view to their publication in a public directory of that undertaking, the passing of the same data to another undertaking intending to publish a public directory without renewed consent having been obtained from that subscriber is not capable of substantively impairing the right to protection of personal data, as recognised by Article\u00a08 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 May 2011, \nDeutsche Telekom\n, C-543/09, EU:C:2011:279, paragraph\u00a066).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that it is the purpose of the first publication of the subscriber\u2019s personal data to which he gave his consent which is decisive for the purposes of determining the scope of that consent. It should be noted, in that regard, that Article\u00a012(3) of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications provides that the Member States may require the consent of subscribers to be obtained also in respect of any purpose of a public directory other than the simple search of contact details of persons on the basis of their name and, where necessary, a limited number of other identifiers.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it should be noted that, regardless of where they are established in the European Union, undertakings which provide publicly available telephone directory enquiry services and directories operate within a highly harmonised regulatory framework making it possible to ensure throughout the European Union the same respect for requirements relating to the protection of subscribers\u2019 personal data, resulting in particular from Article\u00a025(5) of the Universal Service Directive and Article\u00a01(1) and Article\u00a012 of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, as the Advocate General stated in points\u00a040 and 41 of his Opinion, there is no need to establish a difference in treatment according to whether the undertaking requesting the transfer of personal data relating to subscribers is established in the territory of those subscribers\u2019 Member State or in another Member State, since that undertaking collects that data for purposes identical to those for which it was collected with a view to its first publication and, consequently, that transfer is covered by the consent that was given by those subscribers.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, in the light of those considerations and those set out in paragraphs\u00a023 to 30 of the present judgment, it is not necessary for the undertaking assigning telephone numbers to its subscribers to differentiate in the request for consent addressed to the subscriber according to the Member State to which the data concerning him could be sent.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the above considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a025(2) of the Universal Service Directive must be interpreted as precluding an undertaking which makes telephone numbers available to subscribers, and which is obliged under national legislation to request those subscribers\u2019 consent to the use of data relating to them for the purposes of supplying directory enquiry services and directories, from differentiating in the request for those subscribers\u2019 consent to that use according to the Member State in which the undertakings requesting the information referred to in that provision provide those services.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a025(2) of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users\u2019 rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009, must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018requests\u2019 in that article, covers also requests made by an undertaking, established in a Member State other than that in which the undertakings which assign telephone numbers to subscribers are established, which requests the relevant information possessed by those undertakings in order to provide publicly available telephone directory enquiry services and directories in that Member State and/or in other Member States.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a025(2) of Directive 2002/22, as amended by Directive 2009/136, must be interpreted as precluding an undertaking which assigns telephone numbers to subscribers, and which is obliged under national legislation to request those subscribers\u2019 consent to the use of data relating to them for the purposes of supplying directory enquiry services and directories, from differentiating in the request for those subscribers\u2019 consent to that use according to the Member State in which the undertakings requesting the information referred to in that provision provide those services."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law.

A Member State may provide for such a body, organisation or association to have the right to lodge a complaint in that Member State, independently of a data subject\u2019s mandate, and the right to an effective judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider that the rights of a data subject have been infringed as a result of the processing of personal data which infringes this Regulation.

Facebook Germany GmbH, which has its registered office in Germany, promotes the sale of advertising space at the internet address www.facebook.de. The Facebook internet platform contains, inter alia, at the internet address www.facebook.de, an area called \u2018App-Zentrum\u2019 (\u2018App Center\u2019) on which Meta Platforms Ireland makes available to users free games provided by third parties. When consulting the App Center of some of those games, an indication appears informing the user that the use of the application concerned enables the gaming company to obtain a certain amount of personal data and, by that use, permission is given for it to publish data on behalf of that user, such as his or her score and other information. The consequence of that use is that the user accepts the general terms and conditions of the application and its data protection policy. In addition, in the case of a specific game, it is stated that the application has permission to post the status, photos and other information on behalf of that user.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Union, a body which has standing under Paragraph\u00a04 of the Law on Injunctions, considers that the information provided by the games concerned in the App Center is unfair, in particular in terms of the failure to comply with the legal requirements which apply to the obtention of valid consent from the user under the provisions governing data protection. Moreover, it considers that the statement that \n\u00a0\nthe application has permission to publish certain personal information of the user on his or her behalf constitutes a general condition which unduly disadvantages the user.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the Federal Union brought an action for an injunction before the Landgericht Berlin (Regional Court, Berlin, Germany) against Meta Platforms Ireland based on Paragraph\u00a03a of the Law against unfair competition, the first sentence of point\u00a011 of Paragraph\u00a02(2) of the Law on Injunctions and the Civil Code. It brought that action independently of a specific infringement of a data subject\u2019s right to protection of his or her data and without being mandated to do so by such a person.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Landgericht Berlin (Regional Court, Berlin) ruled against Meta Platforms Ireland, in accordance with the form of order sought by the Federal Union. The appeal brought by Meta Platforms Ireland before the Kammergericht Berlin (Higher Regional Court, Berlin, Germany) was dismissed. Meta Platforms Ireland then brought an appeal on a point of law (\nRevision\n) before the referring court against the dismissal decision adopted by the Kammergericht Berlin (Higher Regional Court, Berlin).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court considers that the action brought by the Federal Union is well founded, in so far as Meta Platforms Ireland infringed Paragraph\u00a03a of the Law against unfair competition and the first sentence of point\u00a011 of Paragraph\u00a02(2) of the Law on Injunctions, and used an invalid general condition, within the meaning of Paragraph\u00a01 of the Law on Injunctions.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, that court has doubts as to the admissibility of the action brought by the Federal Union. It takes the view that it cannot be ruled out that the Federal Union, which did indeed have standing to bring proceedings on the date on which it brought the action\u00a0\u2013 on the basis of Paragraph\u00a08(3) of the Law against unfair competition and point\u00a01 of the first sentence of Paragraph\u00a03(1) of the Law on Injunctions\u00a0\u2013 lost that status during the proceedings, following the entry into force of the GDPR and, in particular, Article\u00a080(1) and (2) and Article\u00a084(1) thereof. If that were the case, the referring court would have to uphold the appeal on a point of law brought by Meta Platforms Ireland and dismiss the action of the Federal Union, since, under German procedural law, standing to bring proceedings must endure until the end of the proceedings at last instance.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, the answer in that regard is not clear from the assessment of the wording, scheme and objectives of the provisions of the GDPR.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the wording of the provisions of the GDPR, the referring court notes that the existence of standing to bring proceedings of not-for-profit bodies, organisations or associations which have been properly constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, pursuant to Article\u00a080(1) of the GDPR, presupposes that the data subject has mandated a body, organisation or association for it to exercise on his or her behalf the rights referred to in Articles\u00a077 to 79 of the GDPR and the right to compensation referred to in Article\u00a082 of the GDPR where the law of a Member State so provides.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states that standing to bring proceedings under Paragraph\u00a08(3)(3) of the Law against unfair competition does not cover such an action brought on the basis of a mandate and on behalf of a data subject in order to assert his or her personal rights. On the contrary, it confers on an association, by virtue of a right peculiar to it and stemming from Paragraph\u00a03(1) and Paragraph\u00a03a of the Law against unfair competition, standing to bring proceedings on an objective basis against infringements of the provisions of the GDPR, independently of the infringement of specific rights of data subjects and of a mandate conferred by them.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the referring court observes that Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR does not provide for an association\u2019s standing to bring proceedings in order to secure the application, objectively, of the law on the protection of personal data since that provision presupposes that the rights of a data subject laid down in the GDPR have actually been infringed as a result of the processing of specific data.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, an association\u2019s standing to bring proceedings, such as that provided for in Paragraph\u00a08(3) of the Law against unfair competition, cannot result from Article\u00a084(1) of the GDPR, under which the Member States are to lay down the rules on other penalties applicable to infringements of that regulation and are to take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The standing of an association, such as that referred to in Paragraph\u00a08(3) of the Law against unfair competition, cannot be regarded as constituting a \u2018penalty\u2019 within the meaning of that provision of the GDPR.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the scheme of the provisions of the GDPR, the referring court considers that it may be inferred from the fact that it harmonised, inter alia, the powers of the supervisory authorities that it is principally for those authorities to verify the application of the provisions of that regulation. However, the expression \u2018without prejudice to any other\u00a0\u2026 remedy\u2019, which appears in Article\u00a077(1), Article\u00a078(1) and (2) and Article\u00a079(1) of the GDPR, may undermine the argument that oversight of the application of the law is exhaustively governed by that regulation.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objective of the provisions of the GDPR, the referring court notes that the effectiveness of that regulation may support an argument in favour of associations having standing to bring proceedings on the basis of competition law, in accordance with Paragraph\u00a08(3)(3) of the Law against unfair competition, independently of the infringement of specific rights of data subjects, since that would allow an additional opportunity to supervise the application of the law to remain, in order to ensure as high a level as possible of protection of personal data, in accordance with recital\u00a010 of the GDPR. Nonetheless, accepting that associations have standing to bring proceedings under competition law may be considered to run counter to the objective of harmonisation pursued by the GDPR.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of those considerations, the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018Do the rules in Chapter\u00a0VIII, in particular in Article\u00a080(1) and (2) and Article\u00a084(1), of [the GDPR] preclude national rules which\u00a0\u2013 alongside the powers of intervention of the supervisory authorities responsible for monitoring and enforcing the Regulation and the options for legal redress for data subjects\u00a0\u2013 empower, on the one hand, competitors and, on the other, associations, entities and chambers entitled under national law, to bring proceedings for breaches of [the GDPR], independently of the infringement of specific rights of individual data subjects and without being mandated to do so by a data subject, against [the person responsible for that infringement] before the civil courts on the basis of the prohibition of unfair commercial practices or breach of a consumer protection law or the prohibition of the use of invalid general terms and conditions?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the question referred\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, as is apparent, in particular, from paragraph\u00a036 and from paragraphs\u00a041 to 44 above, the dispute in the main proceedings is between a consumer protection association, such as the Federal Union, and Meta Platforms Ireland and concerns the question whether such an association may bring proceedings against that company in the absence of a mandate granted to it for that purpose and independently of the infringement of specific rights of the data subjects.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, as the Commission correctly observed in its written observations, the answer to the question referred for a preliminary ruling depends solely on the interpretation of Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR, since the provisions of Article\u00a080(1) of the GDPR and of Article\u00a084 of the GDPR are not relevant in the present case. First, the application of Article\u00a080(1) of the GDPR presupposes that the data subject has mandated the not-for-profit body, organisation or association referred to in that provision to take on his or her behalf the legal measures provided for in Articles\u00a077 to 79 of the GDPR. It is common ground that that is not the case in the main proceedings, since the Federal Union acts independently of any mandate from a data subject. Second, it is common ground that Article\u00a084 of the GDPR concerns the administrative and criminal penalties applicable to infringements of that regulation, which is also not at issue in the main proceedings.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it should be noted that the case in the main proceedings does not raise the question of a competitor\u2019s standing to bring proceedings. Consequently, it is only necessary to answer the part of the question which relates to the standing to bring proceedings of associations, bodies and chambers authorised under national law, referred to in Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the question referred by the referring court must be understood as seeking to ascertain, in essence, whether Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which allows a consumer protection association to bring legal proceedings, in the absence of a mandate conferred on it for that purpose and independently of the infringement of specific rights of a data subject, against the person allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data, by alleging infringement of the prohibition of unfair commercial practices, consumer protection legislation or the prohibition of the use of invalid general terms and conditions.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer that question, it must be borne in mind that, as is apparent from recital\u00a010 of the GDPR, that regulation seeks, inter alia, to ensure consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union and to remove obstacles to flows of personal data within the European Union.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, Chapter\u00a0VIII of that regulation governs, inter alia, the legal remedies enabling the protection of the data subject\u2019s rights where his or her personal data have been the subject of processing that is allegedly contrary to the provisions of that regulation. The protection of those rights may thus be sought either directly by the data subject or by an authorised entity, whether there is a mandate to that end or not, pursuant to Article\u00a080 of the GDPR.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, first of all, the data subject has the right to lodge a complaint himself or herself\n\u00a0\nwith a supervisory authority of a Member State or to bring an action before the national civil courts. More specifically, that data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in accordance with Article\u00a077 of the GDPR, the right to an effective judicial remedy against a supervisory authority, pursuant to Article\u00a078 of the GDPR, the right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor, provided for in Article\u00a079 of the GDPR, and the right to obtain from the controller or processor compensation for the harm suffered, under Article\u00a082 of the GDPR.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, in accordance with Article\u00a080(1) of the GDPR, the data subject has the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association, subject to certain conditions, to lodge a complaint on his or her behalf or to exercise the rights referred to in the articles referred to above on his or her behalf.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR, Member States may provide that any body, organisation or association, independently of a data subject\u2019s mandate granted by a data subject, has the right to lodge, in the Member State in question, a complaint with the supervisory authority, pursuant to Article\u00a077 of that regulation, and to exercise the rights referred to in Articles\u00a078 and 79 thereof, if it considers that the rights of a data subject under that regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of personal data concerning him or her.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, as is apparent from Article\u00a01(1) of the GDPR, read in the light, inter alia, of recitals\u00a09, 10 and 13 thereof, that regulation seeks to ensure the harmonisation of national legislation on the protection of personal data which is, in principle, full. However, the provisions of that regulation make it possible for Member States to lay down additional, stricter or derogating national rules, which leave them a margin of discretion as to the manner in which those provisions may be implemented (\u2018opening clauses\u2019).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be recalled that, according to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, pursuant to Article\u00a0288 TFEU and by virtue of the very nature of regulations and of their function in the system of sources of EU law, the provisions of those regulations generally have immediate effect in the national legal systems without it being necessary for the national authorities to adopt measures of application. Nonetheless, some of those provisions may necessitate, for their implementation, the adoption of measures of application by the Member States (judgment of 15\u00a0June 2021, \nFacebook Ireland and Others\n, C-645/19, EU:C:2021:483, paragraph\u00a0110 and the case-law cited).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is the case, inter alia, of Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR, which leaves the Member States a discretion with regard to its implementation. Thus, in order for it to be possible to proceed with the representative action without a mandate provided for in that provision, Member States must make use of the option made available to them by that provision to provide in their national law for that mode of representation of data subjects.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as the Advocate General observed, in points\u00a051 and 52 of his Opinion, when the Member States exercise the option granted to them by such an opening clause, they must use their discretion under the conditions and within the limits laid down by the provisions of the GDPR and must therefore legislate in such a way as not to undermine the content and objectives of that regulation.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this instance, as was confirmed by the German Government at the hearing in the present case, the German legislature did not adopt, following the entry into force of the GDPR, particular provisions specifically designed to implement Article\u00a080(2) of that regulation in its national law. The national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, adopted in order to transpose Directive 2009/22, already allows consumer protection associations to bring legal proceedings against the person allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data. That government observes, moreover, that, in its judgment of 29\u00a0July 2019, \nFashion ID \n(C-40/17, EU:C:2019:629), concerning the interpretation of the provisions of Directive 95/46, the Court held that those provisions do not preclude that national legislation.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a060 of his Opinion, it is necessary, in essence, to ascertain whether the national rules at issue in the main proceedings fall within the scope of the discretion conferred on each Member State by Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR and thus to interpret that provision taking into account its wording and the scheme and objectives of that regulation.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR allows Member States to provide for a representative action mechanism against the person allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data, while setting out a number of requirements at the level of the personal and material scope which must be complied with for that purpose.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the first place, the personal scope of such a mechanism, standing to bring proceedings is conferred on a body, organisation or association which meets the criteria set out in Article\u00a080(1) of the GDPR. In particular, that provision refers to \u2018not-for-profit body, organisation or association which has been properly constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, has statutory objectives which are in the public interest, and is active in the field of the protection of data subjects\u2019 rights and freedoms with regard to the protection of their personal data\u2019.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be held that a consumer protection association, such as the Federal Union, may fall within the scope of that concept in that it pursues a public interest objective consisting in safeguarding the rights and freedoms of data subjects in their capacity as consumers, since the attainment of such an objective is likely to be related to the protection of the personal data of those persons.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The infringement of the rules intended to protect consumers or to combat unfair commercial practices\u00a0\u2013 infringement which a consumer protection association, such as the Federal Union, aims to prevent and penalise, inter alia by recourse to actions for an injunction provided for in the applicable national legislation\u00a0\u2013 may be related, as in the present case, to the infringement of the rules on the protection of personal data of those consumers.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the second place, the material scope of that mechanism, the exercise of the representative action provided for in Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR by an entity meeting the conditions referred to in paragraph\u00a01 of that article presupposes that that entity, independently of any mandate conferred on it, \u2018considers that the rights of a data subject under [that r]egulation have been infringed as a result of the processing\u2019 of his or her personal data.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be stated, first, that for the purposes of bringing a representative action, within the meaning of Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR, such an entity cannot be required to carry out a prior individual identification of the \n\u00a0\nperson specifically concerned by data processing that is allegedly contrary to the provisions of the GDPR.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is sufficient to note that the concept of \u2018data subject\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of that regulation, covers not only an \u2018identified natural person\u2019, but also an \u2018identifiable natural person\u2019, namely a natural person \u2018who can be identified\u2019, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as, inter alia, a name, an identification number, location data or an online identifier. In those circumstances, the designation of a category or group of persons affected by such treatment may also be sufficient for the purpose of bringing such representative action.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, under Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR, the bringing of a representative action is also not subject to the existence of a specific infringement of the rights which a person derives from the data protection rules.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from the very wording of that provision, recalled in paragraph\u00a067 of the present judgment, the lodging of a representative action presupposes only that the entity concerned \u2018considers\u2019 that the rights of a data subject laid down in that regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of his or her personal data and therefore alleges the existence of data processing that is contrary to the provisions of that regulation.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in order to recognise that such an entity has standing to bring proceedings under that provision, it is sufficient to claim that the data processing concerned is liable to affect the rights which identified or identifiable natural persons derive from that regulation, without it being necessary to prove actual harm suffered by the data subject, in a given situation, by the infringement of his or her rights.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such an interpretation is consistent with the requirements stemming from Article\u00a016 TFEU and Article\u00a08 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and, thus, with the objective pursued by the GDPR consisting in ensuring effective protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, of ensuring a high level of protection of the right of every person to the protection of personal data concerning him or her (see, to that effect, judgment of 15\u00a0June 2021, \nFacebook Ireland and Others\n, C-645/19, EU:C:2021:483, paragraphs\u00a044, 45 and 91).\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Authorising consumer protection associations, such as the Federal Union, to bring, by means of a representative action mechanism, actions seeking to have processing contrary to the provisions of that regulation brought to an end, independently of the infringement of the rights of a person individually and specifically affected by that infringement, undoubtedly contributes to strengthening the rights of data subjects and ensuring that they enjoy a high level of protection.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it should be noted that the bringing of such a representative action, in so far as it makes it possible to prevent a large number of infringements of the rights of data subjects by the processing of their personal data, could prove more effective than the action that a single person individually and specifically affected by an infringement of his or her right to the protection of his or her personal data may bring against the person responsible for that infringement.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a076 of his Opinion, the preventive function of actions brought by consumer protection associations, such as the Federal Union, could not be guaranteed if the representative action provided for in Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR allowed only the infringement of the rights of a person individually and specifically affected by that infringement to be invoked.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, it is still necessary to ascertain, as requested by the referring court, whether Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR precludes the bringing of a representative action independently of a specific infringement of a right of a data subject and of a mandate conferred by that data subject, where infringement of data protection rules has been alleged in the context of an action seeking to review the application of other legal rules intended to ensure consumer protection.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted at the outset that, as has been observed, in essence, in paragraph\u00a066 of the present judgment, the infringement of a rule relating to the protection of personal data may at the same time give rise to an infringement of rules on consumer protection or unfair commercial practices.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a072 of his Opinion, that provision does not preclude the Member States from exercising the option it offers them in that consumer protection associations are entitled to take action against infringements of the rights provided for by the GDPR through, as the case may be, rules intended to protect consumers or combat unfair commercial practices, such as those provided for by Directive 2005/29 and Directive 2009/22.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation of Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR is moreover supported by Directive 2020/1828 which repeals and replaces, as from 25\u00a0June 2023, Directive 2009/22. In that context, it must be observed that, in accordance with Article\u00a02(1) thereof, Directive 2020/1828 applies to representative actions brought in relation to traders\u2019 infringements of the provisions of EU law referred to in Annex\u00a0I of that directive, which mentions the GDPR in point\u00a056.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that Directive 2020/1828 is not applicable in the context of the dispute in the main proceedings and its transposition deadline has not yet expired. However, it contains several elements which confirm that Article\u00a080 of the GDPR does not preclude the bringing of additional representative actions in the field of consumer protection.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although, as is apparent from recital\u00a011 of that directive, it remains possible to provide a procedural mechanism for additional representative actions in the field of consumer protection, the application mechanisms provided for in the GDPR or based on that regulation, such as that provided for in Article\u00a080 of that regulation, cannot be replaced or amended, as stated in recital\u00a015 of that directive, and they may thus be used to protect the collective interests of consumers.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Article\u00a080(2) of the GDPR must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which allows a consumer protection association to bring legal proceedings, in the absence of a mandate conferred on it for that purpose and independently of the infringement of specific rights of the data subjects, against the person allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data, on the basis of the infringement of the prohibition of unfair commercial practices, a breach of a consumer protection law or the prohibition of the use of invalid general terms and conditions, where the data processing concerned is liable to affect the rights that identified or identifiable natural persons derive from that regulation.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a080(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which allows a consumer protection association to bring legal proceedings, in the absence of a mandate conferred on it for that purpose and independently of the infringement of specific rights of the data subjects, against the person allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data, on the basis of the infringement of the prohibition of unfair commercial practices, a breach of a consumer protection law or the prohibition of the use of invalid general terms and conditions, where the data processing concerned is liable to affect the rights that identified or identifiable natural persons derive from that regulation."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Article\u00a03 of that directive, headed \u2018Scope\u2019, was worded as follows:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive shall apply to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means, and to the processing otherwise than by automatic means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive shall not apply to the processing of personal data:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles\u00a0V and VI of the [EU Treaty, in the version in force prior to the Treaty of Lisbon,] and in any case to processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the processing operation relates to State security matters) and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law,\n\u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe GDPR\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a01, 4, 10, 16, 19, 39, 50 and 154 of the GDPR state:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right. Article\u00a08(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the \u2018Charter\u2019) and Article\u00a016(1) [TFEU] provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\n\u2026\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.\n\u2026\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms or the free flow of personal data related to activities which fall outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national security. This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the Union.\n\u2026\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and the free movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal act. This Regulation should not, therefore, apply to processing activities for those purposes. However, personal data processed by public authorities under this Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union legal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0[of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (OJ 2016 L\u00a0119, p.\u00a089)].\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data.\u00a0\u2026 Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(50)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. In such a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is required. If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(154)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation allows the principle of public access to official documents to be taken into account when applying this Regulation. Public access to official documents may be considered to be in the public interest. Personal data in documents held by a public authority or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed by that authority or body if the disclosure is provided for by Union or Member State law to which the public authority or public body is subject. Such laws should reconcile public access to official documents and the reuse of public sector information with the right to the protection of personal data and may therefore provide for the necessary reconciliation with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The reference to public authorities and bodies should in that context include all authorities or other bodies covered by Member State law on public access to documents.

In accordance with Article\u00a032(3) of that law, a legal provision which the Latvijas Republikas Satversmes tiesa (Constitutional Court) has declared to be inconsistent with a higher-ranking rule of law is treated as void from the day of publication of the judgment of that court, unless the court decides otherwise.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0B is a natural person upon whom penalty points were imposed on account of one or more road traffic offences. In accordance with the Law on road traffic and Regulation No\u00a0551 of 21\u00a0June 2004, the Ce\u013cu satiksmes dro\u0161\u012bbas direkcija (Road Safety Directorate, Latvia) (\u2018the CSDD\u2019) entered those penalty points in the national register of vehicles and their drivers.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the information relating to those penalty points that was contained in the register was accessible to the public and moreover, according to B, had been disclosed, for purposes of re-use, to a number of economic operators, B lodged a constitutional complaint with the Latvijas Republikas Satversmes tiesa (Constitutional Court), in order for it to examine whether Article\u00a0141(2) of the Law on road traffic is consistent with the fundamental right to respect for private life laid down in Article\u00a096 of the Latvian Constitution.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Latvijas Republikas Saeima (Parliament of the Republic of Latvia; \u2018the Latvian Parliament\u2019) was involved in the proceedings as the institution which had adopted the Law on road traffic. In addition, the CSDD, which processes the data relating to penalty points imposed for road traffic offences, was heard, as were the Datu valsts inspekcija (data protection authority), which is the supervisory authority, within the meaning of Article\u00a051 of the GDPR, in Latvia, and a number of other authorities and persons.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the context of the main proceedings, the Latvian Parliament confirmed that, under Article\u00a0141(2) of the Law on road traffic, any person may obtain information relating to penalty points imposed on another person, either by enquiring directly at the CSDD or by using the services provided by commercial re-users.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It stated that that provision is lawful because it is justified by the objective of improving road safety. That public interest requires that persons infringing traffic regulations, in particular those disregarding them systematically and in bad faith, be openly identified and that drivers of vehicles, by means of that transparency, be deterred from committing offences.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, that provision is justified by the right of access to information, laid down by the Latvian Constitution.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Latvian Parliament explained that, in practice, disclosure of the information contained in the national register of vehicles and their drivers is subject to the condition that the person requesting the information must provide the national identification number of the driver about whom he or she wishes to enquire. This precondition for obtaining information is attributable to the fact that, unlike the person\u2019s name, which may be identical to the name of other persons, the national identification number is a unique identifier.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CSDD pointed out that Article\u00a0141(2) of the Law on road traffic does not impose any limits on either public access to or re-use of data relating to penalty points. As regards the contracts which it concludes with commercial re-users, the CSDD stated that they do not provide for legal transfer of the data and that re-users must ensure that the information transmitted to their customers does not exceed that which can be obtained from the CSDD. In addition, under those contracts the acquirer affirms that it will use the information obtained in accordance with the purposes indicated in the contract and in compliance with the legislation in force.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Datu valsts inspekcija (data protection authority) expressed its doubts as to whether Article\u00a0141(2) of the Law on road traffic is consistent with Article\u00a096 of the Latvian Constitution which lays down the right to respect for private life. In its view, the importance and the objective of processing carried out on the basis of the provision at issue in the main proceedings are not clearly established, and it cannot therefore be ruled out that that processing is inappropriate or disproportionate. Whilst the statistics relating to road traffic accidents in Latvia show a decrease in the number of accidents, there is, however, no proof that the penalty points system and public access to information relating to it have contributed to that favourable development.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Latvijas Republikas Satversmes tiesa (Constitutional Court) notes, first of all, that the constitutional complaint concerns Article\u00a0141(2) of the Law on road traffic only in so far as that provision makes penalty points entered in the national register of vehicles and their drivers accessible to the public.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It observes, next, that penalty points are personal data and that, when assessing the right to respect for private life laid down in Article\u00a096 of the Latvian Constitution, account is to be taken of the GDPR and, more generally, of Article\u00a016 TFEU and Article\u00a08 of the Charter.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objectives of the Latvian road traffic legislation, that court explains that it is in particular in order to promote road safety that offences committed by drivers, which are classified as administrative offences in Latvia, are entered in the register of convictions and that penalty points are entered in the national register of vehicles and their drivers.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns, in particular, the national register of vehicles and their drivers, it states that that register enables the number of road traffic offences committed to be ascertained and measures to be implemented in the light of their number. The system relating to penalty points entered in that register is thus intended to improve road safety, first, by enabling drivers of vehicles who disregard the road traffic rules systematically and in bad faith to be distinguished from drivers who commit offences occasionally. Second, such a system is also capable of influencing the conduct of road users in a preventive manner, by encouraging them to comply with the road traffic rules.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court observes that it is not in dispute that Article\u00a0141(2) of the Law on road traffic grants any person the right to request and obtain from the CSDD the information contained in the national register of vehicles and their drivers concerning the penalty points imposed on drivers. It confirms that, in practice, the information is provided to the person requesting it once that person indicates the national identification number of the driver concerned.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Latvijas Republikas Satversmes tiesa (Constitutional Court) then explains that, since penalty points are classified as publicly accessible information, they fall within the scope of the Law on freedom of information and that that information may therefore be re-used for commercial or non-commercial purposes other than the initial purpose for which the information was created.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to interpret and apply Article\u00a096 of the Latvian Constitution consistently with EU law, that court seeks to ascertain, first, whether information relating to penalty points is among the information referred to in Article\u00a010 of the GDPR, that is to say, \u2018personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences\u2019. If it is, the view could be taken that Article\u00a0141(2) of the Law on road traffic fails to comply with the requirement contained in Article\u00a010 of the GDPR that processing of the data to which that article relates can take place only \u2018under the control of official authority\u2019 or if there are \u2018appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects\u2019.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court states that Article\u00a08(5) of Directive 95/46, which left it to each Member State to determine whether the special rules on data relating to offences and criminal convictions should be extended to data relating to administrative offences and sanctions, was, from 1\u00a0September 2007, implemented in Latvia in such a way that personal data relating to administrative offences could, like data relating to criminal offences and convictions, be processed only by the persons, and in the circumstances, provided for by law.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It adds that the scope of Article\u00a010 of the GDPR must, in accordance with recital\u00a04 of that regulation, be assessed in the light of the function of fundamental rights in society. In that respect, the objective of preventing a previous conviction from having an excessive adverse effect on a person\u2019s private and professional life could apply both to criminal convictions and to administrative offences. Account should be taken, in this context, of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights on the equiparation of certain administrative cases with criminal cases.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Latvijas Republikas Satversmes tiesa (Constitutional Court) raises, second, the question of the scope of Article\u00a05 of the GDPR. It is unsure, in particular, whether the Latvian legislature has complied with the obligation, set out in Article\u00a05(1)(f), requiring personal data to be processed with \u2018integrity and confidentiality\u2019. It points out that Article\u00a0141(2) of the Law on road traffic, which, by giving access to information relating to penalty points, makes it possible to ascertain whether a person has been found guilty of a road traffic offence, was not accompanied by specific measures ensuring the security of such data.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court seeks, third, to ascertain whether Directive 2003/98 is relevant when examining whether Article\u00a0141(2) of the Law on road traffic is compatible with the right to respect for private life. It is apparent from that directive that the re-use of personal data may be permitted only if that right is respected.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, in the light of the Court of Justice\u2019s case-law according to which the interpretation of EU law provided in preliminary rulings has \nerga omnes \n and \nex tunc\n effects, the Latvijas Republikas Satversmes tiesa (Constitutional Court) is uncertain whether, if Article\u00a0141(2) of the Law on road traffic were to be incompatible with Article\u00a096 of the Latvian Constitution, read in the light of the GDPR and the Charter, it could nevertheless maintain the temporal effects of Article\u00a0141(2) of that law until the date of delivery of its judgment, given the large number of legal relationships at issue.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It states that, under Latvian law, a measure that it declares unconstitutional is to be considered void from the day of delivery of its judgment, unless it decides otherwise. It explains that it must, in that regard, strike a balance between the principle of legal certainty and the fundamental rights of the various parties concerned.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Latvijas Republikas Satversmes tiesa (Constitutional Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the expression \u201cprocessing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures\u201d, used in Article\u00a010 of [the GDPR], be interpreted as meaning that it includes the processing of information relating to penalty points recorded against drivers for motoring offences as provided for in the provision at issue?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Irrespective of the answer to the first question, can the provisions of [the GDPR], in particular the principle of \u201cintegrity and confidentiality\u201d referred to in Article\u00a05(1)(f) thereof, be interpreted as meaning that they prohibit Member States from stipulating that information relating to penalty points recorded against drivers for motoring offences falls within the public domain and from allowing such data to be processed by being communicated?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must recitals\u00a050 and 154, Article\u00a05(1)(b) and Article\u00a010 of [the GDPR] and Article\u00a01(2)(cc) of Directive 2003/98 be interpreted as meaning that they preclude legislation of a Member State which allows information relating to penalty points recorded against drivers for motoring offences to be transmitted for the purposes of re-use?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If any of the foregoing questions is answered in the affirmative, must the principle of the primacy of EU law and the principle of legal certainty be interpreted as meaning that it might be permissible to apply the provision at issue and maintain its legal effects until [the Satversmes tiesa (Constitutional Court) makes a final ruling]?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nFirst\n question\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a010 of the GDPR must be interpreted as applying to the processing of personal data relating to penalty points imposed on drivers of vehicles for road traffic offences, consisting in the public disclosure of such data.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a010 of the GDPR, processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures based on Article\u00a06(1) is to be carried out only under the control of official authority or when the processing is authorised by EU or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should, therefore, first of all be determined whether the information relating to penalty points that is disclosed to third parties pursuant to the legislation at issue in the main proceedings constitutes \u2018personal data\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR, and whether that disclosure constitutes \u2018processing\u2019 of such data, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of that regulation, that comes under its material scope as defined in Article\u00a02.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it is apparent from the order for reference that Latvian legislation provides for the imposition of penalty points on drivers of vehicles who have committed a road traffic offence and upon whom a financial or other penalty has been imposed. Those points are entered by a public body, the CSDD, in the national register of vehicles and their drivers on the day upon which the period for appealing against the decision imposing that penalty expires.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also apparent from the order for reference that road traffic offences and the penalties for punishing them fall within administrative law in Latvia and that the aim of imposing penalty points is not to inflict a further penalty but to heighten awareness of the drivers concerned, by encouraging them to adopt safer driving behaviour. When a certain number of penalty points is reached, the person concerned may be banned from driving for a specified period.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is, in addition, clear from the order for reference that the legislation at issue in the main proceedings obliges the CSDD to disclose information relating to the penalty points imposed on a given driver to any person who requests access to that information. The CSDD merely requires, for that purpose, that the person seeking the information duly identifies the driver concerned by providing his or her national identification number.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must therefore be found that the information relating to penalty points, which concerns an identified natural person, is \u2018personal data\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR, and that its disclosure by the CSDD to third parties constitutes \u2018processing\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, the disclosure of that information falls within the very broad definition, set out in Article\u00a02(1), of the GDPR\u2019s material scope and is not included in the processing of personal data that Article\u00a02(2)(a) and (d) of the GDPR excludes from its material scope.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR provides that that regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data \u2018in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law\u2019. That exception to the applicability of the GDPR must, like the other exceptions laid down in Article\u00a02(2), be interpreted strictly (see, to that effect, judgments of 9\u00a0July 2020, \nLand Hessen\n, C-272/19, EU:C:2020:535, paragraph\u00a068, and of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a084).\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR is to be read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(2)(b) thereof and recital\u00a016, which states that that regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data in the context of \u2018activities which fall outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national security\u2019 and \u2018activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the Union\u2019.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that Article\u00a02(2)(a) and (b) of the GDPR represents partly a continuation of the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46. Therefore, Article\u00a02(2)(a) and (b) of the GDPR cannot be interpreted in broader terms than the exception resulting from the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, a provision which already excluded from that directive\u2019s scope inter alia the processing of personal data taking place in the course \u2018of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles\u00a0V and VI of the [EU Treaty, in the version in force prior to the Treaty of Lisbon,] and in any case\u00a0\u2026 processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security\u00a0\u2026\u2019.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has repeatedly held, only the processing of personal data in the course of an activity of the State or of State authorities which was expressly listed in Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 or in the course of an activity which could be classified in the same category was excluded from the scope of that directive (see, to that effect, judgments of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraphs\u00a042 to 44; of 27\u00a0September 2017, \nPu\u0161k\u00e1r\n, C-73/16, EU:C:2017:725, paragraphs\u00a036 and 37; and of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a038).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital\u00a016 thereof, must be regarded as being designed solely to exclude from the scope of that regulation the processing of personal data carried out by State authorities in the course of an activity which is intended to safeguard national security or of an activity which can be classified in the same category, with the result that the mere fact that an activity is an activity characteristic of the State or of a public authority is not sufficient ground for that exception to be automatically applicable to such an activity (see, to that effect, judgment of 9\u00a0July 2020, \nLand Hessen\n, C-272/19, EU:C:2020:535, paragraph\u00a070).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The activities having the aim of safeguarding national security that are envisaged in Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR encompass, in particular, as the Advocate General has also observed in essence in points\u00a057 and 58 of his Opinion, those that are intended to protect essential State functions and the fundamental interests of society.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, activities relating to road safety do not pursue such an objective and consequently cannot be classified in the category of activities having the aim of safeguarding national security, which are envisaged in Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Article\u00a02(2)(d) of the GDPR provides that that regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data \u2018by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security\u2019. As is clear from recital\u00a019 of the GDPR, the reason for that exception is that the processing of personal data for such purposes by the competent authorities is governed by a more specific EU legal act, namely Directive 2016/680, which was adopted on the same day as the GDPR. Directive 2016/680 defines \u2018competent authority\u2019 in Article\u00a03(7) and such a definition must be applied, by analogy, to Article\u00a02(2)(d) of the GDPR.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from recital\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 that the concept of \u2018competent authority\u2019 must be understood in relation to the protection of personal data in the fields of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation, in view of the arrangements which may prove necessary, in that regard, because of the specific nature of those fields. In addition, recital\u00a011 of that directive explains that the GDPR applies to processing of personal data that is carried out by a \u2018competent authority\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(7) of the directive, but for purposes other than those of the directive.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the material available to the Court, it does not appear that, in carrying out the activities at issue in the main proceedings, which consist in disclosing to the public, for a road safety purpose, personal data relating to penalty points, the CSDD may be regarded as a \u2018competent authority\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(7) of Directive 2016/680, and, therefore, that such activities may be covered by the exception laid down in Article\u00a02(2) of the GDPR.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the disclosure by the CSDD of the personal data relating to penalty points imposed on drivers of vehicles for road traffic offences falls within the material scope of the GDPR.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the applicability of Article\u00a010 of the GDPR to such disclosure, the question is whether the information thereby disclosed constitutes personal data \u2018relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, the processing of which \u2018shall be carried out only under the control of official authority\u2019, unless the processing is \u2018authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects\u2019.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is to be noted that Article\u00a010 of the GDPR is intended to ensure enhanced protection as regards processing which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data at issue, is liable to constitute a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and\u00a08 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a044).\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the data to which Article\u00a010 of the GDPR refers relates to behaviour that gives rise to social disapproval, the grant of access to such data is liable to stigmatise the data subject and thereby to constitute a serious interference with his or her private or professional life.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, it is true that decisions of the Latvian authorities for the purpose of punishment of road traffic offences are, as the Latvian Government has stated in its replies to the Court\u2019s questions, entered in the register of convictions, to which the public has access only in limited circumstances, and not in the register of vehicles and their drivers, to which Article\u00a0141(2) of the Law on road traffic gives free access. However, as the referring court pointed out, disclosure by the CSDD of personal data entered in the latter register that relate to penalty points enables the public to ascertain whether a given person has committed road traffic offences and, if so, to deduce the seriousness and frequency of those offences. Such a system for the disclosure of penalty points therefore effectively gives access to personal data relating to road traffic offences.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to determine whether such access amounts to processing of personal data relating to \u2018offences\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a010 of the GDPR, it must be pointed out, first, that that term refers exclusively to criminal offences, as is apparent inter alia from the history of the GDPR. Whilst the European Parliament had proposed the express inclusion in that provision of the words \u2018administrative sanctions\u2019 (OJ 2017 C\u00a0378, p.\u00a0430), that proposal was not adopted. That fact is all the more noteworthy because the provision that preceded Article\u00a010 of the GDPR, namely Article\u00a08(5) of Directive 95/46, which referred, in its first subparagraph, to \u2018offences\u2019 and \u2018criminal convictions\u2019, enabled the Member States, in its second subparagraph, to \u2018provide that data relating to administrative sanctions\u00a0\u2026 also be processed under the control of official authority\u2019. It is thus clear from reading Article\u00a08(5) as a whole that the term \u2018offence\u2019 referred only to criminal offences.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it must be held that, in deliberately not including the adjective \u2018administrative\u2019 in Article\u00a010 of the GDPR, the EU legislature intended to limit the enhanced protection provided for by that provision to the criminal field alone.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General has observed in points\u00a074 to 77 of his Opinion, that interpretation is borne out by the fact that a number of language versions of Article\u00a010 of the GDPR make express reference to \u2018criminal offences\u2019, for example the versions in German (\nStraftaten\n), Spanish (\ninfracciones penales\n), Italian (\nreati\n), Lithuanian (\nnusikalstamas veikas\n), Maltese (\nreati\n) and Dutch (\nstrafbare feiten\n).\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the fact that road traffic offences are classified as administrative in Latvia is not decisive when determining whether those offences are covered by Article\u00a010 of the GDPR.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be pointed out that the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union (judgments of 19\u00a0September 2000, \nLinster\n, C-287/98, EU:C:2000:468, paragraph\u00a043, and of 1\u00a0October 2019, \nPlanet49\n, C-673/17, EU:C:2019:801, paragraph\u00a047).\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, it is to be noted, first of all, that the GDPR does not contain any reference to national law so far as concerns the scope of the terms in Article\u00a010 thereof, in particular the terms \u2018offences\u2019 and \u2018criminal convictions\u2019.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, it is apparent from recital\u00a010 of the GDPR that that regulation is intended to contribute to the accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice by ensuring a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, which requires the level of protection to be equivalent and homogeneous in all the Member States. It would be contrary to such an objective if the enhanced protection provided for in Article\u00a010 of the GDPR applied to the processing of personal data relating to road traffic offences only in some Member States, and not in others, solely because those offences are not classified as criminal in the latter Member States.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, as the Advocate General has observed in point\u00a084 of his Opinion, that finding is supported by recital\u00a013 of Directive 2016/680 which states that \u2018a criminal offence within the meaning of this Directive should be an autonomous concept of Union law as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union\u2019.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the concept of \u2018criminal offence\u2019, which is decisive for determining whether Article\u00a010 of the GDPR is applicable to personal data relating to road traffic offences, such as the data at issue in the main proceedings, requires an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union, having regard to the objective pursued by that provision and the context of which it forms part; the classification given by the Member State concerned to those offences is not conclusive in that regard as the classification may vary from one country to another (see, to that effect, judgment of 14\u00a0November 2013, \nBal\u00e1\u017e\n, C-60/12, EU:C:2013:733, paragraphs\u00a026 and 35).\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, it must be examined whether road traffic offences, such as those which give rise to entry in the register of vehicles and their drivers of the penalty points whose disclosure to third parties is provided for by the provision at issue, constitute a \u2018criminal offence\u2019, for the purposes of Article\u00a010 of the GDPR.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Court\u2019s case-law, three criteria are relevant for assessing whether an offence is criminal in nature. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the intrinsic nature of the offence, and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned is liable to incur (see, to that effect, judgments of 5\u00a0June 2012, \nBonda\n, C-489/10, EU:C:2012:319, paragraph\u00a037; of 20\u00a0March 2018, \nGarlsson Real Estate and Others\n, C-537/16, EU:C:2018:193, paragraph\u00a028; and of 2\u00a0February 2021, \nConsob\n, C-481/19, EU:C:2021:84, paragraph\u00a042).\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even in the case of offences which are not classified as \u2018criminal\u2019 by national law, the intrinsic nature of the offence in question and the degree of severity of the penalties to which it is liable to give rise may nevertheless result in its being criminal in nature (see, to that effect, judgment of 20\u00a0March 2018, \nGarlsson Real Estate and Others\n, C-537/16, EU:C:2018:193, paragraphs\u00a028 and 32).\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the criterion relating to the intrinsic nature of the offence, it must be ascertained whether the penalty at issue has a punitive purpose and the mere fact that it also pursues a deterrent purpose does not mean that it cannot be characterised as a criminal penalty. It is of the very nature of criminal penalties that they seek both to punish and to deter unlawful conduct. By contrast, a measure which merely repairs the damage caused by the offence at issue is not criminal in nature (see, to that effect, judgments of 5\u00a0June 2012, \nBonda\n, C-489/10, EU:C:2012:319, paragraph\u00a039, and of 20\u00a0March 2018, \nGarlsson Real Estate \nand Others\n, C-537/16, EU:C:2018:193, paragraph\u00a033). It is not in dispute that the giving of penalty points for road traffic offences, and also the fines or other penalties to which the commission of those offences may give rise, are not intended only to repair any harm caused by those offences but also have a punitive purpose.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns the criterion relating to the degree of severity of the penalties to which the commission of those offences may give rise, it is to be noted, first of all, that only road traffic offences of a certain seriousness entail the giving of penalty points and that such offences are therefore liable to give rise to penalties of a certain severity. Next, the imposition of penalty points is generally additional to the penalty for the commission of such an offence, which, as has been noted in paragraph\u00a058 above, is indeed true of the legislation at issue in the main proceedings. Finally, the accumulation of penalty points itself has legal consequences, such as the obligation to sit a test, or even a driving ban.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This analysis is borne out by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights according to which, notwithstanding the move towards \u2018decriminalisation\u2019 of road traffic offences in certain States, those offences must generally, in the light of the purpose, both deterrent and punitive, of the penalties imposed and the degree of severity that those penalties may have, be regarded as being criminal in nature (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 21\u00a0February 1984, \n\u00d6zt\u00fcrk \nv. \nGermany\n, CE:ECHR:1984:0221JUD000854479, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049 to 53; 29\u00a0June 2007, \nO\u2019Halloran and Francis \nv. \nthe \nUnited Kingdom\n, CE:ECHR:2007:0629JUD001580902, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a033 to 36; and 4\u00a0October 2016, \nRivard \nv. \nSwitzerland\n, CE:ECHR:2016:1004JUD002156312, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a023 and 24).\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The classification of road traffic offences which may result in the giving of penalty points as a \u2018criminal offence\u2019, for the purposes of Article\u00a010 of the GDPR, is also consonant with the aim of that provision. The public disclosure of personal data relating to road traffic offences, including the penalty points imposed for committing them, is liable, in light of the fact that such offences compromise road safety, to give rise to social disapproval and to result in stigmatisation of the data subject, in particular where the penalty points reveal a certain seriousness or certain frequency of the offences.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that road traffic offences which may result in penalty points being given are covered by the term \u2018offences\u2019 in Article\u00a010 of the GDPR.\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question referred is that Article\u00a010 of the GDPR must be interpreted as applying to the processing of personal data relating to penalty points imposed on drivers of vehicles for road traffic offences.\n\u00a0\nS\necond\n question\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the provisions of the GDPR must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which obliges the public body responsible for the register in which penalty points imposed on drivers of vehicles for road traffic offences are entered to disclose those data to any person who requests them, without that person having to establish a specific interest in obtaining the data.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All processing of personal data must comply, first, with the principles relating to processing of data set out in Article\u00a05 of the GDPR and, second, with one of the principles relating to lawfulness of processing listed in Article\u00a06 of that regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0January 2019, \nDeutsche Post\n, C-496/17, EU:C:2019:26, paragraph\u00a057 and the case-law cited).\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the principles relating to processing of personal data, it is true that the referring court makes specific reference to the principles of \u2018integrity\u2019 and \u2018confidentiality\u2019 laid down in Article\u00a05(1)(f) of the GDPR. Nevertheless, it is apparent from the doubts expressed by that court that it seeks to establish more generally whether the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings may be regarded as lawful in the light of all of the provisions of that regulation and, in particular, in the light of the principle of proportionality.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that account should also be taken, in the answer to be provided to the referring court, of the other principles set out in Article\u00a05(1) of the GDPR, in particular of the principle of \u2018data minimisation\u2019 in Article\u00a05(1)(c), according to which personal data are to be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed, and which gives expression to the principle of proportionality (see, to that effect, judgment of 11\u00a0December 2019, \nAsocia\u0163ia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA\n, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraph\u00a048).\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns the principles relating to lawfulness of processing, Article\u00a06 of the GDPR sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of the cases in which processing of personal data can be regarded as lawful. Thus, in order to be capable of being considered lawful, processing must fall within one of the cases provided for in Article\u00a06 (see, to that effect, judgment of 11\u00a0December 2019, \nAsocia\u0163ia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA\n, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraphs\u00a037 and 38). The processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings\u00a0\u2013 namely the public disclosure of data relating to penalty points imposed for road traffic offences\u00a0\u2013 carried out by the CSDD may fall within Article\u00a06(1)(e) of the GDPR, under which processing is lawful if and to the extent that it is \u2018necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller\u2019.\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, since, as has been held in paragraph\u00a094 above, personal data relating to penalty points imposed on drivers of vehicles for road traffic offences are covered by Article\u00a010 of the GDPR, their processing is subject to the additional restrictions laid down in that provision. Thus, under that provision, processing of those data \u2018shall be carried out only under the control of official authority\u2019, unless it is \u2018authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects\u2019. Article\u00a010 states, in addition, that \u2018any comprehensive register of criminal convictions shall be kept only under the control of official authority\u2019.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, it is not in dispute that the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings, namely the public disclosure of data relating to penalty points imposed for road traffic offences, is carried out by a public body, the CSDD, which is the controller within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR (see, by analogy, judgment of 9\u00a0March 2017, \nManni\n, C-398/15, EU:C:2017:197, paragraph\u00a035). However, it is also not in dispute that, once the data have been disclosed, they are consulted by the persons who requested their disclosure and, as the case may be, are stored or disseminated by those persons. Since that further data processing is no longer carried out \u2018under the control\u2019 of the CSDD or other official authority, the national law authorising disclosure of the data by the CSDD must provide for \u2018appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects\u2019.\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it is in the light both of the general rules governing lawfulness, in particular those laid down in Article\u00a05(1)(c) and Article\u00a06(1)(e) of the GDPR, and of the specific restrictions prescribed in Article\u00a010 thereof that it should be examined whether national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings is consistent with that regulation.\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is to be noted that none of those provisions lays down a general and absolute prohibition preventing a public authority from being empowered, or indeed compelled, under national legislation to disclose personal data to persons requesting such data.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whilst Article\u00a05(1)(c) of the GDPR requires the principle of \u2018data minimisation\u2019 to be observed when personal data are processed, it is clear from the wording of that provision that it is not intended to impose a general and absolute prohibition of that kind and that, in particular, it does not preclude personal data from being disclosed to the public where such disclosure is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(e) of that regulation. That is so even where the data in question are covered by Article\u00a010 of the GDPR, provided that the legislation authorising the disclosure provides for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a073).\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should be borne in mind that the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society and be weighed against other fundamental rights. Limitations may therefore be imposed, so long as, in accordance with Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, they are provided for by law, respect the essence of the fundamental rights and observe the principle of proportionality. Under the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others. They must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary and the legislation which entails the interference must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraphs\u00a0172 to 176).\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in order to determine whether public disclosure of personal data relating to penalty points, such as the disclosure at issue in the main proceedings, is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(e) of the GDPR, and whether the legislation authorising such disclosure provides for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects, within the meaning of Article\u00a010 of that regulation, it should be ascertained in particular whether, having regard to the seriousness of the interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data caused by that disclosure, the latter is justified, and in particular proportionate, for the purpose of achieving the objectives pursued.\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, the Latvian Parliament, in its observations before the referring court, and the Latvian Government, in its observations before the Court of Justice, contend that the disclosure by the CSDD of personal data relating to penalty points to any person who so requests falls within the task in the public interest, entrusted to that body, of improving road safety and is intended, in that respect, in particular to enable identification of drivers of vehicles who systematically infringe the road traffic rules and to influence the conduct of road users by encouraging them to behave in accordance with those rules.\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The improvement of road safety is an objective of general interest recognised by the European Union (see, to that effect, judgment of 23\u00a0April 2015, \nAykul\n, C-260/13, EU:C:2015:257, paragraph\u00a069 and the case-law cited). Member States are therefore justified in classifying road safety as a \u2018task carried out in the public interest\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(e) of the GDPR.\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in order to satisfy the conditions imposed by that provision, it is necessary that the disclosure of personal data relating to penalty points entered in the register kept by the CSDD genuinely meets the objective of general interest of improving road safety, without going beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As recital\u00a039 of the GDPR makes clear, that requirement of necessity is not met where the objective of general interest pursued can reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights of data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and\u00a08 of the Charter, since derogations and limitations in relation to the principle of protection of such data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (see, to that effect, judgment of 11\u00a0December 2019, \nAsocia\u0163ia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA\n, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraphs\u00a046 and 47).\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is clear from the practice of the Member States, each of them has a large number of methods, including that of deterrent punishment of road traffic offences, in particular by depriving the drivers concerned of the right to drive a vehicle, a ban whose breach may in turn be punished by effective sentences, without the public disclosure of the adoption of such measures being necessary. It is also clear from the Member States\u2019 practice that numerous preventive measures may, furthermore, be adopted, ranging from public awareness campaigns to the adoption of individual measures requiring a driver to undergo training and take tests, without the public disclosure of the adoption of such individual measures being necessary. However, it is not apparent from the documents before the Court that such measures had been examined and preferred by the Latvian legislature instead of the adoption of the rules at issue in the main proceedings.\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as has been pointed out in paragraph\u00a092 above, the public disclosure of personal data relating to road traffic offences, including data relating to the penalty points imposed for committing them, is liable to constitute a serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, since it may give rise to social disapproval and result in stigmatisation of the data subject.\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light, first, of the sensitivity of the data in question and the seriousness of that interference with the fundamental rights of data subjects to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data and, second, of the fact that, having regard to the findings in paragraph\u00a0111 above, it is not apparent that the objective of improving road safety cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other less restrictive means, the necessity, in order to achieve that objective, of such a system of disclosure of personal data relating to penalty points imposed for road traffic offences cannot be regarded as established (see, by analogy, judgment of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraph\u00a086).\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, whilst it may be justified to distinguish drivers who disregard the road traffic rules systematically and in bad faith from drivers who commit offences occasionally, the view cannot, however, be taken that identification of the first category of drivers must, for the purpose of improving road safety, be carried out by or shared with the general public, with the result that it is even questionable whether the legislation at issue in the main proceedings is appropriate for achieving the first of the objectives referred to in paragraph\u00a0107 above.\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that the CSDD discloses to the public not only the data relating to penalty points imposed on drivers disregarding the road traffic rules systematically and in bad faith, but also the data relating to penalty points imposed on drivers committing offences occasionally. It is thus clear that, in providing for general public access to penalty points, the legislation at issue in the main proceedings in any event goes beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objective of combatting the systematic disregard in bad faith of the road traffic rules.\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns the second objective mentioned in paragraph\u00a0107 above pursued by the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that, whilst a downward trend in the number of road traffic accidents may have been observed in Latvia, there is no basis for concluding that that trend is connected with disclosure of the information relating to penalty points rather than to the establishment of the penalty points system in itself.\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The conclusion set out in paragraph\u00a0113 above is not invalidated by the fact that in practice the CSDD makes disclosure of the personal data at issue conditional on applicants stating the national identification number of the driver about whom they wish to enquire.\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if, as the Latvian Government has stated, the disclosure of national identification numbers by the public bodies keeping the population registers is subject to strict requirements and thus complies with Article\u00a087 of the GDPR, the fact remains that the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, as applied by the CSDD, permits any person who knows the national identification number of a particular driver to obtain, without any further condition, the personal data relating to the penalty points that have been imposed on that driver. Such a disclosure regime is liable to lead to a situation in which those data are disclosed to persons who, for reasons unrelated to the objective of general interest of improving road safety, wish to find out about the penalty points that have been imposed on a given person.\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is the conclusion set out in paragraph\u00a0113 above invalidated by the fact that the national register of vehicles and their drivers is an official document, within the meaning of Article\u00a086 of the GDPR.\n120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whilst, as follows from recital\u00a0154 of the GDPR, public access to official documents constitutes a public interest capable of justifying the disclosure of personal data contained in such documents, that access must nevertheless be reconciled with the fundamental rights to respect for private live and to the protection of personal data, as Article\u00a086 indeed expressly requires. In the light in particular of the sensitivity of data relating to penalty points imposed for road traffic offences and of the seriousness of the interference with the fundamental rights of data subjects to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, which is caused by the disclosure of such data, it must be held that those rights prevail over the public\u2019s interest in having access to official documents, in particular the national register of vehicles and their drivers.\n121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, for the same reason, the right to freedom of information referred to in Article\u00a085 of the GDPR cannot be interpreted as justifying the disclosure to any person who so requests of personal data relating to penalty points imposed for road traffic offences.\n122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the second question is that the provisions of the GDPR, in particular Article\u00a05(1), Article\u00a06(1)(e) and Article\u00a010 thereof, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which obliges the public body responsible for the register in which penalty points imposed on drivers of vehicles for road traffic offences are entered to make those data accessible to the public, without the person requesting access having to establish a specific interest in obtaining the data.\n\u00a0\nThird\n question\n123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the provisions of the GDPR, in particular Article\u00a05(1)(b) and Article\u00a010 thereof, and Article\u00a01(2)(cc) of Directive 2003/98 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which authorises the public body responsible for the register in which penalty points imposed on drivers of vehicles for road traffic offences are entered to disclose those data to economic operators for re-use.\n124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the referring court states, this question arises from the fact that the CSDD concludes contracts with economic operators pursuant to which it transmits to them the personal data relating to penalty points entered in the national register of vehicles and their drivers, in order, inter alia, to enable any person wishing to find out about the penalty points imposed on a particular driver to obtain such data not only from the CSDD but also from those economic operators.\n125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from the answer to the second question that the provisions of the GDPR, in particular Article\u00a05(1), Article\u00a06(1)(e) and Article\u00a010 thereof, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which obliges the public body responsible for the register in which penalty points imposed on drivers of vehicles for road traffic offences are entered to make those data accessible to the public, without the person requesting access having to establish a specific interest in obtaining the data.\n126\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those provisions must, for reasons identical to those set out in the answer to the second question, be interpreted as also precluding national legislation which authorises a public body to disclose data of that kind to economic operators in order for the data to be re-used and disclosed to the public by them.\n127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, so far as concerns Article\u00a01(2)(cc) of Directive 2003/98, to which the third question also refers, as the Advocate General has observed in points\u00a0128 and 129 of his Opinion that provision is not relevant for the purpose of determining whether the rules of EU law on the protection of personal data preclude legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings.\n128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Irrespective of whether data relating to penalty points imposed on drivers for road traffic offences are covered by Directive 2003/98, the scope of the protection of those data must, in any event, be determined on the basis of the GDPR, as follows, first, from recital\u00a0154 of the GDPR and, second, from recital\u00a021 and Article\u00a01(4) of that directive, both read in conjunction with Article\u00a094(2) of the GDPR. Article\u00a01(4) of Directive 2003/98 provides, in essence, that that directive leaves intact and in no way affects the level of protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data inter alia under EU law, and in particular does not alter the obligations and rights set out in the GDPR.\n129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the third question is that the provisions of the GDPR, in particular Article\u00a05(1), Article\u00a06(1)(e) and Article\u00a010 thereof, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which authorises the public body responsible for the register in which penalty points imposed on drivers of vehicles for road traffic offences are entered to disclose those data to economic operators for re-use.\n\u00a0\nFourth \nquestion\n130\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the principle of primacy of EU law must be interpreted as precluding the constitutional court of a Member State, before which a complaint has been brought challenging national legislation that proves, in the light of a preliminary ruling given by the Court of Justice, to be incompatible with EU law, from deciding, in accordance with the principle of legal certainty, that the legal effects of that legislation be maintained until the date of delivery of the judgment by which it rules finally on that constitutional complaint.\n131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from the order for reference, this question has been referred on account of the large number of legal relationships affected by the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings and of the fact that, under Article\u00a032(3) of the Law on the Constitutional Court and the case-law relating thereto, the referring court, in performing its task of ensuring a balance between the principle of legal certainty and the fundamental rights of the persons concerned, may limit the retroactive effect of its judgments in order to prevent them from seriously compromising the rights of others.\n132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that the interpretation which, in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on it by Article\u00a0267 TFEU, the Court gives to rules of EU law clarifies and defines the meaning and scope of those rules as they must be or ought to have been understood and applied from the time of their entry into force. It is only exceptionally that the Court may, in application of the general principle of legal certainty inherent in the EU legal order, be moved to restrict for any person concerned the opportunity of relying on a provision which it has interpreted with a view to calling into question legal relationships established in good faith. Two essential criteria must be fulfilled before such a limitation can be imposed, namely that those concerned should have acted in good faith and that there should be a risk of serious difficulties (judgments of 6\u00a0March 2007, \nMeilicke\n, C-292/04, EU:C:2007:132, paragraphs\u00a034 and 35; of 22\u00a0January 2015, \nBalazs\n, C-401/13 and C-432/13, EU:C:2015:26, paragraphs\u00a049 and 50; and of 29\u00a0September 2015, \nGmina Wroc\u0142aw\n, C-276/14, EU:C:2015:635, paragraphs\u00a044 and 45).\n133\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has consistently held, such a restriction may be allowed only in the actual judgment ruling upon the interpretation sought. Indeed, there must necessarily be a single occasion when a decision is made on the temporal effects of the requested interpretation which the Court gives of a provision of EU law. The principle that a restriction may be allowed only in the actual judgment ruling upon that interpretation guarantees the equal treatment of the Member States and of other persons subject to EU law, under that law, and fulfils, at the same time, the requirements arising from the principle of legal certainty (judgment of 6\u00a0March 2007, \nMeilicke\n, C-292/04, EU:C:2007:132, paragraphs\u00a036 and 37; see, to that effect, judgments of 23\u00a0October 2012, \nNelson and Others\n, C-581/10 and C-629/10, EU:C:2012:657, paragraph\u00a091, and of 7\u00a0November 2018, \nO\u2019Brien\n, C-432/17, EU:C:2018:879, paragraph\u00a034).\n134\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the temporal effects of a preliminary ruling given by the Court cannot depend on the date of delivery of the judgment by which the referring court rules finally on the main action, or even on the referring court\u2019s assessment of the need to preserve the legal effects of the national legislation at issue.\n135\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By virtue of the principle of primacy of EU law, rules of national law, even of a constitutional order, cannot be allowed to undermine the unity and effectiveness of EU law (see, to that effect, judgments of 26\u00a0February 2013, \nMelloni\n, C-399/11, EU:C:2013:107, paragraph\u00a059, and of 29\u00a0July 2019, \nPelham and Others\n, C-476/17, EU:C:2019:624, paragraph\u00a078). Even assuming that overriding considerations of legal certainty are capable of leading, by way of exception, to a provisional suspension of the ousting effect which a directly applicable rule of EU law has on national law that is contrary thereto, the conditions of such a suspension can be determined solely by the Court (see, to that effect, judgment of 8\u00a0September 2010, \nWinner Wetten\n, C-409/06, EU:C:2010:503, paragraphs\u00a061 and 67).\n136\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this instance, since a risk of serious difficulties resulting from the interpretation adopted by the Court in the present judgment has not been shown to exist and the criteria referred to in paragraph\u00a0132 above are cumulative, it is not appropriate to limit the judgment\u2019s temporal effects.\n137\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the fourth question is that the principle of primacy of EU law must be interpreted as precluding the constitutional court of a Member State, before which a complaint has been brought challenging national legislation that proves, in the light of a preliminary ruling given by the Court of Justice, to be incompatible with EU law, from deciding, in accordance with the principle of legal certainty, that the legal effects of that legislation be maintained until the date of delivery of the judgment by which it rules finally on that constitutional complaint.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n138\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a010 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive\u00a095/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), must be interpreted as applying to the processing of personal data relating to penalty points imposed on drivers of vehicles for road traffic offences.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular Article\u00a05(1), Article\u00a06(1)(e) and Article\u00a010 thereof, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which obliges the public body responsible for the register in which penalty points imposed on drivers of vehicles for road traffic offences are entered to make those data accessible to the public, without the person requesting access having to establish a specific interest in obtaining the data.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular Article\u00a05(1), Article\u00a06(1)(e) and Article\u00a010 thereof, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which authorises the public body responsible for the register in which penalty points imposed on drivers of vehicles for road traffic offences are entered to disclose those data to economic operators for re-use.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe principle of primacy of EU law must be interpreted as precluding the constitutional court of a Member State, before which a complaint has been brought challenging national legislation that proves, in the light of a preliminary ruling given by the Court of Justice, to be incompatible with EU law, from deciding, in accordance with the principle of legal certainty, that the legal effects of that legislation be maintained until the date of delivery of the judgment by which it rules finally on that constitutional complaint."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 1 Aug 2022, C-184/20 (\nVyriausioji tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija\n)\nGeneral

stated:\n\u2018(10)\u00a0\u2026 the object of the national laws on the processing of personal data is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, which is recognised both in Article\u00a08 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in the general principles of Community law;\u00a0\u2026 for that reason, the approximation of those laws must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community;\n\u2026\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 in order to be lawful, the processing of personal data must in addition be carried out with the consent of the data subject or be necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract binding on the data subject, or as a legal requirement, or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, or in the legitimate interests of a natural or legal person, provided that the interests or the rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding;\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 data which are capable by their nature of infringing fundamental freedoms or privacy should not be processed unless the

Article\u00a094(1) thereof, the GDPR repealed Directive 95/46 with effect from 25\u00a0May 2018. By virtue of Article\u00a099(2), the GDPR applies from that date.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a04, 10, 26, 35, 39 and 51 of the GDPR state:\n\u2018(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the [Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Charter)] as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.\n\u2026\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States.\u00a0\u2026 Regarding the processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation.\u00a0\u2026 This Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the processing of special categories of personal data (\u201csensitive data\u201d). To that extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.\n\u2026\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person.\u00a0\u2026 To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which reveal information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms.\u00a0\u2026 Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing is allowed in specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account that Member States law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general principles and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the conditions for lawful processing. Derogations from the general prohibition for processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided, inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\u2019\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01 of the GDPR, headed \u2018Subject matter and objectives\u2019, provides in paragraph\u00a02:\n\u2018This

He states that, in his capacity as director of QP, he is vested with no powers of public administration and does not provide any public service to the population. Furthermore, QP, as a non-governmental organisation, carries out its activity independently of the public authorities.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, and in any event, even if he is required to lodge a declaration of private interests, OT contends that its publication would adversely affect both his right to respect for private life and that of the other persons whom he would, as the case may be, be required to mention in his declaration.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Chief Ethics Commission asserts that, in so far as OT was vested with administrative powers in an establishment in receipt of financing from EU structural funds and the budget of the Lithuanian State, he was required to lodge a declaration of private interests, despite his not being an official and even if he did not exercise any powers of public administration. In addition, the Chief Ethics Commission observes that, whilst publication of such a declaration is liable to constitute an interference in the private life of OT and his spouse, that interference is provided for by the Law on the reconciliation of interests.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court has doubts as to whether the regime laid down by the Law on the reconciliation of interests is compatible with points (c) and (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a06(3) of the GDPR and with Article\u00a09(1) thereof. It takes the view that the personal data contained in a declaration of private interests are liable to reveal information on the private life of the declarant and his or her spouse and of the declarant\u2019s children, with the result that their disclosure is capable of infringing the right of the data subjects to respect for their private life. Indeed, those data are liable to reveal particularly sensitive information, such as the fact that the data subject is cohabiting or is living with another person of the same sex, the disclosure of which might well result in significant nuisance in the private life of those persons. The data concerning presents received and transactions carried out, by the declarant and his or her spouse, cohabitee or partner, also reveal certain details of their private life. Moreover, the data concerning close relatives or acquaintances of the declarant who may give rise to a conflict of interests reveal information about the declarant\u2019s family and personal relationships.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, whilst the Law on the reconciliation of interests has the objective of ensuring that the principle of transparency is observed when public functions are performed, in particular when decisions concerning implementation of the public interest are adopted, publication on the internet of matters capable of affecting the adoption of such decisions is not necessary in order to achieve that objective. Communication of the personal data to the bodies envisaged in Article\u00a05 of that law and the monitoring task that is assigned to the organs referred to in Article\u00a022 thereof constitute measures sufficient to ensure that that objective is achieved.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Vilniaus apygardos administracinis teismas (Regional Administrative Court, Vilnius, Lithuania) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the condition laid down in [point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1)] of the [GDPR] that processing [of the personal data] is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, with regard to the requirements laid down in Article\u00a06(3) of [that regulation], including the requirement that the Member State law must meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, and also with regard to Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, be interpreted as meaning that national law may not require the disclosure of declarations of private interests and their publication on the website of the controller (the [Chief Ethics Commission]), thereby providing access to those data to all individuals who have access to the internet?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the prohibition of the processing of special categories of personal data established in Article\u00a09(1) of the [GDPR], regard being had to the conditions established in Article\u00a09(2) of [that regulation], including the condition established in point (g) thereof that processing [of the personal data] must be necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of EU or Member State law which must be proportionate to the aim pursued, must respect the essence of the right to data protection and must provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject, be interpreted, also with regard to Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, as meaning that national law may not require the disclosure of data relating to declarations of private interests which may disclose personal data, including data which make it possible to determine a person\u2019s political views, trade union membership, sexual orientation and other personal information, and their publication on the website of the controller (the [Chief Ethics Commission]), providing access to those data to all individuals who have access to the internet?\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe admissibility of the request for a preliminary ruling\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Lithuanian Government and the European Commission have stated that, following the amendment of the Law on the reconciliation of interests, which entered into force on 1\u00a0January 2020, the applicant in the main proceedings is no longer a person to whom that law applies.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Commission observes that, in a judgment of 20\u00a0September 2018, the Lietuvos Respublikos Konstitucinis Teismas (Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania), which the referring court had requested to assess the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Law on the reconciliation of interests, found that Article\u00a010 thereof, which requires the data relating to private interests to be published, was not at issue in the main proceedings.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that, in accordance with settled case-law, the procedure provided for in Article\u00a0267 TFEU is an instrument of cooperation between the Court of Justice and the national courts, by means of which the Court provides the national courts with the points of interpretation of EU law which they need in order to decide the disputes before them (judgment of 12\u00a0March 1998, \nDjabali\n, C-314/96, EU:C:1998:104, paragraph\u00a017, and order of 3\u00a0December 2020, \nFedasil\n, C-67/20 to C-69/20, not published, EU:C:2020:1024, paragraph\u00a018).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with equally settled case-law, questions on the interpretation of EU law referred by a national court in the factual and legislative context which that court is responsible for defining, and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court to determine, enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 22\u00a0February 2022, \nStichting Rookpreventie Jeugd and Others\n, C-160/20, EU:C:2022:101, paragraph\u00a082 and the case-law cited).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, it must be pointed out that, in response to a request by the Court for information, the referring court explained, first, that the legality of the decision at issue in the main proceedings has to be assessed in the light of the national provisions in force on the date of that decision\u2019s adoption. The Law on the reconciliation of interests included amongst the persons who had to lodge a declaration of private interests those who work in public associations or establishments that receive finance from the budget or from funds of the State or of a local authority and who are vested with administrative powers.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court stated, furthermore, that although the applicant in the main proceedings can no longer be equated to a person working in the public service, within the meaning of the Law on the reconciliation of interests as amended, he is nevertheless capable of falling within the category of persons that is referred to in Article\u00a04(3)(8) of that law and that, on that basis, he may be required to lodge a declaration of private interests.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the referring court stated that the main proceedings are not affected by the judgment of the Lietuvos Respublikos Konstitucinis Teismas (Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania) of 20\u00a0September 2018, by which it declared that the referring court\u2019s request that it rule on whether Article\u00a010(1) and (2) of the Law on the reconciliation of interests is consistent with the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania and the constitutional principle of proportionality was inadmissible on the ground that the question to be decided in the main proceedings relates not to the public disclosure of the data provided in declarations of private interests, but to the obligation to lodge such a declaration.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court explained that, even though the question to be decided in the main proceedings is indeed, as the Lietuvos Respublikos Konstitucinis Teismas (Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania) stated, whether the applicant in the main proceedings infringed Article\u00a03(2) and Article\u00a04(1) of the Law on the reconciliation of interests because he failed to comply with the obligation to lodge a declaration of private interests, in order to review the legality of the decision at issue in the main proceedings it is necessary to take account of the mandatory consequences, resulting from the application of Article\u00a010 of that law, of the lodging of such a declaration, namely the publication on the Chief Ethics Commission\u2019s website of certain data contained in the declaration, since the applicant in the main proceedings pleads in support of his action for annulment of that decision that that publication is unlawful.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the information thereby provided by the referring court, the matters put forward by the Lithuanian Government and the Commission are not sufficient to rebut the presumption of relevance enjoyed by the questions referred and it cannot be considered to be quite obvious that the interpretation of provisions of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, or that the problem is hypothetical, as the referring court may take account of that interpretation for the purpose of adopting its decision. Furthermore, the Court has before it the factual and legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore the request for a preliminary ruling is admissible.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe \napplicable\n law \n\u00a0\nratione temporis\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its questions, the referring court requests interpretation of the GDPR. In accordance with Article\u00a099(2) thereof, the GDPR became applicable on 25\u00a0May 2018, the date with effect from which, by virtue of Article\u00a094(1), it repealed Directive 95/46.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the decision at issue in the main proceedings, which was adopted by the Chief Ethics Commission on 7\u00a0February 2018, was governed by Directive 95/46.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that, by that decision, the Chief Ethics Commission alleged that the applicant in the main proceedings had failed to lodge a declaration of private interests, in breach of the Law on the reconciliation of interests. That being so, in the light of the information referred to in paragraph\u00a050 of the present judgment and in the absence of anything to indicate that the applicant in the main proceedings lodged such a declaration before 25\u00a0May 2018, that is to say, the date on which the GDPR became applicable, the possibility remains that that regulation is applicable \nratione temporis \n to the dispute in the main proceedings, a matter which is for the referring court to determine.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, there is no need to distinguish between the provisions of Directive 95/46 and those of the GDPR referred to in the two questions referred for a preliminary ruling, as reformulated, since the purport of those provisions must be regarded as similar for the purposes of the interpretation that the Court is required to give in the present case (see, by analogy, judgment of 21\u00a0November 2013, \nDixons Retail\n, C-494/12, EU:C:2013:758, paragraph\u00a018).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in order to provide useful answers to the questions submitted by the referring court, they should be examined on the basis of both Directive 95/46 and the GDPR.\n\u00a0\nThe first \nquestion\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a07(c) and (e) of Directive 95/46 and points (c) and (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a06(3) of the GDPR, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding a national provision that provides for the placing online of personal data contained in the declaration of private interests that any head of an establishment receiving public funds is required to lodge with the national authority responsible for collecting such declarations and checking their content.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted at the outset that, under Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 95/46, read in conjunction with recital\u00a010 thereof, and Article\u00a01(2) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with recitals\u00a04 and 10 thereof, that directive and that regulation have the objective in particular of ensuring a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with respect to the processing of personal data; that right is also recognised in Article\u00a08 of the Charter and is closely connected to the right to respect for private life, enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, Chapter II of Directive 95/46 and Chapters II and III of the GDPR set out the principles governing the processing of personal data and the rights of the data subject which the processing must observe. In particular, all processing of personal data was required, before the GDPR was applicable, to comply with the principles relating to data quality and the criteria for making data processing legitimate set out in Articles\u00a06 and 7 of that directive and, once the GDPR was applicable, to comply with the principles relating to processing of data and the conditions governing lawfulness of processing listed in Articles\u00a05 and 6 of that regulation (see, to that effect, judgments of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a096, and of 24\u00a0February 2022, \nValsts ie\u0146\u0113mumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)\n, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraph\u00a050).\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, Article\u00a010(1) of the Law on the reconciliation of interests provides that the Chief Ethics Commission is to publish on its website the information set out in the declarations of private interests which are submitted by the public officials referred to in that provision and the content of which is defined in Article\u00a06(1) of that law, with the exception of the information listed in Article\u00a010(2) thereof.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be pointed out, in that regard, that the questions referred to the Court relate solely to the publication, on the Chief Ethics Commission\u2019s website, of the information set out in the declaration of private interests that the head of an establishment receiving public funds is required to lodge, and not to the obligation to declare in itself or to the publication of a declaration of interests in other circumstances. \n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where information intended to be published on the Chief Ethics Commission\u2019s website relates to natural persons identified by their forename and surname, it constitutes personal data, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR, and the fact that that information was provided in the context of the declarant\u2019s professional activity does not mean that it cannot be so characterised (judgment of 9\u00a0March 2017, \nManni\n, C-398/15, EU:C:2017:197, paragraph\u00a034 and the case-law cited). Furthermore, the operation of loading personal data on an internet page constitutes processing, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2015, \nWeltimmo\n, C-230/14, EU:C:2015:639, paragraph\u00a037), in respect of which the Chief Ethics Commission is the controller, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR (see, by analogy, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a0101). \n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That having been explained, it should be examined whether Article\u00a07 of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a06 of the GDPR, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, preclude publication on the internet of part of the personal data set out in the declaration of private interests that any head of an establishment receiving public funds is required to lodge, such as the publication provided for in Article\u00a010 of the Law on the reconciliation of interests.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a07 of Directive 95/46 and the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR set out an exhaustive and restrictive list of the cases in which processing of personal data can be regarded as lawful. Thus, in order to be capable of being regarded as such, processing must fall within one of the cases provided for in those provisions (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a099 and the case-law cited).\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a07(e) of Directive 95/46 and point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, which are mentioned by the referring court in its first question, processing that is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller is lawful. In addition, under Article\u00a07(c) of that directive and under point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, a provision to which that court referred in the grounds of its request for a preliminary ruling, processing that is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject is also lawful. \n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06(3) of the GDPR specifies, in respect of those two situations where processing is lawful, that the processing must be based on EU law or on Member State law to which the controller is subject, and that that legal basis must meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Since those requirements constitute an expression of the requirements arising from Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, they must be interpreted in the light of the latter provision and must apply \nmutatis mutandis \n to Article\u00a07(c) and (e) of Directive 95/46.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should indeed be borne in mind that the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society and be weighed against other fundamental rights. Limitations may therefore be imposed, so long as, in accordance with Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, they are provided for by law, respect the essence of the fundamental rights and observe the principle of proportionality. Under the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others. They must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary and the legislation which entails the interference must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a0105 and the case-law cited).\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, given that the publication, on the Chief Ethics Commission\u2019s website, of part of the personal data set out in the declaration of private interests that any head of an establishment receiving public funds is required to lodge results from a legislative provision of the Member State law to which the Chief Ethics Commission is subject, that is to say, from Article\u00a010 of the Law on the reconciliation of interests, that processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation which is binding on that authority as controller and, therefore, falls within the situation envisaged in Article\u00a07(c) of Directive 95/46 and point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR. That being so, it is not necessary to determine whether that processing also falls within the situation envisaged in Article\u00a07(e) of that directive and point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation. \n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, since, as is apparent from paragraph\u00a063 of the present judgment, Article\u00a010 of the Law on the reconciliation of interests defines the scope of the limitation on the exercise of the right to the protection of personal data, the interference that it entails must be regarded as provided for by law, within the meaning of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0February 2022, \nValsts ie\u0146\u0113mumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)\n, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraph\u00a054).\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as has been stated in paragraph\u00a069 of the present judgment, Article\u00a010 of the Law on the reconciliation of interests, as the legal basis for the processing at issue in the main proceedings, must also fulfil the other requirements arising from Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter and Article\u00a06(3) of the GDPR, and in particular must meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. \n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, it is apparent from Article\u00a01 of the Law on the reconciliation of interests that, in adopting the principle of transparency of declarations of interest, that law seeks to ensure that the public interest takes precedence when decisions are taken by persons working in the public service, to guarantee the impartiality of those decisions, and to prevent situations of conflict of interests and the emergence and spread of corruption in the public service. \n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such objectives, in that they seek to strengthen the safeguards for probity and impartiality of public sector decision makers, to prevent conflicts of interest and to combat corruption in the public sector, are undeniably objectives of public interest and, accordingly, legitimate. \n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, ensuring that public sector decision makers perform their duties impartially and objectively and preventing them from being influenced by considerations relating to private interests have the aim of guaranteeing the proper management of public affairs and public property.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, combating corruption is an objective that the Member States have endorsed at both international and EU level.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, at EU level, the Member States have acceded to the Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of Member States of the European Union, under which each Member State is required to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that both active and passive corruption involving officials is a criminal offence. \n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At international level, Article\u00a01 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption states that the purposes of that convention are, inter alia, to promote and strengthen measures to prevent and combat corruption more efficiently and effectively, and to promote integrity, accountability and proper management of public affairs and public property. To that end, Article\u00a07(4) of the convention provides that \u2018each State Party shall, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its domestic law, endeavour to adopt, maintain and strengthen systems that promote transparency and prevent conflicts of interest\u2019.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing considerations that the processing of personal data pursuant to the Law on the reconciliation of interests is intended to meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union, within the meaning of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, and objectives that are of public interest and therefore legitimate, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(3) of the GDPR.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, in accordance with those provisions, the objectives referred to in paragraphs\u00a074 and 75 of the present judgment authorise limitations on the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, provided in particular that the limitations genuinely meet those objectives and are proportionate to them.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, it must be ascertained whether the placing online, on the Chief Ethics Commission\u2019s website, of part of the personal data contained in the declaration of private interests that any head of an establishment receiving public funds is required to lodge with that authority is appropriate for achieving the objectives of general interest defined in Article\u00a01 of the Law on the reconciliation of interests and does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives (see, by analogy, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a0109).\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns, first of all, the question whether publication on the Chief Ethics Commission\u2019s website of personal data contained in declarations of private interest is appropriate for achieving the objective of general interest defined in Article\u00a01 of the Law on the reconciliation of interests, it should be pointed out that the placing online of some of the personal data contained in the declarations of private interests of public sector decision makers, in that it enables the existence of possible conflicts of interest liable to influence the performance of their duties to be revealed, is such as to induce them to act impartially. Thus, such implementation of the principle of transparency is capable of preventing conflicts of interest and corruption, of increasing the accountability of public sector actors and, therefore, of strengthening citizens\u2019 trust in their actions.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the measure at issue in the main proceedings appears appropriate for contributing to the achievement of the objectives of general interest that it pursues.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, next, the requirement of necessity, it is apparent from recital\u00a039 of the GDPR that that requirement is met where the objective of general interest pursued cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights of data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and\u00a08 of the Charter, since derogations and limitations in relation to the principle of protection of such data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a0110 and the case-law cited). Consequently, it should be ascertained in the present instance whether the objective of preventing conflicts of interest and corruption in the public sector by reinforcing the probity and impartiality of public officials might reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other measures less restrictive of the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data of heads of establishments receiving public funds.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That assessment must be carried out in the light of all the matters of fact and law specific to the Member State concerned\u00a0\u2013 such as the existence of other measures designed to prevent conflicts of interest and combat corruption, and the scale of such conflicts and of the phenomenon of corruption within the public service\u00a0\u2013 and of the nature of the information at issue and the importance of the duties carried out by the declarant, in particular his or her hierarchical position, the extent of the powers of public administration with which he or she may be vested and the powers that he or she has in relation to the commitment and management of public funds.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, first, it should be noted that, as can be gathered from paragraph\u00a043 of the present judgment, the referring court seems to take the view that the obligation to declare private interests to the organs referred to in Articles\u00a05 and 22 of the Law on the reconciliation of interests and the checking by those organs of compliance with that obligation and of the declaration\u2019s content would enable the objectives pursued by that law, namely preventing conflicts of interest and combating corruption in the public sector, to be achieved just as effectively.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the explanations provided by the referring court, one of the main arguments put forward by the Chief Ethics Commission in the main proceedings to justify publication of the declarations of private interest is the fact that it does not have sufficient human resources to check effectively all the declarations that are submitted to it.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it must be pointed out that a lack of resources allocated to the public authorities cannot in any event constitute a legitimate ground justifying interference with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question also arises as to whether it is strictly necessary, in order to achieve the objectives of general interest referred to in Article\u00a01 of the Law on the reconciliation of interests, that heads of establishments receiving public funds be, like the other categories of functions covered by the list in Article\u00a010(1) of that law, subject to the public disclosure that that law prescribes.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Lithuanian Government has stated before the Court that the obligation to provide a declaration of impartiality, to which those heads are subject under national law, is sufficient to achieve the objectives of the Law on the reconciliation of interests and that, therefore, application of Article\u00a010 of that law to them, which was required until the Law on the reconciliation of interests as amended entered into force on 1\u00a0January 2020, went beyond what is strictly necessary in the light of those objectives.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, even if publication of the private data at issue in the main proceedings were to prove necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued by the Law on the reconciliation of interests, it is to be noted that a potentially unlimited number of persons may consult the personal data at issue. However, it is not apparent from the documents before the Court that the Lithuanian legislature, when adopting that provision, examined whether publication of those data on the internet without any restriction of access is strictly necessary or whether the objectives pursued by the Law on the reconciliation of interests might be achieved just as effectively if the number of persons able to consult those data is limited.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, in any event, it is to be borne in mind that the condition relating to the necessity of processing must be examined in conjunction with the \u2018data minimisation\u2019 principle, enshrined in Article\u00a06(1)(c) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a05(1)(c) of the GDPR, under which personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (see, to that effect, judgment of 11\u00a0December 2019, \nAsocia\u0163ia de Proprietari bloc M5A\n-\nScaraA\n, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraph\u00a048).\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, only data the publication of which is actually capable of strengthening the safeguards for probity and impartiality of public officials, preventing conflicts of interest and combating corruption in the public sector may be subject to processing of the kind provided for in Article\u00a010(1) of the Law on the reconciliation of interests.\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, it is clear from Article\u00a010(2) of the Law on the reconciliation of interests, and from the explanations provided by the referring court in response to the request by the Court for information, that the majority of the data that have to be set out in the declaration of private interests, pursuant to Article\u00a06(1) of that law, are intended to be published on the Chief Ethics Commission\u2019s website, with the exception, inter alia, of the data subjects\u2019 personal identification number.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whilst, with a view to preventing conflicts of interest and corruption in the public sector, it may be appropriate to require information enabling the declarant to be identified and information relating to the activities of the declarant\u2019s spouse, cohabitee or partner to be set out in the declarations of private interests, the public disclosure, online, of name-specific data relating to the spouse, cohabitee or partner of a head of an establishment receiving public funds, and to close relatives, or other persons known by the declarant, liable to give rise to a conflict of interests, seems to go beyond what is strictly necessary. As the Advocate General has observed in point\u00a066 of his Opinion, it does not appear that the objectives of public interest pursued could not be achieved if, for the purposes of publication, reference were solely made generically to a spouse, cohabitee or partner, as the case may be, together with the relevant indication of the interests held by those persons in relation to their activities.\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does it appear that the systematic publication, online, of the list of the declarant\u2019s transactions the value of which is greater than EUR\u00a03\u00a0000 is strictly necessary in the light of the objectives pursued. \n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, it must be borne in mind that an objective of general interest may not be pursued without having regard to the fact that it must be reconciled with the fundamental rights affected by the measure, by properly balancing the objective of general interest against the rights at issue (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a052). Consequently, for the purpose of assessing the proportionality of the processing at issue in the main proceedings, it is necessary to measure the seriousness of the interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data that that processing involves and to determine whether the importance of the objective of general interest pursued by the processing is proportionate to the seriousness of the interference.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to assess the seriousness of that interference, account must be taken, inter alia, of the nature of the personal data at issue, in particular of any sensitivity of those data, and of the nature of, and specific methods for, the processing of the data at issue, in particular of the number of persons having access to those data and the methods of accessing them (judgment of 11\u00a0December 2019, \nAsocia\u0163ia de Proprietari bloc M5A\n-\nScaraA\n, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraph\u00a057). \n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, first, the public disclosure, online, of name-specific data relating to the declarant\u2019s spouse, partner or cohabitee, or to persons who are close relatives of the declarant, or are known by him or her, liable to give rise to a conflict of interests, and mention of the subject of transactions the value of which is greater than EUR\u00a03\u00a0000 are liable to reveal information on certain sensitive aspects of the data subjects\u2019 private life, including, for example, their sexual orientation. Furthermore, since it envisages such public disclosure of name-specific data relating to persons other than the declarant in his or her capacity as a public sector decision maker, the processing of personal data that is provided for in Article\u00a010 of the Law on the reconciliation of interests also concerns persons who do not have that capacity and in respect of whom the objectives pursued by that law are not imperative in the same way as for the declarant.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The seriousness of such an infringement may still be increased by the cumulative effect of the personal data that are published as in the main proceedings, since combining them enables a particularly detailed picture of the data subjects\u2019 private lives to be built up (see, to that effect, Opinion\u00a01/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0128).\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, it is not in dispute that that processing has the effect of making those personal data freely accessible on the internet to the whole of the general public and, accordingly, to a potentially unlimited number of persons. \n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, that processing is liable to enable those data to be freely accessed by persons who, for reasons unrelated to the objective of general interest of preventing conflicts of interest and corruption in the public sector, seek to find out about the personal, material and financial situation of the declarant and the members of his or her family (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a0118). \n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, as the Advocate General has observed in point\u00a078 of his Opinion, publication of those data is liable, for example, to expose the persons concerned to repeated targeted advertising and commercial sales canvassing, or even to risks of criminal activity.\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, processing, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, of the personal data referred to in paragraph\u00a0100 of the present judgment must be regarded as constituting a serious interference with the fundamental rights of data subjects to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data.\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The seriousness of that interference must be weighed against the importance of the objectives of preventing conflicts of interest and corruption in the public sector.\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court considers it useful, for the purpose of pointing out the importance within the European Union of the objective of combating corruption, to take into consideration the content of the report of the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 3\u00a0February 2014 entitled \u2018EU Anti-Corruption Report\u2019 (COM(2014)\u00a038 final), according to which corruption\u00a0\u2013 which impinges on good governance, sound management of public money, and competitive markets\u00a0\u2013 hampers economic development, undermines democracy and damages social justice and the rule of law, and is capable of undermining the trust of citizens in democratic institutions and processes. The report states that the whole of the European Union is affected by that phenomenon, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the Member State.\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption adopted by the Council of Europe refers to corruption in its fourth recital as a \u2018[threat to] the rule of law, democracy and human rights [which] undermines good governance, fairness and social justice, distorts competition, hinders economic development and endangers the stability of democratic institutions and the moral foundations of society\u2019.\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, it is undeniable that combating corruption is of great importance within the European Union.\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the weighing of the interference resulting from the publication of personal data contained in the declarations of private interest against the objectives of general interest of preventing conflicts of interest and corruption in the public sector involves taking into consideration, inter alia, the fact and the extent of the phenomenon of corruption within the public service of the Member State concerned, so that the result of the weighing up to be carried out of those objectives, on the one hand, and a data subject\u2019s rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, on the other, is not necessarily the same for all the Member States (see, by analogy, judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGoogle (Territorial scope of de-referencing)\n, C-507/17, EU:C:2019:772, paragraph\u00a067).\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as follows from paragraph\u00a086 of the present judgment, for the purpose of that balancing exercise, account must be taken inter alia of the fact that the general interest in personal data being published may vary according to the importance of the duties carried out by the declarant, in particular his or her hierarchical position, the extent of the powers of public administration with which he or she may be vested and the powers that he or she has in relation to the commitment and management of public funds (see, by analogy, judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a081). \n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That having been explained, it must be found that the publication online of the majority of the personal data contained in the declaration of private interests of any head of an establishment receiving public funds, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, does not meet the requirements of a proper balance. In comparison with an obligation to declare coupled with a check of the declaration\u2019s content by the Chief Ethics Commission the effectiveness of which it is for the Member State concerned to ensure by endowing that body with the means necessary for that purpose, such publication amounts to a considerably more serious interference with the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, without that increased interference being capable of being offset by any benefits which might result from publication of all those data for the purpose of preventing conflicts of interest and combating corruption.\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is there anything in the documents before the Court to indicate that safeguards against the risks of abuse, such as the risks referred to in paragraphs\u00a0103 and 104 of the present judgment, are provided for by the national legislation applicable to the dispute in the main proceedings.\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, however, the data relating to the membership of the declarant\u00a0\u2013 or, without being name-specific, to the membership of the declarant\u2019s spouse, cohabitee or partner\u00a0\u2013 of undertakings, establishments, associations or funds, to their activities as self-employed persons and to the legal persons of which they are members, it must be held that transparency as to whether or not such interests exist enables citizens and economic operators to have an accurate picture of the financial independence of the persons who are vested with decision-making power in the management of public funds. Furthermore, the data concerning gifts received, other than from close relatives, the value of which exceeds EUR\u00a0150 are capable of revealing the existence of acts of corruption.\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subject to the requirement to strike a fair balance in the light of the extent of the declarant\u2019s decision-making power, and provided that the principle of data minimisation is observed, the publication of such data contained in the declaration of interests may be justified by the benefits which, by strengthening the safeguards for probity and impartiality of public officials, such transparency brings in respect of the prevention of conflicts of interest and the combating of corruption.\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a07(c) of Directive 95/46 and point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a06(3) of the GDPR, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 52(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that provides for the publication online of the declaration of private interests that any head of an establishment receiving public funds is required to lodge, in so far as, in particular, that publication concerns name-specific data relating to his or her spouse, cohabitee or partner, or to persons who are close relatives of the declarant, or are known by him or her, liable to give rise to a conflict of interests, or concerns any transaction concluded during the last 12 calendar months the value of which exceeds EUR\u00a03\u00a0000. \n\u00a0\nThe \nsecond question\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the publication, on the website of the public authority responsible for collecting and checking the content of declarations of private interests, of personal data that are liable to disclose indirectly the political opinions, trade union membership or sexual orientation of a natural person constitutes processing of special categories of personal data, for the purpose of those provisions.\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR provide for the prohibition, inter alia, of processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of data concerning a natural person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation. According to the heading of those articles, these are special categories of personal data, and such data are also categorised as \u2018sensitive data\u2019 in recital\u00a034 of that directive and recital\u00a010 of that regulation.\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, although the personal data the publication of which is mandatory pursuant to Article\u00a010(1) of the Law on the reconciliation of interests are not, inherently, sensitive data for the purpose of Directive 95/46 and the GDPR, the referring court takes the view that it is possible to deduce from the name-specific data relating to the spouse, cohabitee or partner of the declarant certain information concerning the sex life or sexual orientation of the declarant and his or her spouse, cohabitee or partner.\n120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, it should be determined whether data that are capable of revealing the sexual orientation of a natural person by means of an intellectual operation involving comparison or deduction fall within the special categories of personal data, for the purpose of Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR.\n121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to settled case-law, for the purpose of interpreting a provision of EU law it is necessary to consider not only its wording but also its context and the objectives of the legislation of which it forms part (judgment of 21\u00a0December 2021, \nBank Melli Iran\n, C-124/20, EU:C:2021:1035, paragraph\u00a043 and the case-law cited).\n122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 95/46 states that Member States are to prohibit the processing of personal data \u2018revealing\u2019 racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and the processing of data \u2018concerning\u2019 health or sex life. Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR provides that, inter alia, processing of personal data \u2018revealing\u2019 racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of data \u2018concerning\u2019 health or data \u2018concerning\u2019 a natural person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation, are to be prohibited.\n123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General has observed, in essence, in point\u00a085 of his Opinion, whilst the use, in those provisions, of the verb \u2018reveal\u2019 is consistent with the taking into account of processing not only of inherently sensitive data, but also of data revealing information of that nature indirectly, following an intellectual operation involving deduction or cross-referencing, the preposition \u2018concerning\u2019 seems, on the other hand, to signify the existence of a more direct and immediate link between the processing and the data concerned, viewed inherently.\n124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such an interpretation, which would result in a distinction being drawn according to the type of sensitive data at issue, would not, however, be consistent with a contextual analysis of those provisions, in particular with Article\u00a04(15) of the GDPR, according to which \u2018data concerning health\u2019 are personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which \u2018reveal\u2019 information about his or her health status, and with recital\u00a035 of that regulation, which states that personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which \u2018reveal\u2019 information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject.\n125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, a wide interpretation of the terms \u2018special categories of personal data\u2019 and \u2018sensitive data\u2019 is confirmed by the objective of Directive 95/46 and the GDPR, noted in paragraph\u00a061 of the present judgment, which is to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular of their private life, with respect to the processing of personal data concerning them (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a050).\n126\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The contrary interpretation would, moreover, run counter to the purpose of Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR, namely to ensure enhanced protection as regards processing which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data processed, is liable to constitute, as follows from recital\u00a033 of Directive 95/46 and recital\u00a051 of the GDPR, a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and\u00a08 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a044).\n127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, those provisions cannot be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data that are liable indirectly to reveal sensitive information concerning a natural person is excluded from the strengthened protection regime prescribed by those provisions, if the effectiveness of that regime and the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons that it is intended to ensure are not to be compromised.\n128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the publication, on the website of the public authority responsible for collecting and checking the content of declarations of private interests, of personal data that are liable to disclose indirectly the sexual orientation of a natural person constitutes processing of special categories of personal data, for the purpose of those provisions.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a07(c) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a06(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive\u00a095/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 52(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that provides for the publication online of the declaration of private interests that any head of an establishment receiving public funds is required to lodge, in so far as, in particular, that publication concerns name-specific data relating to his or her spouse, cohabitee or partner, or to persons who are close relatives of the declarant, or are known by him or her, liable to give rise to a conflict of interests, or concerns any transaction concluded during the last 12 calendar months the value of which exceeds EUR\u00a03\u00a0000.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a08(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a09(1) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the publication, on the website of the public authority responsible for collecting and checking the content of declarations of private interests, of personal data that are liable to disclose indirectly the sexual orientation of a natural person constitutes processing of special categories of personal data, for the purpose of those provisions."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

whereas Member States should therefore lay down exemptions and derogations necessary for the purpose of balance between fundamental rights as regards general measures on the legitimacy of data processing, measures on the transfer of data to third countries and the power of the supervisory authority; whereas this should not, however, lead Member States to lay down exemptions from the measures to ensure security of processing; whereas at least the supervisory authority responsible for this sector should also be provided with certain ex-post powers, e.g. to publish a regular report or to refer matters to the judicial authorities.\u2019 \n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 13 of the directive, entitled \u2018Exemptions and restrictions\u2019, states:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States may adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Articles 6(1), 10, 11(1), 12 and 21 when such a restriction constitutes a necessary measure to safeguard:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0national security;\n\u2026\u2019 \n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 17 of the directive, entitled \u2018Security of processing\u2019, provides: \n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall provide that the controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing. \nHaving regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation, such measures shall ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States shall provide that the controller must, where processing is carried out on his behalf, choose a processor providing sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical security measures and organisational measures governing the processing to be carried out, and must ensure compliance with those measures.\n\u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\nNational legislation\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 10(1) of the Constitution (Perustuslaki (731/1999)) of 11 June 1999 states: \n\u2018The right to privacy, honour and the inviolability of the home of every person shall be guaranteed.

More detailed provisions relating to the exercise of the right to freedom of expression shall be laid down by law. \u2026\u2019\nDocuments and other records in the possession of the authorities shall be in the public domain, unless specifically restricted by law for compelling reasons. Every person shall have the right of access to public documents and records.\u2019\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Law on personal data (Henkil\u00f6tietolaki (523/1999)) of 22 April 1999, which transposed the directive into national law, applies to the processing of those data (Paragraph 2(1)), apart from personal data files which contain solely, and in unaltered form, material that has been published in the media (Paragraph 2(4)). It applies only in part to the processing of personal data for journalistic purposes and for the purpose of artistic or literary expression (Paragraph 2(5)). \n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 32 of the Law on personal data provides that the controller is to take all technical and organisational measures necessary in order to protect personal data against unauthorised access to those data, and their accidental or unlawful destruction, alteration, disclosure or transfer, together with any other unlawful processing of those data. \n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Law on public access in relation to official activities (Laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta (621/1999))\u00a0of 21 May 1999 also governs access to information.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 1(1) of the Law on public access in relation to official activities states that the general principle is that documents covered by that law are to be in the public domain. \n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 9 of that law provides that every person is to have the right of access to a public document held by the public authorities. \n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 16(1) of that law lays down the detailed rules governing access to a document of that kind. It provides that the public authorities are to explain the contents of the document orally, make the document available in their offices where it may be studied, copied or listened to, or issue a copy or a print-out of the document concerned. \n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 16(3) of that law specifies the circumstances in which data in files containing personal data kept by the public authorities may be disclosed:\n\u2018A file containing personal data may be disclosed in the form of a print-out, or those data may be disclosed in electronic form, unless provided otherwise by law, if the recipient is authorised to store and use such data by virtue of the provisions governing the protection of personal data. However, access to personal data for the purposes of direct marketing, market surveys or market research shall not be permitted unless specifically provided for by law or if the data subject has given his consent.\u2019\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national court states that the provisions of the Law on the public disclosure and confidentiality of tax information (Laki verotustietojen julkisuudesta ja salassapidosta (1346/1999)) of 30 December 1999 are to prevail over those of the Law on personal data and the Law on public access in relation to official activities.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 2 of the Law on the public disclosure and confidentiality of tax information provides that the provisions of the Law on public access in relation to official activities and the Law on personal data are to apply to documents and information relating to tax matters, save as may be otherwise provided in a legislative measure. \n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 3 of the Law on the public disclosure and confidentiality of tax information states:\n\u2018Information relating to tax matters shall be in the public domain in accordance with the detailed rules laid down in this law. \nEvery person shall have the right to obtain access to a document relating to tax matters which is in the public domain and held by the tax authorities, in accordance with the detailed rules laid down in the Law on public access in relation to official activities, subject to the exceptions laid down in this law.\u2019\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 5(1) of the Law on the public disclosure and confidentiality of tax information provides that details of the taxpayer\u2019s name, his date of birth and his municipality of residence, as set out in his annual tax return, are to be in the public domain. The following information is also in the public domain:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earned income for the purposes of national taxation;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unearned income and income from property for the purposes of national taxation;\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earned income for the purposes of municipal taxation;\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taxes on income and property, municipal taxes and the total amount of taxes and charges levied.\n\u2026\u2019\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, Paragraph 8 of Chapter 24 of the Criminal Code (Rikoslaki), in the version brought into force by Law 531/2000, imposes penalties in respect of the disclosure of information which infringes an individual\u2019s right to privacy. Under those provisions, it is an offence to disseminate, through the media or otherwise, any information, innuendo or images relating to the private life of another person where to do so would be liable to cause harm or suffering to the person concerned or to bring that person into disrepute. \n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred \n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For several years, Markkinap\u00f6rssi has collected public data from the Finnish tax authorities for the purposes of publishing extracts from those data in the regional editions of the \nVerop\u00f6rssi \nnewspaper each year. \n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The information contained in those publications comprises the surname and given name of approximately 1.2 million natural persons whose income exceeds certain thresholds as well as the amount, to the nearest EUR 100, of their earned and unearned income and details relating to wealth tax levied on them. That information is set out in the form of an alphabetical list and organised according to municipality and income bracket. \n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the order for reference, the \nVerop\u00f6rssi \nnewspaper carries a statement that the personal data disclosed may be removed on request and without charge. \n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While that newspaper also contains articles, summaries and advertisements, its main purpose is to publish personal tax information. \n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Markkinap\u00f6rssi transferred personal data published in the \nVerop\u00f6rssi\n newspaper, in the form of CD-ROM discs, to Satamedia, which is owned by the same shareholders, with a view to those data being disseminated by a text-messaging system. In that connection, those companies signed an agreement with a mobile telephony company which put in place, on Satamedia\u2019s behalf, a text-messaging service allowing mobile telephone users to receive information published in the \nVerop\u00f6rssi \nnewspaper on their telephone, for a charge of approximately EUR 2. Personal data are removed from that service on request. \n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tietosuojavaltuutettu and the Tietosuojalautakunta, who are the Finnish authorities responsible for data protection, supervise the processing of personal data and have the regulatory powers laid down in the Law on personal data. \n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following complaints from individuals alleging infringement of their right to privacy, on 10 March 2004, the Tietosuojavaltuutettu responsible for investigating the activities of Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia requested the Tietosuojalautakunta to prohibit the latter from carrying on the personal data processing activities at issue.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That request having been rejected by the Tietosuojalautakunta, the Tietosuojavaltuutettu brought proceedings before the Helsingin hallinto-oikeus (Administrative Court, Helsinki), which also rejected his application. The Tietosuojavaltuutettu then brought an appeal before the Korkein hallinto-oikeus (Supreme Administrative Court). \n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national court emphasises that the appeal brought by the Tietosuojavaltuutettu does not concern the transfer of information by the Finnish authorities. It also states that the public nature of the tax data in question is not at issue. On the other hand, it has concerns as regards the subsequent processing of those data.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \n\u2018(1) \u00a0Can an activity in which data relating to the earned and unearned income and assets of natural persons are:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0collected from documents in the public domain held by the tax authorities and processed for publication,\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0published alphabetically in printed form by income bracket and municipality in the form of comprehensive lists,\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0transferred onward on CD-ROM to be used for commercial purposes, and\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processed for the purposes of a text-messaging service whereby mobile telephone users can, by sending a text message containing details of an individual\u2019s name and municipality of residence to a given number, receive in reply information concerning the earned and unearned income and assets of that person,\nbe regarded as the processing of personal data within the meaning of Article 3(1) of [the directive]?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is [the directive] to be interpreted as meaning that the various activities listed in Question 1(a) to (d) can be regarded as the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes within the meaning of Article 9 of the directive, having regard to the fact that data on over one million taxpayers have been collected from information which is in the public domain under national legislation on the right of public access to information? Does the fact that publication of those data is the principal aim of the operation have any bearing on the assessment in this case?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article 17 of [the directive] to be interpreted in conjunction with the principles and purpose of the directive as precluding the publication of data collected for journalistic purposes and its onward transfer for commercial purposes?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is [the directive] to be interpreted as meaning that personal data files containing, solely and in unaltered form, material that has already been published in the media fall altogether outside its scope?\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be held that the data to which this question relates, which comprise the surname and given name of certain natural persons whose income exceeds certain thresholds as well as the amount, to the nearest EUR 100, of their earned and unearned income, constitute personal data within the meaning of Article 2(a) of the directive, since they constitute \u2018information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019 (see also Joined Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others \n[2003] ECR I-4989, paragraph\u00a064).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is sufficient to hold, next, that it is clear from the wording itself of the definition set out in Article 2(b) of the directive that the activity to which the question relates involves the \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of that provision.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the answer to the first question must be that Article 3(1) of the directive is to be interpreted as meaning that an activity in which data on the earned and unearned income and the assets of natural persons are:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0collected from documents in the public domain held by the tax authorities and processed for publication,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0published alphabetically in printed form by income bracket and municipality in the form of comprehensive lists,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0transferred onward on CD-ROM to be used for commercial purposes, and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processed for the purposes of a text-messaging service whereby mobile telephone users can, by sending a text message containing details of an individual\u2019s name and municipality of residence to a given number, receive in reply information concerning the earned and unearned income and assets of that person,\nmust be considered as the \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of that provision. \n\u00a0\nThe fourth question\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, which should be examined next, the national court asks, in essence, whether activities involving the processing of personal data such as those referred to at points (c) and (d) of the first question and relating to personal data files which contain solely, and in unaltered form, material that has already been published in the media, fall within the scope of application of the directive.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By virtue of Article 3(2) of the directive, the directive does not apply to the processing of personal data in two situations. \n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first situation involves the processing of personal data undertaken in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union and, in any case, to processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the processing operation relates to State security matters) and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those activities, which are mentioned by way of example in the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) are, in any event, activities of the State or of State authorities unrelated to the fields of activity of individuals. They are intended to define the scope of the exception provided for there, with the result that that exception applies only to the activities which are expressly listed there or which can be classified in the same category (\nejusdem generis\n) (see Case C-101/01 \nLindqvist\n [2003] ECR I-12971, paragraphs 43 and 44).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Activities involving the processing of personal data of the kind referred to at points (c) and (d) of the first question concern the activities of private companies. Those activities do not fall in any way within a framework established by the public authorities that relates to public security. Consequently, such activities cannot be assimilated to those covered by Article 3(2) of the directive (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-317/04 and C-318/04 \nParliament \nv \nCouncil \n[2006] ECR I-4721, paragraph 58). \n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the second situation, which is covered by the second indent of that provision, recital 12 in the preamble to the directive \u2013 relating to that exception \u2013 mentions as examples of data processing carried out by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity, correspondence and the holding of records of addresses.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the latter exception must be interpreted as relating only to activities which are carried out in the course of private or family life of individuals (see \nLindqvist\n, paragraph 47). That clearly does not apply to the activities of Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia, the purpose of which is to make the data collected accessible to an unrestricted number of people. \n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must therefore be held that activities involving the processing of personal data of the kind referred to at points (c) and (d) of the first question are not covered by any of the situations referred to in Article 3(2) of the directive.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it should be pointed out that the directive does not lay down any further limitation of its scope of application.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Advocate General observes at point 125 of her Opinion that Article 13 of the directive permits derogations from its provisions only in certain cases, which do not extend to the provisions of Article 3.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, it must be held that a general derogation from the application of the directive in respect of published information would largely deprive the directive of its effect. It would be sufficient for the Member States to publish data in order for those data to cease to enjoy the protection afforded by the directive.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the fourth question should therefore be that activities involving the processing of personal data such as those referred to at points (c) and (d) of the first question and relating to personal data files which contain solely, and in unaltered form, material that has already been published in the media, fall within the scope of application of the directive. \n\u00a0\nThe second question\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the national court asks, in essence, whether Article 9 of the directive should be interpreted as meaning that the activities referred to at points (a) to (d) of the first question, relating to data from documents which are in the public domain under national legislation, must be considered as activities involving the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes. The national court states that it seeks clarification as to whether the fact that the principal aim of those activities is the publication of the data in question is relevant to the determination of that issue.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be observed, as a preliminary point, that, according to settled case-law, the provisions of a directive must be interpreted in the light of the aims pursued by the directive and the system it establishes (see, to that effect, Case C-265/07 \nCaffaro\n [2008] ECR I-0000, paragraph 14).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is not in dispute that, as is apparent from Article 1 of the directive, its objective is that the Member States should, while permitting the free flow of personal data, protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That objective cannot, however, be pursued without having regard to the fact that those fundamental rights must, to some degree, be reconciled with the fundamental right to freedom of expression.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 9 of the directive refers to such a reconciliation. As is apparent, in particular, from recital 37 in the preamble to the directive, the object of Article 9 is to reconcile two fundamental rights: the protection of privacy and freedom of expression. The obligation to do so lies on the Member States.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to reconcile those two \u2018fundamental rights\u2019 for the purposes of the directive, the Member States are required to provide for a number of derogations or limitations in relation to the protection of data and, therefore, in relation to the fundamental right to privacy, specified in Chapters II, IV and VI of the directive. Those derogations must be made solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression, which fall within the scope of the fundamental right to freedom of expression, in so far as it is apparent that they are necessary in order to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression. \n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society, it is necessary, first, to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly. Secondly, and in order to achieve a balance between the two fundamental rights, the protection of the fundamental right to privacy requires that the derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data provided for in the chapters of the directive referred to above must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. \n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the following points are relevant.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, as the Advocate General pointed out at point 65 of her Opinion and as is apparent from the legislative history of the directive, the exemptions and derogations provided for in Article 9 of the directive apply not only to media undertakings but also to every person engaged in journalism.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, the fact that the publication of data within the public domain is done for profit-making purposes does not, prima facie, preclude such publication being considered as an activity undertaken \u2018solely for journalistic purposes\u2019. As Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia state in their observations and as the Advocate General noted at point 82 of her Opinion, every undertaking will seek to generate a profit from its activities. A degree of commercial success may even be essential to professional journalistic activity.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, account must be taken of the evolution and proliferation of methods of communication and the dissemination of information. As was mentioned by the Swedish Government in particular, the medium which is used to transmit the processed data, whether it be classic in nature, such as paper or radio waves, or electronic, such as the internet, is not determinative as to whether an activity is undertaken \u2018solely for journalistic purposes\u2019. \n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all of the above that activities such as those involved in the main proceedings, relating to data from documents which are in the public domain under national legislation, may be classified as \u2018journalistic activities\u2019 if their object is the disclosure to the public of information, opinions or ideas, irrespective of the medium which is used to transmit them. They are not limited to media undertakings and may be undertaken for profit-making purposes.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the second question should therefore be that Article 9 of the directive is to be interpreted as meaning that the activities referred to at points (a) to (d) of the first question, relating to data from documents which are in the public domain under national legislation, must be considered as activities involving the processing of personal data carried out \u2018solely for journalistic purposes\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, if the sole object of those activities is the disclosure to the public of information, opinions or ideas. Whether that is the case is a matter for the national court to determine.\nThe third question\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the national court asks, in essence, whether Article 17 of the directive should be interpreted as meaning that it precludes the publication of data which have been collected for journalistic purposes and their onward transfer for commercial purposes.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the answer given to the second question, there is no need to reply to this question. \n\u00a0\nCosts\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle 3(1) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data is to be interpreted as meaning that an activity in which data on the earned and unearned income and the assets of natural persons are:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\ncollected from documents in the public domain held by the tax authorities and processed for publication,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\npublished alphabetically in printed form by income bracket and municipality in the form of comprehensive lists,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\ntransferred onward on CD-ROM to be used for commercial purposes, and \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nprocessed for the purposes of a text-messaging service whereby mobile telephone users can, by sending a text message containing details of an individual\u2019s name and municipality of residence to a given number, receive in reply information concerning the earned and unearned income and assets of that person, \nmust be considered as the \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of that provision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle 9 of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that the activities referred to at points (a) to (d) of the first question, relating to data from documents which are in the public domain under national legislation, must be considered as activities involving the processing of personal data carried out \u2018solely for journalistic purposes\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, if the sole object of those activities is the disclosure to the public of information, opinions or ideas. Whether that is the case is a matter for the national court to determine. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nActivities involving the processing of personal data such as those referred to at points (c) and (d) of the first question and relating to personal data files which contain solely, and in unaltered form, material that has already been published in the media, fall within the scope of application of Directive 95/46."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Such processing includes \u201cprofiling\u201d that consists of any form of automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning the data subject\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, where it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. However, decision-making based on such processing, including profiling, should be allowed where expressly authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring and prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations, standards and recommendations of [European] Union institutions or national oversight bodies and to ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by the controller, or necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data subject and a controller, or when the data subject has given his or her explicit consent. In any case, such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards, which should include specific information to the data subject and the right to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge the decision. Such measure should not concern a child.\nIn order to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed, the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures appropriate to ensure, in particular, that factors which result in inaccuracies in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors is minimised, secure personal data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks involved for the interests and rights of the data subject and that prevents, inter alia, discriminatory effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religion

To that end, it establishes a prognosis on the probability of a future behaviour of a person (\u2018score\u2019), such as the repayment of a loan, based on certain characteristics of that person, on the basis of mathematical and statistical procedures. The establishment of scores (\u2018scoring\u2019) is based on the assumption that, by assigning a person to a group of other persons with comparable characteristics who have behaved in a certain way, similar behaviour can be predicted.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling that OQ was refused the granting of a loan by a third party after having been the subject of negative information established by SCHUFA and transmitted to that third party. OQ applied for SCHUFA to send her information on the personal data registered and to erase some of the data which was allegedly incorrect.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In response to that request, SCHUFA informed OQ of her score and outlined, in broad terms, the methods for calculating the scores. However, referring to trade secrecy, it refused to disclose the various elements taken into account for the purposes of that calculation and their weighting. Lastly, SCHUFA stated that it limited itself to sending information to its contractual partners and it was those contractual partners which made the actual contractual decisions.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By a complaint lodged on 18\u00a0October 2018, OQ asked the HBDI, the competent supervisory authority, to order SCHUFA to grant her request for access to information and erasure.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 3\u00a0June 2020, the HBDI rejected that application for an order, explaining that it was not established that SCHUFA did not comply with the requirements set out in Article\u00a031 of the BDSG incumbent upon it with regard to its activity.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OQ appealed against that decision before the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court, Wiesbaden, Germany), the referring court, in accordance with Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to that court, it is important to determine, for the purposes of ruling on the dispute before it, whether the establishment of a probability value such as that at issue in the main proceedings constitutes automated individual decision-making within the meaning of Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR. If that question is answered in the affirmative, the lawfulness of that activity would be subject, under Article\u00a022(2)(b) of that regulation, to the condition that that decision be authorised by EU law or Member State law to which the controller is subject. \n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring court has doubts as to the argument that Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR is not applicable to the activity of companies such as SCHUFA. It bases its doubts, from a factual point of view, on the importance of a probability value such as that at issue in the main proceedings for the decision-making practice of third parties to which that probability value is transmitted and, from a legal point of view, mainly on the objectives pursued by that Article\u00a022(1), and on the guarantees of legal protection enshrined by the GDPR.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, the referring court notes that it is the probability value which normally determines whether and how the third party will contract with the person concerned. Article\u00a022 of the GDPR precisely aims to protect people against the risks linked to decisions purely based on automation.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, if Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR were to be interpreted as meaning that the status of \u2018automated individual decision-making\u2019 cannot be recognised, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, until the decision taken by the third party with regard to the data subject, this would result in a lacuna in legal protection. First, a company such as SCHUFA would not be required to provide access to the additional information to which the data subject is entitled under Article\u00a015(1)(h) of that regulation because that company would not be the company which adopts \u2018automated decision-making\u2019 within the meaning of that provision and, consequently, within the meaning of Article\u00a022(1) of that regulation. Secondly, the third party to whom the probability value is communicated could not provide that additional information because it does not have it.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, according to the referring court, to avoid such a lacuna in legal protection, it would be necessary for the establishment of a probability value such as that at issue in the main proceedings to fall within the scope of application of Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If such an interpretation were to be accepted, the lawfulness of that activity would then be subject to the existence of a legal basis at the level of the Member State concerned, under Article\u00a022(2)(b) of that regulation. In the present case, while it is true that Article\u00a031 of the BDSG may constitute such a legal basis in Germany, there are serious doubts as to the compatibility of that provision with Article\u00a022 of the GDPR because the German legislature regulates only the \u2018use\u2019 of a probability value such as that at issue in the main proceedings, and not the establishment in itself of that value.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, if the establishment of such a probability value does not constitute automated individual decision-making within the meaning of Article\u00a022 of the GDPR, the opening clause appearing in paragraph\u00a02(b) of that Article\u00a022 would also not apply to national regulations regarding that activity. In view of the exhaustive, in principle, nature of the GDPR and in the absence of any other normative competence for such national regulations, it seems that the German legislature, by subjecting the establishment of probability values to more advanced conditions of substantive lawfulness, specifies the regulated matter by going beyond the requirements set out in Articles\u00a06 and 22 of the GDPR, without having regulatory power for this purpose. If this point of view were to be correct, this would modify the margin of examination of the national supervisory authority, which would then have to assess the compatibility of the activity of credit information agencies in the light of Article\u00a06 of that regulation.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court, Wiesbaden) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a022(1) of the [GDPR] to be interpreted as meaning that the automated establishment of a probability value concerning the ability of a data subject to service a loan in the future already constitutes a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning the data subject or similarly significantly affects him or her, where that value, determined by means of personal data of the data subject, is transmitted by the controller to a third-party controller and the latter draws strongly on that value for its decision on the establishment, implementation or termination of a contractual relationship with the data subject?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the first question is answered in the negative:\nare Articles\u00a06(1) and 22 of the [GDPR] to be interpreted as precluding national legislation under which the use of a probability value\u00a0\u2013 in the present case, in relation to a natural person\u2019s ability and willingness to pay, in the case where information about claims against that person is taken into account\u00a0\u2013 regarding specific future behaviour of a natural person for the purpose of deciding on the establishment, implementation or termination of a contractual relationship with that person (scoring) is permissible only if certain further conditions, which are set out in more detail in the grounds of the request for a preliminary ruling, are met?\u2019\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility of the request for a preliminary ruling\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SCHUFA challenges the admissibility of the request for a preliminary ruling by arguing, in the first place, that the referring court is not called upon to review the content of a decision on a complaint, adopted by a supervisory authority such as the HBDI, since the judicial remedy against such a decision, provided for in Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR, serves only to verify whether that authority has complied with the obligations incumbent upon it under that regulation, in particular that of processing complaints, it being specified that that authority has discretion to decide whether and how it should act.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, SCHUFA maintains that the referring court does not set out the specific reasons why the questions referred would be decisive for the resolution of the dispute in the main proceedings. The purpose of the latter would be a request for information on an actual score and the erasure of that score. In the present case, SCHUFA has sufficiently complied with its information obligation and has already erased the score subject to the procedure.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law of the Court, it is solely for the national court hearing the case, which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, with regard to the particular aspects of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it refers to the Court. Consequently, where the questions submitted concern the interpretation of a rule of EU law, the Court is in principle bound to give a ruling (judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \nDOBELES HES\n, C-702/20 and C-17/21, EU:C:2023:1, paragraph\u00a046 and the case-law cited).\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, questions concerning EU law enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to give a ruling on a question referred by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of a rule of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \nDOBELES HES\n, C-702/20 and C-17/21, EU:C:2023:1, paragraph\u00a047 and the case-law cited).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the first place, the plea of inadmissibility based on an allegedly limited judicial review to which decisions on complaints adopted by a supervisory authority are subject, it should be borne in mind that, under Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR, without prejudice to any other administrative or non-judicial remedy, each natural or legal person is to have the right to an effective judicial remedy against a legally binding decision of a supervisory authority concerning them.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the decision adopted by the HBDI as supervisory authority constitutes a legally binding decision, within the meaning of Article\u00a078(1) of the GDPR. Having examined the merits of the complaint brought before it, that authority ruled on it and found that the processing of personal data contested by the applicant in the main proceedings was lawful. \n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the extent of the judicial review exercised over such a decision in the context of an action brought under Article\u00a078(1), it is sufficient to note that a decision on a complaint adopted by a supervisory authority is subject to full judicial review (judgment of 7\u00a0December 2023, \nSCHUFA Holding (Discharge from remaining debts)\n, C-26/22 and C-64/22, EU:C:2023:XXX, point\u00a01 of the operative part).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first plea of inadmissibility put forward by SCHUFA must therefore be rejected.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it is clear from the request for a preliminary ruling that the referring court questions the criterion of review to be used when assessing, in the light of the GDPR, the processing of the personal data at issue in the main proceedings, that criterion depending on the applicability or not of Article\u00a022(1) of that regulation.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it is not clear that the interpretation of the GDPR sought by the referring court bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose and that the problem is hypothetical. Furthermore, the Court has before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the second plea of inadmissibility put forward by SCHUFA must also be rejected.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the request for a preliminary ruling is admissible.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the automated establishment, by a credit information agency, of a probability value based on personal data relating to a person and concerning his or her ability to meet payment commitments in the future constitutes \u2018automated individual decision-making\u2019 within the meaning of that provision, where a third party, to which that probability value is transmitted, draws strongly on that probability value to establish, implement or terminate a contractual relationship with that person.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer that question, it should be borne in mind, as a preliminary point, that the interpretation of a provision of EU law requires that account be taken not only of its wording, but also of its context and the objectives and purpose pursued by the act of which it forms part (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2023, \nPankki S\n, C-579/21, EU:C:2023:501, paragraph\u00a038 and the case-law cited).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the wording of Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR, that provision provides that the data subject is to have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicability of that provision is therefore subject to three cumulative conditions, namely, first, that there must be a \u2018decision\u2019, secondly, that that decision must be \u2018based solely on automated processing, including profiling\u2019, and, thirdly, that it must produce \u2018legal effects concerning [the interested party]\u2019 or \u2018similarly significantly [affect] him or her\u2019.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, first, the condition relating to the existence of a decision, it should be noted that the concept of \u2018decision\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR, is not defined by that regulation. However, it is apparent from the very wording of that provision that that concept refers not only to acts which produce legal effects concerning the person at issue but also to acts which similarly significantly affect him or her.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The broad scope of the concept of \u2018decision\u2019 is confirmed by recital\u00a071 of the GDPR, according to which a decision evaluating personal aspects relating to a person, to which that person should have the right not to be subject, \u2018may include a measure\u2019 which either produces \u2018legal effects concerning him or her\u2019, or, \u2018similarly significantly affects him or her\u2019. Under that recital, the term \u2018decision\u2019 covers, for example, the automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without human intervention.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concept of \u2018decision\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR is thus, as the Advocate General noted in point\u00a038 of his Opinion, capable of including a number of acts which may affect the data subject in many ways, since that concept is broad enough to encompass the result of calculating a person\u2019s creditworthiness in the form of a probability value concerning that person\u2019s ability to meet payment commitments in the future.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, secondly, the condition according to which the decision, within the meaning of that Article\u00a022(1), must be \u2018based solely on automated processing, including profiling\u2019, as the Advocate General noted in point\u00a033 of his Opinion, it is common ground that an activity such as that of SCHUFA meets the definition of \u2018profiling\u2019 appearing in Article\u00a04(4) of the GDPR and therefore that that condition is met in the present case, since the wording of the first question referred explicitly refers to the automated establishment of a probability value based on personal data relating to a person and concerning that person\u2019s ability to repay a loan in the future.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, thirdly, the condition that the decision must produce \u2018legal effects\u2019 concerning the person at issue or affect him or her \u2018similarly significantly\u2019, it is apparent from the very wording of the first question referred that the action of the third party to whom the probability value is transmitted draws \u2018strongly\u2019 on that value. Thus, according to the factual findings of the referring court, in the event where a loan application is sent by a consumer to a bank, an insufficient probability value leads, in almost all cases, to the refusal of that bank to grant the loan applied for.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it must be stated that the third condition to which the application of Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR is subject is also fulfilled, since a probability value such as that at issue in the main proceedings affects, at the very least, the data subject significantly.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, in which the probability value established by a credit information agency and communicated to a bank plays a determining role in the granting of credit, the establishment of that value must be qualified in itself as a decision producing vis-\u00e0-vis a data subject \u2018legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly [affecting] him or her\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is corroborated by the context in which Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR takes place and by the objectives and purpose pursued by that regulation.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, it is important to note that, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a031 of his Opinion, Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR confers on the data subject the \u2018right\u2019 not to be the subject of a decision solely based on automated processing, including profiling. That provision lays down a prohibition in principle, the infringement of which does not need to be invoked individually by such a person.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As follows from a combined reading of Article\u00a022(2) of the GDPR and recital\u00a071 of that regulation, the adoption of a decision based solely on automated processing is authorised only in the cases referred to in that Article\u00a022(2), namely where that decision is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller (point (a)), where it is authorised by EU or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests (point (b)), or where it is based on the data subject\u2019s explicit consent (point (c)).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Article\u00a022 of the GDPR provides, in paragraphs\u00a02(b) and 3 thereof, that suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests must be taken. In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of Article\u00a022(2) of that regulation, the data controller is to implement at least the right of the data subject to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, under Article\u00a022(4) of the GDPR, it is only in certain specific cases that automated individual decision-making within the meaning of Article\u00a022 are to be based on special categories of personal data referred to in Article\u00a09(1) of that regulation.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in the case of automated decision-making, such as that referred to in Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR, first, the controller is subject to additional information obligations under Article\u00a013(2)(f) and Article\u00a014(2)(g) of that regulation. Secondly, the data subject enjoys, under Article\u00a015(1)(h) of that regulation, the right to obtain from the controller, in particular, \u2018meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject\u2019.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those enhanced requirements as to the lawfulness of automated decision-making and the additional information obligations of the controller and the related additional rights of access of the data subject are explained by the purpose pursued by Article\u00a022 of the GDPR, consisting of protecting individuals against the particular risks to their rights and freedoms represented by the automated processing of personal data, including profiling.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That processing involves, as is apparent from recital\u00a071 of the GDPR, the evaluation of personal aspects relating to the natural person concerned by that processing, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning the data subject\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those particular risks are, under that recital, likely to weigh on the legitimate interests and rights of the data subject, in particular taking account of discriminatory effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religion or beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or health status or sexual orientation. It is therefore important, still according to that recital, to provide suitable safeguards and to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, in particular through the use of appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling and the implementation of technical and organisational measures appropriate to ensure that the risk of errors is minimised.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The interpretation set out in paragraphs\u00a042 to 50 of this judgment, and in particular the broad scope of the concept of \u2018decision\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR, reinforces the effective protection intended by that provision.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, in which three stakeholders are involved, there would be a risk of circumventing Article\u00a022 of the GDPR and, consequently, a lacuna in legal protection if a restrictive interpretation of that provision was retained, according to which the establishment of the probability value must only be considered as a preparatory act and only the act adopted by the third party can, where appropriate, be classified as a \u2018decision\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a022(1) of that regulation.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that situation, the establishment of a probability value such as that at issue in the main proceedings would escape the specific requirements provided for in Article\u00a022(2) to (4) of the GDPR, even though that procedure is based on automated processing and that it produces effects significantly affecting the data subject to the extent that the action of the third party to whom that probability value is transmitted draws strongly on it.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as the Advocate General noted in point\u00a048 of his Opinion, first, the data subject would not be able to assert, from the credit information agency which establishes the probability value concerning him or her, his or her right of access to the specific information referred to in Article\u00a015(1)(h) of the GDPR, in the absence of automated decision-making by that company. Secondly, even assuming that the act adopted by the third party falls within the scope of Article\u00a022(1) of that regulation in so far as it fulfils the conditions for application of that provision, that third party would not be able to provide that specific information because it generally does not have it.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that the establishment of a probability value such as that at issue in the main proceedings is covered by Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR has the consequence, as noted in paragraphs\u00a053 to 55 of this judgment, that it is prohibited unless one of the exceptions set out in Article\u00a022(2) of that regulation is applicable and the specific requirements provided for in Article\u00a022(3) and (4) of that regulation are complied with. \n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard, more specifically, to Article\u00a022(2)(b) of the GDPR, to which the referring court refers, it is apparent from the very wording of that provision that the national law which authorises the adoption of an automated individual decision must lay down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests. \n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of recital\u00a071 of the GDPR, such measures must include, in particular, the obligation for the controller to use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures, implement technical and organisational measures appropriate to ensure that the risk of errors is minimised and inaccuracies are corrected, and secure personal data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks involved for the interests and rights of the data subject and prevent, inter alia, discriminatory effects on that person. Those measures include, moreover, at least the right for the data subject to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to challenge the decision taken in his or her regard.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also important to note that, in accordance with the settled case-law of the Court, any processing of personal data must, first, comply with the principles relating to the processing of data established in Article\u00a05 of the GDPR and, secondly, in the light, in particular, of the principle of the lawfulness of processing, laid down in Article\u00a05(1)(a), satisfy one of the conditions of the lawfulness of the processing listed in Article\u00a06 of that regulation (judgment of 20\u00a0October 2022, \nDigi\n, C-77/21, EU:C:2022:805, paragraph\u00a049 and the case-law cited). The controller must be able to demonstrate compliance with those principles, in accordance with the principle of accountability set out in Article\u00a05(2) of that regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 20\u00a0October 2022, \nDigi\n, C-77/21, EU:C:2022:805, paragraph\u00a024).\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in the event that the law of a Member State authorises, under Article\u00a022(2)(b) of the GDPR, the adoption of a decision solely based on automated processing, that processing must comply not only with the conditions set out in the latter provision and in Article\u00a022(4) of that regulation, but also with the requirements set out in Articles\u00a05 and 6 of that regulation. Accordingly, Member States cannot adopt, under Article\u00a022(2)(b) of the GDPR, regulations which authorise profiling in disregard of the requirements laid down by those Articles\u00a05 and 6, as interpreted by the case-law of the Court.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard in particular to the conditions of lawfulness, provided for in Article\u00a06(1)(a), (b), and (f) of the GDPR, which are likely to apply in a case such as that at issue in the main proceedings, Member States are not empowered to provide additional rules for the implementation of those conditions, such an option being, in accordance with Article\u00a06(3) of that regulation, limited to the reasons referred to in Article\u00a06(1)(c) and (e) of that regulation.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, with regard more specifically to Article\u00a06(1)(f) of the GDPR, Member States cannot, under Article\u00a022(2)(b) of that regulation, dismiss the requirements resulting from the case-law of the Court following the judgment of 7\u00a0December 2023, \nSCHUFA Holding (Discharge from remaining debts)\n (C-26/22 and C-64/22, EU:C:2023:XXX), in particular, by definitively prescribing the result of the balancing of the rights and interests at issue (see, to that effect, judgment of 19\u00a0October 2016, \nBreyer\n, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph\u00a062).\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the referring court states that only Paragraph\u00a031 of the BDSG could constitute a national legal basis for the purposes of Article\u00a022(2)(b) of the GDPR. However, it has serious doubts as to the compatibility of Paragraph\u00a031 of the BDSG with EU law. Assuming that that provision is deemed incompatible with EU law, SCHUFA would act not only without legal basis, but would \nipso iure\n disregard the prohibition laid down in Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, it is for the referring court to verify whether Paragraph\u00a031 of the BDSG can be classified as a legal basis authorising, under Article\u00a022(2)(b) of the GDPR, the adoption of a decision solely based on automated processing. If that court were to reach the conclusion that Article\u00a031 of the GDPR constitutes such a legal basis, it would still be up to it to verify whether the conditions set out in Article\u00a022(2)(b) and (4) of the GDPR and those laid down in Articles\u00a05 and 6 of that regulation are fulfilled in this case.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a022(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the automated establishment, by a credit information agency, of a probability value based on personal data relating to a person and concerning his or her ability to meet payment commitments in the future constitutes \u2018automated individual decision-making\u2019 within the meaning of that provision, where a third party, to which that probability value is transmitted, draws strongly on that probability value to establish, implement or terminate a contractual relationship with that person.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the answer to the first question, there is no need to answer the second question.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a022(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the automated establishment, by a credit information agency, of a probability value based on personal data relating to a person and concerning his or her ability to meet payment commitments in the future constitutes \u2018automated individual decision-making\u2019 within the meaning of that provision, where a third party, to which that probability value is transmitted, draws strongly on that probability value to establish, implement or terminate a contractual relationship with that person."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}
