The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 5 May 2011, C-543/09 (\nDeutsche Telekom\n)\nCharter of fundamental

relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) (OJ 2002 L\u00a0108, p.\u00a051) and of Article 12 of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of

and, on the other, the Federal Republic of Germany, represented by the Bundesnetzagentur f\u00fcr Elektrizit\u00e4t, Gas, Telekommunikation, Post und Eisenbahnen (Federal Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post and Rail Networks) (\u2018the Bundesnetzagentur\u2019) concerning the obligation, imposed by the Telekommunikationsgesetz (German Law on Telecommunications) (\u2018TKG\u2019), on undertakings which assign telephone numbers to make available, to other undertakings whose activity consists in providing publicly available directory enquiry services and directories, data in their possession relating to subscribers of third-party undertakings.\n\u00a0\nLegal context\n\u00a0\nEuropean Union (\u2018EU\u2019) legislation\n\u00a0Directive 95/46/EC\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1(1) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L 281, p. 31) states that that directive is aimed at protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data.\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 2(h) of Directive 95/46 defines \u2018the data subject\u2019s consent\u2019 as being \u2018any freely given specific and informed indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed\u2019.\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 7(a) of that directive provides that personal data may be processed if \u2018the data subject has unambiguously given his consent\u2019.\n\u00a0The ONP Directive\n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As from 1 January 1998, the provision of telecommunications services and infrastructures was liberalised in the European Union. That liberalisation coincided with the establishment of a harmonised regulatory framework which included Directive 98/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\u00a0February 1998 on the application of open network provision (ONP) to voice telephony and on universal service for telecommunications in a competitive environment (OJ 1998 L\u00a0101, p. 24; \u2018the ONP Directive\u2019).\n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ONP Directive was repealed by Article 26 of Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) (OJ 2002 L\u00a0108, p.\u00a033). Article 6(3) of the ONP Directive provided:\n\u2018In order to ensure provision of [directory and directory enquiry services], Member States shall ensure that all organisations which assign telephone numbers to subscribers meet all reasonable requests to make available the relevant information in an agreed format on terms which are fair, cost oriented and non-discriminatory.\u2019\n\u00a0The common regulatory framework\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is stated in recital 1 in the preamble to the Framework Directive, a few years after the liberalisation of the telecommunications markets, the conditions for effective competition had been created and a common regulatory framework (\u2018CRF\u2019) had been adopted. The CRF includes the Framework Directive, the Universal Service Directive and also the Directive on privacy and electronic communications.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Framework Directive\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1(1) of the Framework Directive states:\n\u2018This Directive establishes a harmonised framework for the regulation of electronic communications services \u2026 It lays down tasks of national regulatory authorities and establishes a set of procedures to ensure the harmonised application of the regulatory framework throughout the Community.\u2019\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Framework Directive gives national regulatory authorities (\u2018NRAs\u2019) specific tasks for regulating electronic communications markets. Thus, under Article 16 of that directive, the NRAs are to carry out an analysis of the relevant markets in the electronic communications sector and to determine whether those markets are effectively competitive. If a market is not effectively competitive, the competent NRA is to impose specific regulatory obligations on undertakings with significant power on that market.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Universal Service Directive\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals 11 and 35 to the Universal Service Directive state:\n\u2018(11)\u00a0Directory information and a directory enquiry service constitute an essential access tool for publicly available telephone services and form part of the universal service obligation. Users and consumers desire comprehensive directories and a directory enquiry service covering all listed telephone subscribers and their numbers (including fixed and mobile numbers) and want this information to be presented in a non-preferential fashion. Directive\u00a097/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\u00a0December 1997 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector [OJ 1998 L 24, p. 1] ensures the subscribers\u2019 right to privacy with regard to the inclusion of their personal information in a public directory. \n\u2026\n(35)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provision of directory enquiry services and directories is already open to competition. The provisions of this Directive complement the provisions of Directive 97/66/EC by giving subscribers a right to have their personal data included in a printed or electronic directory. All service providers which assign telephone numbers to their subscribers are obliged to make relevant information available in a fair, cost-oriented and non-discriminatory manner.\u2019\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 5 of the Universal Service Directive, which is entitled \u2018Directory enquiry services and directories\u2019, provided, in the version in force at the material time:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0at least one comprehensive directory is available to end-users in a form approved by the relevant authority, whether printed or electronic, or both, and is updated on a regular basis, and at least once a year;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0at least one comprehensive telephone directory enquiry service is available to all end-users, including users of public pay telephones.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The directories in paragraph 1 shall comprise, subject to the provisions of Article 11 of Directive 97/66/EC, all subscribers of publicly available telephone services.\n\u2026\u2019\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article 17 of the Universal Service Directive, the NRAs \u2013 after carrying out a retail market analysis and after determining that the relevant market is not effectively competitive \u2013 are to impose appropriate regulatory obligations on undertakings identified as having significant market power.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 25 of the Universal Service Directive, which is entitled \u2018Operator assistance and directory enquiry services\u2019, provided, in the version in force at the material time:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that subscribers to publicly available telephone services have the right to have an entry in the publicly available directory referred to in Article 5(1)(a).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that all undertakings which assign telephone numbers to subscribers meet all reasonable requests to make available, for the purposes of the provision of publicly available directory enquiry services and directories, the relevant information in an agreed format on terms which are fair, objective, cost-oriented and non-discriminatory.\n\u2026\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraphs 1, 2 \u2026 apply subject to the requirements of Community legislation on the protection of personal data and privacy and, in particular, Article\u00a011 of Directive 97/66/EC.\u2019\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Directive on privacy and electronic communications\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals 38 and 39 to the Directive on privacy and electronic communications state:\n\u2018(38)\u00a0Directories of subscribers to electronic communications services are widely distributed and public. The right to privacy of natural persons and the legitimate interest of legal persons require that subscribers are able to determine whether their personal data are published in a directory and if so, which. Providers of public directories should inform the subscribers to be included in such directories of the purposes of the directory and of any particular usage which may be made of electronic versions of public directories especially through search functions embedded in the software, such as reverse search functions enabling users of the directory to discover the name and address of the subscriber on the basis of a telephone number only.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The obligation to inform subscribers of the purpose(s) of public directories in which their personal data are to be included should be imposed on the party collecting the data for such inclusion. Where the data may be transmitted to one or more third parties, the subscriber should be informed of this possibility and of the recipient or the categories of possible recipients. Any transmission should be subject to the condition that the data may not be used for other purposes than those for which they were collected. If the party collecting the data from the subscriber or any third party to whom the data have been transmitted wishes to use the data for an additional purpose, the renewed consent of the subscriber is to be obtained either by the initial party collecting the data or by the third party to whom the data have been transmitted.\u2019\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under paragraphs 1 to 3 of Article 12 of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications, which is entitled \u2018Directories of subscribers\u2019:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that subscribers are informed, free of charge and before they are included in the directory, about the purpose(s) of a printed or electronic directory of subscribers available to the public or obtainable through directory enquiry services, in which their personal data can be included and of any further usage possibilities based on search functions embedded in electronic versions of the directory. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that subscribers are given the opportunity to determine whether their personal data are included in a public directory, and if so, which, to the extent that such data are relevant for the purpose of the directory as determined by the provider of the directory, and to verify, correct or withdraw such data. Not being included in a public subscriber directory, verifying, correcting or withdrawing personal data from it shall be free of charge.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States may require that for any purpose of a public directory other than the search of contact details of persons on the basis of their name and, where necessary, a minimum of other identifiers, additional consent be asked of the subscribers.\u2019\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 19 of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications repealed Directive 97/66 with effect from 31 October 2003 and provided that \u2018[r]eferences made to the repealed Directive shall be construed as being made to this Directive\u2019. References to Article 11 of Directive 97/66 must therefore be construed as being references to Article 12 of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications.\n\u00a0\nNational legislation\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Bundesverwaltungsgericht, under Paragraphs 47(1), 104 and 105 of the TKG, read in conjunction, any undertaking which assigns telephone numbers to end-users is under an obligation to pass on to providers of publicly available directory enquiry services and directories who so request not only data relating to its own subscribers, but also data in its possession relating to subscribers of third-party service providers. The passing on of such data is not conditional on the consent, or lack of objection, of the subscribers concerned or their telephone service providers.\n\u00a0\nFacts and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its capacity as a telecommunications network operator in Germany, Deutsche Telekom assigns telephone numbers to its subscribers. It operates a nationwide telephone directory enquiry service. It also publishes printed and electronic directories containing data relating not only to its own customers, but also to subscribers of other undertakings. Deutsche Telekom acquires the data necessary for those purposes from the telephone service providers which assigned the telephone numbers to the subscribers concerned. In this way, it has concluded contracts for the acquisition of subscriber data with approximately 100\u00a0undertakings.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GoYellow GmbH (\u2018GoYellow\u2019) and Telix AG (\u2018Telix\u2019) \u2013 the interveners in the main proceedings \u2013 operate an internet enquiry service and a telephone directory enquiry service, respectively. They use data made available to them by Deutsche Telekom in return for payment. Following a disagreement as to the scope of the data which Deutsche Telekom was under an obligation to pass on to GoYellow and Telix, the latter companies brought the matter before the Bundesnetzagentur pursuant to Paragraphs 47(1), 104 and 105 of the TKG.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 11\u00a0September 2006, the Bundesnetzagentur ordered Deutsche Telekom to make available to GoYellow and Telix not only the data relating to Deutsche Telekom\u2019s own subscribers but also the data in its possession relating to the subscribers of third-party telephone service providers (\u2018the external data\u2019), even where those providers or their subscribers wished those data to be published only by Deutsche Telekom.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deutsche Telekom brought an action before the Verwaltungsgericht K\u00f6ln (Administrative Court, Cologne) against that decision of the Bundesnetzagentur.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By judgment of 14 February 2008, the Verwaltungsgericht K\u00f6ln dismissed the action. Deutsche Telekom then appealed on a point of law to the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court), submitting inter alia that an obligation to pass on data which encompasses external data infringes the Universal Service Directive.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the order for reference, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht explains that the dispute in the main proceedings is limited, on the one hand, to the obligation imposed on Deutsche Telekom to pass external data on to GoYellow and Telix and, on the other, to the data which the subscriber or his provider wishes to see published only by Deutsche Telekom. The Bundesverwaltungsgericht states that, on the basis of national law alone, the appeal on a point of law falls to be dismissed. It wonders, however, whether the obligation imposed by the national law applicable to the dispute before it is in conformity with EU law.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bundesverwaltungsgericht observes, first, that the judgment in Case C-109/03 \nKPN Telecom\n [2004] ECR I-11273 confirms that Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive requires an undertaking which assigns telephone numbers to pass on only data relating to its own subscribers. Secondly, accordingly to the Bundesverwaltungsgericht, the possibility cannot be ruled put that \u2013 in the light, inter alia, of the general purpose of the Framework Directive, which is to promote competition \u2013 EU law allows the national legislature to extend the obligation so as to make external data available. According to the Bundesverwaltungsgericht, gathering data from a single party is likely to forestall the significant impediments normally associated with procuring data from each individual undertaking which assigns telephone numbers when lists of data necessary for the provision of directory and directory enquiry services are established and especially when they are regularly updated; it is also likely to promote, on a lasting basis, strong competitive structures.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If it should transpire that the national legislature is justified in extending the scope of the obligation to make data available so that it covers external data held by the undertaking subject to that obligation, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht is uncertain as to whether Article 12 of the Universal Service Directive makes the passing on of that external data conditional on the consent of the subscribers concerned and of their telephone service provider.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article 25(2) of Directive 2002/22/EC of [the Universal Service Directive] be interpreted as meaning that Member States may require undertakings which assign telephone numbers to subscribers to make available data relating to subscribers to whom the undertaking in question has not itself assigned telephone numbers for the purpose of the provision of publicly available directory enquiry services and directories, in so far as that undertaking has such data in its possession? \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the answer to the previous question is in the affirmative:\nMust Article 12 of Directive 2002/58/EC of the [Directive on privacy and electronic communications] be interpreted as meaning that the imposition of the abovementioned obligation by the national legislature is conditional upon the consent of, or at least the lack of any objection by, the other telephone service provider or its subscribers to the passing on of the data?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht asks, in essence, whether Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which places undertakings assigning telephone numbers to end-users under an obligation to make available, to undertakings whose activity consists in providing publicly available directory enquiry services and directories, data in their possession relating to subscribers of third-party undertakings.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer that question, it is appropriate first to consider whether the external data at issue in the dispute in the main proceedings is \u2018relevant information\u2019 for the purposes of Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive, which undertakings assigning telephone numbers are required, under that provision, to pass on to undertakings whose activity consists in providing publicly available directory enquiry services and directories.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, under Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive, an obligation to pass on data is imposed only on \u2018undertakings which assign telephone numbers to subscribers\u2019. Given the link thus established between, on the one hand, that obligation to pass on data and, on the other, the assignment of a telephone number to a subscriber, it must be held that the \u2018relevant information\u2019 the communication of which is required under Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive concerns solely the data relating to the subscribers of the undertakings concerned: such a provision imposes an obligation on an undertaking, such as Deutsche Telekom, in its capacity as an undertaking which assigns telephone numbers and not in its capacity as a provider of directory enquiry services and directories.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is borne out by the objective pursued by Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive, which is to ensure compliance with the obligation of universal service as laid down in Article 5(1) of that directive, under which Member States are to ensure that at least one comprehensive directory or one comprehensive telephone directory enquiry service is made available to end-users. An obligation imposed on each undertaking which assigns telephone numbers to pass on data relating to its own subscribers enables the undertaking designated to provide the universal service in question to establish an exhaustive data base and, therefore, to ensure compliance with the obligation under Article 5(1).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In support of their argument that the obligation under Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive to pass on data also encompasses external data, the Bundesnetzagentur and the Italian Government refer to recital 11 to that directive and to the CRF\u2019s general objective of promoting competition.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that recital 11 to the Universal Service Directive states that \u2018[u]sers and consumers desire comprehensive directories and a directory enquiry service covering all listed telephone subscribers and their numbers \u2026\u2019. That recital must, however, be read in conjunction with the universal service obligation laid down in Article 5(1) of that directive, which does not require the Member States to ensure that all directories and telephone directory enquiry services are comprehensive. Under that provision, the Member States must ensure only that at least one comprehensive directory or one comprehensive telephone directory enquiry service is made available to end-users. As is apparent from paragraph 31 above, an obligation to pass on data which applies to undertakings assigning telephone numbers and which covers only data relating to their own subscribers is sufficient to ensure compliance with the universal service obligation under Article 5(1).\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does the CRF\u2019s general objective, which is to promote competition, support the view that an undertaking assigning telephone numbers to subscribers, such as Deutsche Telekom, is required under Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive to pass on to third-party undertakings data other than data relating to its own subscribers.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive must be interpreted in the light of its specific objective, which is to ensure compliance with the universal service obligation laid down in Article 5(1) of that directive.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, recital 35 to the Universal Service Directive states that the provision of directory enquiry services and directories is already open to competition. In a competitive market, the obligation under Article 25(2) of that directive for undertakings which assign telephone numbers to pass on data relating to their own subscribers in principle not only enables the designated undertaking to ensure compliance with the universal service obligation laid down in Article 5(1) of that directive, but also enables any provider of telephone services to establish an exhaustive data base and to become active in the market for telephone directory enquiry services and directories. In that connection, it is sufficient that the provider concerned ask each undertaking assigning telephone numbers for the relevant data relating to its subscribers.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that the \u2018relevant information\u2019 for the purposes of Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive, the communication of which is required under that provision, encompasses only information which relates to the subscribers of the undertakings assigning telephone numbers.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, it must be determined whether Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive undertakes full harmonisation or whether, on the contrary, that provision allows the Member States to impose on undertakings assigning telephone numbers an obligation to pass on to undertakings which intend to provide publicly available directory enquiry services and directories not only \u2018relevant information\u2019 for the purposes of that provision, but also external data.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind from the outset that, in paragraph 35 of its judgment in \nKPN Telecom\n, concerning the interpretation of Article 6(3) of the ONP Directive, the content of which is similar to that of Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive, the Court held that Article 6(3) did not seek to effect full harmonisation and that the Member States retained competence for determining whether in a specific national context certain additional data ought to be made available to third parties.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deutsche Telekom maintains, however, as do the United Kingdom Government and the European Commission, that Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive cannot be interpreted in that way, since it is part of the CRF, which \u2013 as is stated in Article 1(1) of the Framework Directive \u2013 is a harmonised framework for the regulation of electronic communications services. Accordingly, the national legislature may not impose on the undertakings concerned obligations which go beyond those laid down in Article 25(2).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should first be observed that Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive is part of Chapter IV of that directive, which concerns end-user interests and rights. Yet the Court has held that the Framework Directive and the Universal Service Directive do not provide for full harmonisation of consumer-protection aspects (Case C-522/08 \nTelekomunikacja Polska \n[2010] ECR I-0000, paragraph 29).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, it should be borne in mind that Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive is aimed at ensuring compliance with the obligation, placed on the Member States under Article 5(1) of that directive, to ensure that at least one comprehensive directory or one comprehensive telephone directory enquiry service is made available to end-users. Since that marks a minimum requirement which the Member States must satisfy, in principle they remain free to adopt more stringent provisions in order to facilitate the entry of new traders on the market for publicly available telephone and directory services.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the CRF does not preclude national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which, being directed at any undertaking which assigns telephone numbers to end-users, affects electronic communications undertakings in a general and non-discriminatory manner \u2013 provided, however, that such legislation does not encroach upon the powers which the NRAs derive directly from the provisions of the CRF (\nTelekomunikacja Polska\n, paragraphs 27 and 28; see also Case C-424/07 \nCommission\n v \nGermany\n [2009] ECR\u00a0I-11431, paragraphs\u00a078 and 91 to 99).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it must be held that national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings does not affect any of the powers expressly conferred by the CRF on the NRA concerned.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive does not confer any specific powers or impose any specific obligations on the NRAs. That provision imposes obligations only on the Member States as such.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings does not in any way affect the powers of the NRA concerned, arising under Article 16 of the Framework Directive and Article 17 of the Universal Service Directive, relating to the analysis of the various electronic communications markets and the imposition of regulatory obligations on undertakings with significant market power on markets which are not effectively competitive. None the less, the mere fact that, if the undertakings concerned comply with the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, the NRA will no longer need, after any analysis it may carry out of the retail market concerned, to take any specific measures \u2013 that is to say, to require undertakings with significant market power to pass on external data to third-party undertakings \u2013 does not support the inference that the powers which the NRA concerned derives from Article 17 of the Universal Service Directive are directly affected (see, by analogy, as regards a general prohibition of tied sales, \nTelekomunikacja Polska\n, paragraph 28).\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all the foregoing that the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a025(2) of the Universal Service Directive must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation under which undertakings assigning telephone numbers to end-users must make available to undertakings whose activity consists in providing publicly available directory enquiry services and directories not only data relating to their own subscribers but also data in their possession relating to subscribers of third-party undertakings.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht asks, in essence, whether Article 12 of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications makes the passing on, to an undertaking whose activity consists in providing publicly available directory enquiry services and directories, by an undertaking which assigns telephone numbers, of data in its possession relating to subscribers of a third-party undertaking conditional on the consent, or lack of objection, of that undertaking or its subscribers.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019) states that \u2018[e]veryone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her\u2019.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 95/46 is designed to ensure, in the Member States, observance of the right to protection of personal data. As is clear from Article 1(2) thereof, the Directive on privacy and electronic communications clarifies and supplements Directive 95/46 in the electronic communications sector.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right, but must be considered in relation to its function in society (Joined Cases C-92/09 and C-93/09 \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n [2010] ECR I-0000, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 8(2) of the Charter thus authorises the processing of personal data if certain conditions are satisfied. It provides that personal data \u2018must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law\u2019.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The passing of subscribers\u2019 personal data to a third-party undertaking which intends to provide publicly available directory enquiry services and directories constitutes processing of personal data for the purposes of Article 8(2) of the Charter, which may be undertaken only \u2018on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law\u2019.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the Directive on privacy and electronic communications makes it clear that that directive makes the publication, in printed or electronic directories, of personal data concerning subscribers conditional on the consent of those subscribers.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, Article 12(2) of that directive provides that subscribers are to be free to decide whether their personal data is to be included in a public directory and, if so, which personal data.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, there is no provision in the Directive on privacy and electronic communications which makes the publication of personal data relating to subscribers conditional on any consent from the undertaking which assigned the telephone numbers concerned or which has external data in its possession. Such an undertaking cannot, in its own right, rely on the right of prior consent, which is conferred solely on subscribers.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht also asks whether Article\u00a012 of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications makes the passing of personal data to a third-party undertaking whose activity consists in providing publicly available directory enquiry services and directories conditional on renewed consent from the subscriber, where the subscriber has consented to the publication of his personal data in one directory only, in this case the directory drawn up by Deutsche Telekom.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind from the outset that it is clear from Article 12(1) of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications and from recital 38 thereto that, before being included in public directories, subscribers are to be informed of the purposes of the directory and of any particular usage which may be made of it, in particular through search functions embedded in the software of the electronic versions of the directories. Such prior information gives the subscriber concerned the opportunity to give free, specific and informed consent, for the purposes of Articles 2(h) and 7(a) of Directive 95/46, to the publication of his personal data in public directories.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recital 39 to the Directive on privacy and electronic communications states, with respect to the obligation of prior information for subscribers under Article 12(1) of that directive: \u2018[w]here the [personal] data may be transmitted to one or more third parties, the subscriber should be informed of this possibility and of the recipient or the categories of possible recipients\u2019.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, after obtaining the information referred to in Article 12(1) of that directive, the subscriber may \u2013 as is clear from Article 12(2) \u2013 decide only whether his personal data may be included in a public directory and, if so, which personal data.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point 122 of her Opinion, it follows from a contextual and systematic interpretation of Article 12 of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications that the consent under Article 12(2) relates to the purpose of the publication of personal data in a public directory and not to the identity of any particular directory provider.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the wording of Article 12(2) of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications does not support the inference that the subscriber has a selective right to decide in favour of certain providers of publicly available directory enquiry services and directories. It should be noted in that regard that it is the publication itself of the personal data in a public directory with a specific purpose which may turn out to be detrimental for a subscriber. Where, however, the subscriber has consented to his data being published in a directory with a specific purpose, he will generally not have standing to object to the publication of the same data in another, similar directory.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, recital 39 to that directive confirms that the passing of subscribers\u2019 personal data to third parties is \u2018subject to the condition that the data may not be used for other purposes than those for which they were collected\u2019.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, the Directive on privacy and electronic communications refers to a situation in which provision can be made for the subscriber\u2019s renewed or specific consent. Thus, under Article 12(3) of that directive, Member States may require that, for any purpose of a public directory other than the search of contact details of persons on the basis of their name and, where necessary, a minimum of other identifiers, additional consent be asked of the subscribers. Recital 39 to that directive states that renewed consent should be obtained from the subscriber \u2018[i]f the party collecting the data from the subscriber or any third party to whom the data have been transmitted wishes to use the data for an additional purpose\u2019.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, where a subscriber has been informed by the undertaking which assigned him a telephone number of the possibility that his personal data may be passed to a third-party undertaking, such as Deutsche Telekom, with a view to being published in a public directory, and where he has consented to the publication of those data in such a directory (in the present case, Deutsche Telekom\u2019s directory), renewed consent is not needed from the subscriber for the passing of those same data to another undertaking which intends to publish a printed or electronic public directory, or to make such directories available for consultation through directory enquiry services, if it is guaranteed that the data in question will not be used for purposes other than those for which the data were collected with a view to their first publication. The consent given under Article\u00a012(2) of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications, by a subscriber who has been duly informed, to the publication of his personal data in a public directory relates to the purpose of that publication and thus extends to any subsequent processing of those data by third-party undertakings active in the market for publicly available directory enquiry services and directories, provided that such processing pursues that same purpose.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, where a subscriber has consented to the passing of his personal data to a given undertaking with a view to their publication in a public directory of that undertaking, the passing of the same data to another undertaking intending to publish a public directory without renewed consent having been obtained from that subscriber is not capable of substantively impairing the right to protection of personal data, as recognised in Article 8 of the Charter.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the answer to the second question is that Article 12 of the Directive\u00a0on privacy and electronic communications must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation under which an undertaking publishing public directories must pass personal data in its possession relating to subscribers of other telephone service providers to a third-party undertaking whose activity consists in publishing a printed or electronic public directory or making such directories obtainable through directory enquiry services and which does not make the passing on of those data conditional on renewed consent from the subscribers, provided, however, that those subscribers have been informed, before the first inclusion of their data in a public directory, of the purpose of that directory and of the fact that those data may be communicated to another telephone service provider and that it is guaranteed that those data will not, once passed on, be used for purposes other than those for which they were collected with a view to their first publication.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle 25(2) of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users\u2019 rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation under which undertakings assigning telephone numbers to end-users must make available to undertakings whose activity consists in providing publicly available directory enquiry services and directories not only data relating to their own subscribers but also data in their possession relating to subscribers of third-party undertakings.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle 12 of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation under which an undertaking publishing public directories must pass personal data in its possession relating to subscribers of other telephone service providers to a third-party undertaking whose activity consists in publishing a printed or electronic public directory or making such directories obtainable through directory enquiry services, and under which the passing on of those data is not conditional on renewed consent from the subscribers, provided, however, that those subscribers have been informed, before the first inclusion of their data in a public directory, of the purpose of that directory and of the fact that those data could be communicated to another telephone service provider and that it is guaranteed that those data will not, once passed on, be used for purposes other than those for which they were collected with a view to their first publication."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f),

Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 2 Mar 2021, C-746/18 (\nProkuratuur\n)\nCharter of fundamental rights

privacy and electronic communications) (OJ 2002 L\u00a0201, p.\u00a037), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009 (OJ 2009 L\u00a0337, p.\u00a011) (\u2018Directive 2002/58\u2019), read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019).\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The request has been made in the context of criminal proceedings brought against H.\u00a0K. on counts of theft, use of another

Therefore it does not alter the existing balance between the individual\u2019s right to privacy and the possibility for Member States to take the measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of this Directive, necessary for the protection of public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the activities relate to State security matters) and the enforcement of criminal law. Consequently, this Directive does not affect the ability of Member States to carry out lawful interception of electronic communications, or take other measures, if necessary for any of these purposes and in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, [signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950,] as interpreted by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.

Those authorisations, granted on 28\u00a0January and 2\u00a0February 2015, 2\u00a0November 2015 and 25\u00a0February 2016, related to data concerning several telephone numbers of H.\u00a0K. and various IMEI codes of hers, in respect of the period from 1\u00a0January to 2\u00a0February 2015, of 21\u00a0September 2015, and of the period from 1\u00a0March 2015 to 19\u00a0February 2016.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0H.\u00a0K. brought an appeal against the judgment of the Viru Maakohus (Court of First Instance, Viru) before the Tartu Ringkonnakohus (Court of Appeal, Tartu, Estonia), which dismissed the appeal by judgment of 17\u00a0November 2017.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0H.\u00a0K. lodged an appeal on a point of law against the latter judgment before the Riigikohus (Supreme Court, Estonia), contesting, inter alia, the admissibility of the reports drawn up on the basis of the data obtained from the provider of electronic communications services. In her submission, it follows from the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, \u2018\nTele2\n\u2019, EU:C:2016:970), that the provisions of Paragraph\u00a01111 of the Law on electronic communications which lay down the obligation on service providers to retain communications data, as well as the use of such data for the purpose of her conviction, are contrary to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, the question arises whether the reports drawn up on the basis of data referred to in Paragraph 1111(2) of the Law on electronic communications may be regarded as constituting admissible evidence. That court observes that the admissibility of the reports at issue in the main proceedings as evidence depends on the question of the extent to which the gathering of the data on the basis of which those reports were drawn up was in conformity with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court considers that, in order to answer that question, it needs to be determined whether Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that the access of State authorities to data making it possible to identify the source and destination of a telephone communication from a suspect\u2019s landline or mobile telephone, to determine the date, time, duration and type of that communication, to identify the communications equipment used and to establish the location of the mobile communication equipment used amounts to interference with the fundamental rights at issue which is so serious that such access should be restricted to combating serious crime, regardless of the period in respect of which the State authorities have sought access to the retained data.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court takes the view, however, that the length of that period is an essential factor for assessing the seriousness of the interference represented by access to traffic and location data. Thus, where that period is very short or the quantity of data gathered is very limited, the question should be raised whether the objective of combating crime in general, and not only combating serious crime, is capable of justifying such an interference.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the referring court has doubts as to whether it is possible to regard the Estonian public prosecutor\u2019s office as an independent administrative authority, for the purposes of paragraph\u00a0120 of the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), which is capable of authorising access of the investigating authority to data relating to electronic communications such as the data referred to in Paragraph 1111(2) of the Law on electronic communications.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states that the public prosecutor\u2019s office directs the pre-trial procedure, while guaranteeing its lawfulness and effectiveness. Since the objective of that procedure is, inter alia, to gather evidence, the investigating authority and the public prosecutor\u2019s office verify the circumstances incriminating and exonerating any suspect or person accused. If the public prosecutor\u2019s office is satisfied that all the necessary evidence has been gathered, it brings the public prosecution against the accused. The powers of the public prosecutor\u2019s office are exercised in its name by a public prosecutor who carries out his or her duties independently, as follows from Paragraph\u00a030(1) and (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Paragraphs\u00a01 and 2 of the Law on the public prosecutor\u2019s office.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the referring court observes that its doubts as to the independence required by EU law are principally attributable to the fact that the public prosecutor\u2019s office not only directs the pre-trial procedure, but also represents the public prosecution at the trial, that authority being, pursuant to national law, party to the criminal proceedings.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was in those circumstances that the Riigikohus (Supreme Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a015(1) of Directive [2002/58], in conjunction with Articles\u00a07, 8, 11 and 52(1) of the [Charter], to be interpreted as meaning that in criminal proceedings the access of State authorities to data making it possible to establish the source and destination, the date, the time, the duration and the type of the communication, the terminal used and the location of the mobile terminal used, in relation to a telephone or mobile telephone communication of a suspect, constitutes so serious an interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in those articles of the Charter that that access in the area of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences must be restricted to the fighting of serious crime, regardless of the period to which the retained data to which the State authorities have access relate?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a015(1) of Directive [2002/58], on the basis of the principle of proportionality expressed in the judgment of [2\u00a0October 2018,\n Ministerio Fiscal\n (C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788)], paragraphs\u00a055 to 57, to be interpreted as meaning that, if the amount of data mentioned in the first question, to which the State authorities have access, is not large (both in terms of the type of data and in terms of its temporal extent), the associated interference with fundamental rights is justified by the objective of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences generally, and that the greater the amount of data to which the State authorities have access, the more serious the criminal offences which are intended to be fought by the interference must be?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the requirement mentioned in the judgment of [21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970)], second point of the operative part, that the data access of the competent State authorities must be subject to prior review by a court or an independent administrative authority mean that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive [2002/58] must be interpreted as meaning that the public prosecutor\u2019s office which directs the pre-trial procedure, with it being obliged by law to act independently and only being bound by the law, and ascertains the circumstances both incriminating and exonerating the accused in the pre-trial procedure, but later represents the public prosecution in the judicial proceedings, may be regarded as an independent administrative authority?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe f\nirst and second\n questions\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first and second questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that permits public authorities to have access to a set of traffic or location data, that are liable to provide information regarding the communications made by a user of a means of electronic communication or regarding the location of the terminal equipment which he or she uses and to allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning his or her private life, for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, without such access being confined to procedures and proceedings to combat serious crime, regardless of the length of the period in respect of which access to those data is sought and the quantity and the nature of the data available in respect of such a period.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling that, as the Estonian Government confirmed at the hearing, the data to which the national investigating authority had access in the main proceedings is the data kept under Paragraph 1111(2) and (4) of the Law on electronic communications, which obliges providers of electronic communications services to retain, generally and indiscriminately, for one year traffic and location data so far as concerns fixed and mobile telephony. Those data make it possible, in particular, to trace and identify the source and destination of a communication from a person\u2019s landline or mobile telephone, to determine the date, time, duration and type of that communication, to identify the communications equipment used, and to establish the location of the mobile telephone without a communication necessarily being conveyed. In addition, they enable the frequency of a user\u2019s communications with certain persons over a given period of time to be established. Furthermore, as the Estonian Government confirmed at the hearing, access to those data may, in relation to combating crime, be sought in respect of any type of criminal offence.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the circumstances in which access to traffic and location data retained by providers of electronic communications services may, for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, be granted to public authorities, pursuant to a measure adopted under Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, the Court has held that such access may be granted only in so far as those data have been retained by a provider in a manner that is consistent with Article\u00a015(1) (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0167).\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this connection, the Court has also held that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, precludes legislative measures which, for such purposes, provide, as a preventive measure, for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0168).\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the objectives capable of justifying public authorities having access to data retained by providers of electronic communications services pursuant to a measure consistent with those provisions, it is apparent, first, from the Court\u2019s case-law that such access may be justified only by the public interest objective for which those service providers were ordered to retain the data (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0166).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Court has held that the question whether the Member States may justify a limitation on the rights and obligations laid down, inter alia, in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58 must be assessed by measuring the seriousness of the interference entailed by such a limitation and by verifying that the importance of the public interest objective pursued by that limitation is proportionate to the seriousness of the interference (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0131 and the case-law cited).\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns the objective of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences, which is pursued by the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, in accordance with the principle of proportionality only action to combat serious crime and measures to prevent serious threats to public security are capable of justifying serious interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, such as the interference entailed by the retention of traffic and location data, whether the retention be general and indiscriminate or targeted. Accordingly, only non-serious interference with those fundamental rights may be justified by the objective, pursued by the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences in general (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0140 and 146).\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it has inter alia been held that legislative measures concerning the processing of data in themselves relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems, including the retention of and access to those data, solely for the purpose of identifying the user concerned, and without it being possible for those data to be associated with information on the communications made, are capable of being justified by the objective of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences in general, to which the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 refers. Those data do not, in themselves, make it possible to ascertain the date, time, duration and recipients of the communications made, or the locations where those communications took place or their frequency with specific people during a given period, with the result that they do not provide, apart from the contact details of users of means of electronic communication, such as their addresses, any information on the communications sent and, consequently, on the users\u2019 private lives. Thus, the interference entailed by a measure relating to those data cannot, in principle, be classified as serious (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0157 and 158 and the case-law cited).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, only the objectives of combating serious crime or preventing serious threats to public security are capable of justifying public authorities having access to a set of traffic or location data, that are liable to provide information regarding the communications made by a user of a means of electronic communication or regarding the location of the terminal equipment which he or she uses and that allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraph\u00a054), and other factors relating to the proportionality of a request for access, such as the length of the period in respect of which access to such data is sought, cannot have the effect that the objective of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences in general is capable of justifying such access.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Access to a set of traffic or location data, such as the data retained pursuant to Paragraph 1111 of the Law on electronic communications, is indeed liable to allow precise, or even very precise, conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data has been retained, such as the habits of everyday life, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social relationships of those persons and the social environments frequented by them (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0117).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, as the referring court suggests, the longer that the period is in respect of which access is sought, the greater, in principle, is the quantity of data liable to be retained by providers of electronic communications services, regarding the electronic communications sent, the places of residence stayed in and the movements made by the user of a means of electronic communication, thus allowing a greater number of conclusions concerning that user\u2019s private life to be drawn from the data consulted. A similar finding may be made so far as concerns the categories of data sought.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is, therefore, for the purpose of satisfying the requirement of proportionality, under which derogations from and limitations on the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0130 and the case-law cited), that it is for the competent national authorities to ensure, in each individual case, that both the category or categories of data covered and the period in respect of which access to those data is sought are, on the basis of the circumstances of the case, limited to what is strictly necessary for the purposes of the investigation in question.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter that is entailed by a public authority\u2019s access to a set of traffic or location data, that are liable to provide information regarding the communications made by a user of a means of electronic communication or regarding the location of the terminal equipment which he or she uses, is in any event serious regardless of the length of the period in respect of which access to those data is sought and the quantity or nature of the data available in respect of such a period, when, as in the main proceedings, that set of data is liable to allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private life of the person or persons concerned.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even access to a limited quantity of traffic or location data or access to data in respect of a short period may be liable to provide precise information on the private life of a user of a means of electronic communication. Furthermore, the quantity of the data available and the specific information on the private life of the person concerned that results from the data are matters that can be assessed only after the data have been consulted. However, authorisation of access, granted by the court having jurisdiction or the competent independent authority, necessarily occurs before the data and the information resulting therefrom can be consulted. Thus, the assessment of the seriousness of the interference that the access constitutes is necessarily carried out on the basis of the risk generally pertaining to the category of data sought for the private lives of the persons concerned, without it indeed mattering whether or not the resulting information relating to the person\u2019s private life is in actual fact sensitive.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, given the fact that the referring court has before it a claim that the reports drawn up on the basis of the traffic and location data are inadmissible, on the ground that Paragraph 1111 of the Law on electronic communications is contrary to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 as regards both retention of and access to data, it should be noted that, as EU law currently stands, it is, in principle, for national law alone to determine the rules relating to the admissibility and assessment, in criminal proceedings against persons suspected of having committed criminal offences, of information and evidence obtained by general and indiscriminate retention of such data contrary to EU law (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0222) or by access of the national authorities thereto contrary to EU law.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has consistently held that, in the absence of EU rules on the matter, it is for the national legal order of each Member State, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy, to establish procedural rules for actions intended to safeguard the rights that individuals derive from EU law, provided, however, that those rules are no less favourable than the rules governing similar situations subject to domestic law (the principle of equivalence) and do not render impossible in practice or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by EU law (the principle of effectiveness) (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0223 and the case-law cited).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the principle of effectiveness in particular, it should be noted that the objective of national rules on the admissibility and use of information and evidence is, in accordance with the choices made by national law, to prevent information and evidence obtained unlawfully from unduly prejudicing a person who is suspected of having committed criminal offences. That objective may be achieved under national law not only by prohibiting the use of such information and evidence, but also by means of national rules and practices governing the assessment and weighting of such material, or by factoring in whether that material is unlawful when determining the sentence (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0225).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In deciding whether to exclude information and evidence obtained in contravention of the requirements of EU law, regard must be had, in particular, to the risk of breach of the adversarial principle and, therefore, of the right to a fair trial entailed by the admissibility of such information and evidence. If a court takes the view that a party is not in a position to comment effectively on evidence pertaining to a field of which the judges have no knowledge and that is likely to have a preponderant influence on the findings of fact, it must find an infringement of the right to a fair trial and exclude that evidence in order to avoid such an infringement. Therefore, the principle of effectiveness requires national criminal courts to disregard information and evidence obtained by means of the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data in breach of EU law or by means of access of the competent authority thereto in breach of EU law, in the context of criminal proceedings against persons suspected of having committed criminal offences, where those persons are not in a position to comment effectively on that information and that evidence and they pertain to a field of which the judges have no knowledge and are likely to have a preponderant influence on the findings of fact (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0226 and 227).\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first and second questions is that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that permits public authorities to have access to a set of traffic or location data, that are liable to provide information regarding the communications made by a user of a means of electronic communication or regarding the location of the terminal equipment which he or she uses and to allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning his or her private life, for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, without such access being confined to procedures and proceedings to combat serious crime or prevent serious threats to public security, and that is so regardless of the length of the period in respect of which access to those data is sought and the quantity or nature of the data available in respect of such a period.\n\u00a0\nT\nhe t\nhird\n question\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that confers upon the public prosecutor\u2019s office, whose task is to direct the criminal pre-trial procedure and to bring, where appropriate, the public prosecution in subsequent proceedings, the power to authorise access of a public authority to traffic and location data for the purposes of a criminal investigation.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court explains in this connection that, whilst the Estonian public prosecutor\u2019s office is, under national law, obliged to act independently, is subject only to the law and must examine the incriminating and exculpatory evidence in the pre-trial procedure, the objective of that procedure nevertheless remains the gathering of evidence and fulfilment of the other conditions necessary for judicial proceedings. It states that it is that authority which represents the public prosecution at the trial and it is therefore also party to the proceedings. Furthermore, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that, as the Estonian Government and the Prokuratuur also confirmed at the hearing, the Estonian public prosecutor\u2019s office is organised hierarchically and that requests for access to traffic and location data are not subject to particular formal requirements and may be made by the public prosecutor him or herself. Finally, the persons to whose data access may be granted are not only those suspected of involvement in a criminal offence.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, as the Court has already held, it is for national law to determine the conditions under which providers of electronic communications services must grant the competent national authorities access to the data in their possession. However, in order to satisfy the requirement of proportionality, such legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose personal data are affected have sufficient guarantees that data will be effectively protected against the risk of abuse. That legislation must be legally binding under domestic law and must indicate in what circumstances and under which conditions a measure providing for the processing of such data may be adopted, thereby ensuring that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary (see, to that effect, judgments of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraphs\u00a0117 and 118; of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nPrivacy International\n, C-623/17, EU:C:2020:790, paragraph\u00a068; and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0132 and the case-law cited).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, national legislation governing the access of the competent authorities to retained traffic and location data, adopted pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, cannot be limited to requiring that the authorities\u2019 access to the data be consistent with the objective pursued by that legislation, but must also lay down the substantive and procedural conditions governing that use (judgments of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nPrivacy International\n, C-623/17, EU:C:2020:790, paragraph\u00a077, and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0176 and the case-law cited).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, and since general access to all retained data, regardless of whether there is any, at least indirect, link with the intended purpose, cannot be regarded as being limited to what is strictly necessary, the national legislation concerned must be based on objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which the competent national authorities are to be granted access to the data in question. In that regard, such access can, as a general rule, be granted, in relation to the objective of fighting crime, only to the data of individuals suspected of planning, committing or having committed a serious crime or of being implicated in one way or another in such a crime. However, in particular situations, where for example vital national security, defence or public security interests are threatened by terrorist activities, access to the data of other persons might also be granted where there is objective evidence from which it can be deduced that that data might, in a specific case, make an effective contribution to combating such activities (see, to that effect, judgments of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0119, and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0188).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure, in practice, that those conditions are fully observed, it is essential that access of the competent national authorities to retained data be subject to a prior review carried out either by a court or by an independent administrative body, and that the decision of that court or body be made following a reasoned request by those authorities submitted, inter alia, within the framework of procedures for the prevention, detection or prosecution of crime. In cases of duly justified urgency, the review must take place within a short time (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0189 and the case-law cited).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General has observed, in essence, in point\u00a0105 of his Opinion, one of the requirements for that prior review is that the court or body entrusted with carrying it out must have all the powers and provide all the guarantees necessary in order to reconcile the various interests and rights at issue. As regards a criminal investigation in particular, it is a requirement of such a review that that court or body must be able to strike a fair balance between, on the one hand, the interests relating to the needs of the investigation in the context of combating crime and, on the other, the fundamental rights to privacy and protection of personal data of the persons whose data are concerned by the access.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where that review is carried out not by a court but by an independent administrative body, that body must have a status enabling it to act objectively and impartially when carrying out its duties and must, for that purpose, be free from any external influence (see, to that effect, judgment of 9\u00a0March 2010, \nCommission\n v \nGermany\n, C-518/07, EU:C:2010:125, paragraph\u00a025, and Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0229 and 230).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing considerations that the requirement of independence that has to be satisfied by the authority entrusted with carrying out the prior review referred to in paragraph\u00a051 of the present judgment means that that authority must be a third party in relation to the authority which requests access to the data, in order that the former is able to carry out the review objectively and impartially and free from any external influence. In particular, in the criminal field, as the Advocate General has observed, in essence, in point\u00a0126 of his Opinion, the requirement of independence entails that the authority entrusted with the prior review, first, must not be involved in the conduct of the criminal investigation in question and, second, has a neutral stance vis-\u00e0-vis the parties to the criminal proceedings.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is not so in the case of a public prosecutor\u2019s office which directs the investigation procedure and, where appropriate, brings the public prosecution. The public prosecutor\u2019s office has the task not of ruling on a case in complete independence but, acting as prosecutor in the proceedings, of putting it, where appropriate, before the court that has jurisdiction.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that the public prosecutor\u2019s office may, in accordance with the rules governing its powers and status, be required to verify the incriminating and exculpatory evidence, to guarantee the lawfulness of the pre-trial procedure and to act exclusively according to the law and the prosecutor\u2019s convictions cannot be sufficient to confer upon it the status of a third party in relation to the interests at issue as referred to in paragraph\u00a052 of the present judgment.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the public prosecutor\u2019s office is not in a position to carry out the prior review referred to in paragraph\u00a051 of the present judgment.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the referring court has raised, furthermore, the issue whether the lack of a review by an independent authority may be made up for by a subsequent review carried out by a court as to whether a national authority\u2019s access to traffic and location data was lawful, it must be pointed out that, as required by the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a051 of the present judgment, the independent review must take place before any access, except in the event of duly justified urgency, in which case the review must take place within a short time. As the Advocate General has stated in point\u00a0128 of his Opinion, such subsequent review would not enable the objective of a prior review, consisting in preventing the authorisation of access to the data in question that exceeds what is strictly necessary, to be met.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the answer to the third question referred for a preliminary ruling is that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that confers upon the public prosecutor\u2019s office, whose task is to direct the criminal pre-trial procedure and to bring, where appropriate, the public prosecution in subsequent proceedings, the power to authorise access of a public authority to traffic and location data for the purposes of a criminal investigation.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that permits public authorities to have access to a set of traffic or location data, that are liable to provide information regarding the communications made by a user of a means of electronic communication or regarding the location of the terminal equipment which he or she uses and to allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning his or her private life, for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, without such access being confined to procedures and proceedings to combat serious crime or prevent serious threats to public security, and that is so regardless of the length of the period in respect of which access to those data is sought and the quantity or nature of the data available in respect of such a period.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, as amended by Directive 2009/136, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that confers upon the public prosecutor\u2019s office, whose task is to direct the criminal pre-trial procedure and to bring, where appropriate, the public prosecution in subsequent proceedings, the power to authorise access of a public authority to traffic and location data for the purposes of a criminal investigation."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law.\u00a0\u2026\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union.\u00a0\u2026\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States.\n\u2026\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information[,] should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person.\u00a0\u2026 The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes.\n\u2026\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The responsibility and liability of the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on the controller\u2019s behalf should be established. In particular, the controller should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.\n\u2026\n(79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects as well as the responsibility and liability of controllers and processors\u00a0\u2026 requires a clear allocation of the responsibilities under this Regulation, including where a controller determines the purposes and means of the processing jointly with other controllers or where a processing operation is carried out on behalf of a controller.\n\u2026\n(129)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure consistent monitoring and enforcement of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory authorities should have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers, including powers of investigation, corrective powers and sanctions\u00a0\u2026 The powers of supervisory authorities should be exercised in accordance with appropriate procedural safeguards set out in Union and Member State law, impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time. In particular[,] each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate in view of ensuring compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the circumstances of each individual case, respect the right of every person to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons concerned. Investigatory powers as regards access to premises should be exercised in accordance with specific requirements in Member State procedural law, such as the requirement to obtain a prior judicial authorisation. Each legally binding measure of the supervisory authority should be in writing, be clear and unambiguous, indicate the supervisory authority which has issued the measure, the date of issue of the measure, bear the signature of the head, or a member of the supervisory authority authorised by him or her, give the reasons for the measure, and refer to the right of an effective remedy. This should not preclude additional requirements pursuant to Member State procedural law. The adoption of a legally binding decision implies that it may give rise to judicial review in the Member State of the supervisory authority that adopted the decision.\n\u2026\n(148)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to strengthen the enforcement of the rules of this Regulation, penalties including administrative fines should be imposed for any infringement of this Regulation, in addition to, or instead of[,] appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority pursuant to this Regulation. In a case of a minor infringement or if the fine likely to be imposed would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person, a reprimand may be issued instead of a fine. Due regard should however be given to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, the intentional character of the infringement, actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility or any relevant previous infringements, the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority, compliance with measures ordered against the controller or processor, adherence to a code of conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating factor. The imposition of penalties including administrative fines should be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with the general principles of Union law and the [Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union], including effective judicial protection and due process.\u2019\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Article\u00a04 of that regulation:\n\u2018For the purposes of this Regulation:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cpersonal data\u201d means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cprocessing\u201d means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\n\u2026\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cpseudonymisation\u201d means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person;\n\u2026\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201ccontroller\u201d means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cprocessor\u201d means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;\n\u2026\u2019\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a026 of the GDPR, entitled \u2018Joint controllers\u2019, states, in paragraph\u00a01 thereof:\n\u2018Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they shall be joint controllers.

A.S. subsequently sent emails to the company ITSS relating to various aspects of the creation of that application, and a copy of those emails was sent to the Director of the NVSC.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the course of the negotiations between the company ITSS and the NVSC, in addition to A.S., other employees of the NVSC also sent emails to that company concerning the drafting of the questions asked in the mobile application at issue.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the creation of that mobile application, a confidentiality policy was drawn up, in which the company ITSS and the NVSC were designated as controllers.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mobile application at issue, which referred to the company ITSS and the NVSC, was available for download in the online shop Google Play Store as from 4\u00a0April 2020 and in the online shop Apple App Store as from 6\u00a0April 2020. It was operational until 26\u00a0May 2020.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 4\u00a0April 2020 to 26\u00a0May 2020, 3\u00a0802 persons used that application and provided data relating to them as requested by the application, such as their ID number, geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), country, city, municipality, postcode, street name, building number, surname, first name, personal identification number, telephone number and address.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By a further decision of 10\u00a0April 2020, the Minister for Health of the Republic of Lithuania decided to entrust the Director of the NVSC with the task of organising the acquisition of the mobile application at issue from the company ITSS and, for that purpose, it was envisaged that recourse would be had to Article\u00a072(2) of the Law on Public Procurement. However, no public contract for the official acquisition of that application by the NVSC was awarded to that company.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 15\u00a0May 2020, the NVSC asked the company ITSS not to make any reference whatsoever to the NVSC in the mobile application at issue. Furthermore, by letter of 4\u00a0June 2020, the NVSC informed that company that, due to a lack of funding for the acquisition of that application, it had, in accordance with Article\u00a029(3) of the Law on Public Procurement, terminated the procedure relating to such acquisition.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the context of an investigation relating to the processing of personal data, initiated on 18\u00a0May 2020, the VDAI established that personal data had been collected using the mobile application at issue. Moreover, it was found that the users who had chosen that application as a means of monitoring the isolation made mandatory on account of the COVID-19 pandemic had replied to questions involving the processing of personal data. Those data had allegedly been provided in the replies to the questions asked by the abovementioned application and related, inter alia, to the health status of the data subject and to his or her compliance with the conditions of isolation.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 24\u00a0February 2021, the VDAI imposed an administrative fine of EUR\u00a012\u00a0000 on the NVSC pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the GDPR, in view of the infringement by the NVSC of Articles\u00a05, 13, 24, 32 and 35 of that regulation. By that decision, an administrative fine of EUR\u00a03\u00a0000 was also imposed on the company ITSS as joint controller.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The NVSC has challenged that decision before the Vilniaus apygardos administracinis teismas (Regional Administrative Court, Vilnius, Lithuania), which is the referring court, maintaining that it is the company ITSS which must be regarded as the sole controller, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR. The company ITSS, for its part, contends that it acted in the capacity of processor, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(8) of the GDPR, on the instruction of the NVSC which, according to that company, is the sole controller.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court notes that the company ITSS created the mobile application at issue and that the NVSC provided that company with advice regarding the content of the questions asked by that application. It observes that there is, however, no public contract between the NVSC and the company ITSS. In addition, it notes that the NVSC neither consented to nor authorised that application being made available through various online shops.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states that the creation of the mobile application at issue was intended to implement the objective assigned by the NVSC, namely the management of the COVID-19 pandemic through the creation of an IT tool, and that the processing of personal data was envisaged for that purpose. As regards the role of the company ITSS, it notes that it was not envisaged that that company would pursue objectives other than that of receiving remuneration for the IT product created.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court also observes that, during the VDAI investigation, it was established that the Lithuanian company Juvare Lithuania, which manages the IT system for monitoring and controlling transmissible diseases that pose a risk of contagion, had to receive copies of the personal data collected by the mobile application at issue. Furthermore, for the purpose of testing that application, fictitious data were used, with the exception of the telephone numbers of that company\u2019s employees.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Vilniaus apygardos administracinis teismas (Regional Administrative Court, Vilnius) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can the concept of \u201ccontroller\u201d set out in Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR be interpreted as meaning that a person who is planning to acquire a data collection tool (mobile application) by way of public procurement, irrespective of the fact that a public procurement contract has not been concluded and that the created product (mobile application), for the acquisition of which a public procurement procedure had been used, has not been transferred, is also to be regarded as a controller?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can the concept of \u201ccontroller\u201d set out in Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR be interpreted as meaning that a contracting authority which has not acquired the right of ownership of the created IT product and has not taken possession of it, but where the final version of the created application provides links or interfaces to that public entity and/or [where] the confidentiality policy, which was not officially approved or recognised by the public entity in question, specified that public entity itself as a controller, is also to be regarded as a controller?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can the concept of \u201ccontroller\u201d set out in Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR be interpreted as meaning that a person who has not performed any actual data processing operations as defined in Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR and/or has not provided clear permission/consent to the performance of such operations is also to be regarded as a controller? Is the fact that the IT product used for the processing of personal data was created in accordance with the assignment formulated by the contracting authority significant for the interpretation of the concept of \u201ccontroller\u201d?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the determination of actual data processing operations is relevant for the interpretation of the concept of \u201ccontroller\u201d, is the definition of \u201cprocessing\u201d of personal data under Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR to be interpreted as also covering situations in which copies of personal data have been used for the testing of IT systems in the process for the acquisition of a mobile application?\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can joint control of data in accordance with Article\u00a04(7) and Article\u00a026(1) of the GDPR be interpreted exclusively as involving deliberately coordinated actions in respect of the determination of the purpose and means of data processing, or can that concept also be interpreted as meaning that joint control also covers situations in which there is no clear \u201carrangement\u201d in respect of the purpose and means of data processing and/or actions are not coordinated between the entities? Are the circumstance relating to the stage in the creation of the means of personal data processing (IT application) at which personal data were processed and the purpose of the creation of the application legally significant for the interpretation of the concept of joint control of data? Can an \u201carrangement\u201d between joint controllers be understood exclusively as a clear and defined establishment of terms governing the joint control of data?\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the provision in Article\u00a083(1) of the GDPR to the effect that \u201cadministrative fines\u00a0\u2026 shall\u00a0\u2026 be effective, proportionate and dissuasive\u201d to be interpreted as also covering cases of imposition of liability on the \u201ccontroller\u201d when, in the process of the creation of an IT product, the developer also performs personal data processing actions, and do the improper personal data processing actions carried out by the processor always give rise automatically to legal liability on the part of the controller? Is that provision to be interpreted as also covering cases of no-fault liability on the part of the controller?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first, second and third questions\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first, second and third questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR is to be interpreted as meaning that an entity which has entrusted an undertaking with the development of a mobile IT application may be regarded as a controller, within the meaning of that provision, although that entity has not itself performed any personal data processing operations, has not expressly agreed to the performance of specific operations for such processing or to that mobile application being made available to the public, and has not acquired the abovementioned mobile application.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR defines the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 broadly as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which, alone or jointly with others, \u2018determines the purposes and means of the processing\u2019 of personal data.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The objective of that broad definition consists, in accordance with the objective pursued by the GDPR, in ensuring effective protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, in ensuring a high level of protection of the right of every person to the protection of personal data concerning him or her (see, to that effect, judgments of 29\u00a0July 2019, \nFashion ID\n, C-40/17, EU:C:2019:629, paragraph\u00a066, and of 28\u00a0April 2022, \nMeta Platforms Ireland\n, C-319/20, EU:C:2022:322, paragraph\u00a073 and the case-law cited).\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already held that any natural or legal person who exerts influence over the processing of such data, for his, her or its own purposes, and who participates, as a result, in the determination of the purposes and means of that processing, may be regarded as a controller in respect of such processing. In that regard, it is not necessary that the purposes and means of processing be determined by the use of written guidelines or instructions from the controller (see, to that effect, judgment of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraphs\u00a067 and 68); nor is it necessary for that controller to have been formally designated as such.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in order to establish whether an entity such as the NVSC may be regarded as a controller within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR, it is necessary to examine whether that entity actually exerted influence, for its own purposes, over the determination of the purposes and means of the processing in question.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, subject to matters to be determined by the referring court, it is apparent from the file before the Court of Justice that the creation of the mobile application at issue was commissioned by the NVSC and was intended to implement the objective assigned by that entity, namely the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by means of an IT tool for registering and monitoring the data of persons exposed to the COVID-19 virus. For that purpose, the NVSC had envisaged that the personal data of users of the mobile application at issue would be processed. Furthermore, it is apparent from the order for reference that the parameters of that application, such as the questions asked and their wording, were adapted to the needs of the NVSC and that that entity played an active role in their determination.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it must, in principle, be considered that the NVSC actually participated in the determination of the purposes and means of the processing.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, the mere fact that the NVSC was referred to as a controller in the confidentiality policy of the mobile application at issue and that links to that entity were included in that application could be regarded as relevant only if it were established that the NVSC consented, either expressly or implicitly, to such reference or links.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the circumstances stated by the referring court in the considerations provided in support of its first three questions referred for a preliminary ruling\u00a0\u2013 namely that the NVSC did not itself process any personal data, that there was no contract between the NVSC and the company ITSS, that the NVSC did not acquire the mobile application at issue and that the dissemination of that application through online shops was not authorised by the NVSC\u00a0\u2013 do not preclude the NVSC from being classified as a \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, it is apparent from that provision, read in the light of recital\u00a074 of the GDPR, that an entity, provided that it satisfies the condition laid down by Article\u00a04(7) of that regulation, is responsible and liable not only for any processing of personal data which it itself carries out, but also for any such processing carried out on its behalf.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, however, it must be stated that the NVSC cannot be regarded as the controller of personal data processing resulting from the mobile application at issue being made available to the public if, prior to that application being made available, the NVSC expressly objected to such making available, which is a matter for the referring court to ascertain. In such a situation, it cannot be considered that the processing in question was carried out on behalf of the NVSC.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the first, second and third questions is that Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that an entity which has entrusted an undertaking with the development of a mobile IT application and which has, in that context, participated in the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of personal data carried out through that application may be regarded as a controller, within the meaning of that provision, even if that entity has not itself performed any processing operations in respect of such data, has not expressly agreed to the performance of specific operations for such processing or to that mobile application being made available to the public, and has not acquired the abovementioned mobile application, unless, prior to that application being made available to the public, that entity expressly objected to such making available and to the resulting processing of personal data.\n\u00a0\nThe fifth question\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fifth question, which it is appropriate to examine in the second place, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a04(7) and Article\u00a026(1) of the GDPR are to be interpreted as meaning that the classification of two entities as joint controllers requires that there be an arrangement between those entities regarding the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of personal data in question or that there be an arrangement laying down the terms of the joint control.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a026(1) of the GDPR, \u2018joint controllers\u2019 exist where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has held, in order to be regarded as a joint controller, a natural or legal person therefore must independently meet the definition of \u2018controller\u2019 laid down in Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0July 2019, \nFashion ID\n, C-40/17, EU:C:2019:629, paragraph\u00a074).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the existence of joint responsibility does not necessarily imply equal responsibility of the various operators involved in the processing of personal data. On the contrary, those operators may be involved at different stages of that processing of personal data and to different degrees, so that the level of responsibility of each of them must be assessed with regard to all the relevant circumstances of the particular case (judgment of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraph\u00a043). Furthermore, the joint responsibility of several actors for the same processing does not require each of them to have access to the personal data concerned (judgment of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a069 and the case-law cited).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a038 of his Opinion, participation in the determination of the purposes and means of processing can take different forms, since such participation can result from a common decision taken by two or more entities or from converging decisions of those entities. However, where the latter is the case, those decisions must complement each other in such a manner that they each have a tangible impact on the determination of the purposes and means of the processing.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, it cannot be required that there be a formal arrangement between those controllers as regards the purposes and means of processing.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, by virtue of Article\u00a026(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital\u00a079 of that regulation, joint controllers must, by means of an arrangement between them, determine in a transparent manner their respective responsibilities for compliance with the obligations under that regulation. However, the existence of such an arrangement constitutes not a precondition for two or more entities to be classified as joint controllers, but rather an obligation which Article\u00a026(1) of the GDPR imposes on joint controllers, once they have been classified as such, for the purposes of compliance with their obligations under that regulation. Thus, such classification arises solely from the fact that several entities have participated in the determination of the purposes and means of processing.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the fifth question is that Article\u00a04(7) and Article\u00a026(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the classification of two entities as joint controllers does not require that there be an arrangement between those entities regarding the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of personal data in question; nor does it require that there be an arrangement laying down the terms of the joint control.\n\u00a0\nThe fourth question\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR is to be interpreted as meaning that the use of personal data for the purposes of the IT testing of a mobile application constitutes \u2018processing\u2019 within the meaning of that provision.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, as is apparent from paragraph\u00a025 of the present judgment, the Lithuanian company which manages the IT system for monitoring and controlling transmissible diseases that pose a risk of contagion had to receive copies of the personal data collected by the mobile application at issue. For IT testing purposes, fictitious data were used, with the exception of the telephone numbers of that company\u2019s employees.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in the first place, Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR defines the concept of \u2018processing\u2019 as \u2018any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means\u2019. In a non-exhaustive list, beginning with the wording \u2018such as\u2019, that provision refers to the collection, making available and use of personal data as examples of processing.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is therefore apparent from the wording of that provision, and in particular from the expression \u2018any operation\u2019, that the EU legislature intended to confer a broad scope upon the concept of \u2018processing\u2019 (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0February 2022, \nValsts ie\u0146\u0113mumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)\n, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraph\u00a035), and that the reasons for which an operation or set of operations is performed cannot be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether that operation or set of operations constitutes \u2018processing\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the question whether personal data are used for the purposes of IT testing or for another purpose has no bearing on whether the operation in question is classified as \u2018processing\u2019 within the meaning of that provision.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, however, it should be pointed out that only processing which relates to \u2018personal data\u2019 constitutes \u2018processing\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Article\u00a04(1) of that regulation states that \u2018personal data\u2019 must be understood as meaning \u2018any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019, that is to say, relating to a \u2018natural person\u00a0\u2026 who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person\u2019.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact, alluded to by the referring court in its fourth question, that \u2018copies of personal data\u2019 are involved does not, in itself, preclude such copies from being classified as personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR, provided that those copies actually contain information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it must be stated that fictitious data, where they relate not to an identified or identifiable natural person but rather to a person who does not actually exist, do not constitute personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same applies with regard to data used for the purposes of IT testing which are anonymous or have been rendered anonymous.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from recital\u00a026 of the GDPR and from the very definition of the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 provided in Article\u00a04(1) of that regulation that neither \u2018anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019, nor \u2018personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable\u2019, is covered by that concept.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, it follows from Article\u00a04(5) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with recital\u00a026 of that regulation, that personal data which have undergone only pseudonymisation and which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information must be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person, to which the principles of data protection apply.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the fourth question is that Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the use of personal data for the purposes of the IT testing of a mobile application constitutes \u2018processing\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, unless such data have been rendered anonymous in such a manner that the subject of those data is not or is no longer identifiable, or unless it involves fictitious data which do not relate to an existing natural person.\n\u00a0\nThe sixth question\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its sixth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a083 of the GDPR is to be interpreted as meaning that (i) an administrative fine may be imposed pursuant to that provision only where it is established that the controller has intentionally or negligently committed an infringement referred to in paragraphs\u00a04 to 6 of that article, and (ii) such a fine may be imposed on a controller in respect of processing operations performed by a processor on behalf of that controller.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the first place, the question whether an administrative fine may be imposed pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the GDPR only in so far as it is established that the controller or processor has intentionally or negligently committed an infringement referred to in paragraphs\u00a04 to 6 of that article, it is apparent from paragraph\u00a01 thereof that such fines must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. On the other hand, Article\u00a083 of the GDPR does not expressly state that such an infringement may not be penalised by means of such a fine unless it was committed intentionally or, at the very least, negligently.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Lithuanian Government and the Council of the European Union infer from this that the EU legislature intended to leave the Member States a certain margin of discretion in the implementation of Article\u00a083 of the GDPR, allowing them to provide for the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to that provision, if necessary, without it being established that the infringement of the GDPR penalised by means of such a fine was committed intentionally or negligently.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such an interpretation of Article\u00a083 of the GDPR cannot be adopted.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that, pursuant to Article\u00a0288 TFEU, the provisions of regulations generally have immediate effect in the national legal systems without it being necessary for the national authorities to adopt measures of application. Nonetheless, some provisions of regulations may necessitate, for their implementation, the adoption of measures of application by the Member States (see, to that effect, judgment of 28\u00a0April 2022, \nMeta Platforms Ireland\n, C-319/20, EU:C:2022:322, paragraph\u00a058 and the case-law cited).\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is particularly the case for the GDPR, certain provisions of which make it possible for Member States to lay down additional, stricter or derogating national rules, which leave them a margin of discretion as to the manner in which those provisions may be implemented (judgment of 28\u00a0April 2022, \nMeta Platforms Ireland\n, C-319/20, EU:C:2022:322, paragraph\u00a057).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, in the absence of specific procedural rules in the GDPR, it is for the legal system of each Member State, subject to compliance with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness, to prescribe the detailed rules governing actions for safeguarding rights which individuals derive from the provisions of that regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Non-material damage in connection with the processing of personal data)\n, C-300/21, EU:C:2023:370, paragraphs\u00a053 and 54 and the case-law cited).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, there is nothing in the wording of Article\u00a083(1) to (6) of the GDPR to suggest that the EU legislature intended to leave the Member States a margin of discretion as regards the substantive conditions which must be satisfied by a supervisory authority where that authority decides to impose an administrative fine on a controller in respect of an infringement referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) of that regulation.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that Article\u00a083(7) of the GDPR provides that each Member State may lay down the rules on whether and to what extent administrative fines may be imposed on public authorities and bodies established in that Member State. Moreover, it is clear from Article\u00a083(8) of that regulation, read in the light of recital\u00a0129 thereof, that the exercise by the supervisory authority of its powers under that article is to be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with Union and Member State law, including effective judicial remedy and due process.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the fact that the GDPR thereby grants Member States the possibility to lay down exceptions in relation to public authorities and bodies established in those Member States and requirements concerning the procedure to be followed by supervisory authorities in order to impose an administrative fine in no way means that those States are also authorised to lay down, in addition to such exceptions and procedural requirements, substantive conditions which must be satisfied in order to render the controller liable and impose an administrative fine on it pursuant to Article\u00a083 of that regulation. In addition, the fact that the EU legislature took care to make express provision for that possibility but not the possibility to lay down such substantive conditions confirms that it did not leave the Member States a margin of discretion in that regard.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion is also borne out by a combined reading of Articles\u00a083 and 84 of the GDPR. Article\u00a084(1) of that regulation recognises that Member States retain the power to lay down the rules on \u2018other penalties applicable\u2019 to infringements of that regulation, \u2018in particular for infringements which are not subject to administrative fines pursuant to Article\u00a083\u2019. It thus follows from such a combined reading of those provisions that the determination of substantive conditions for imposing such administrative fines falls outside the scope of that power. Consequently, such conditions are governed solely by EU law.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the abovementioned conditions, it should be noted that Article\u00a083(2) of the GDPR lists the factors in the light of which the supervisory authority may impose an administrative fine on the controller. Those factors include, in point (b) of that provision, \u2018the intentional or negligent character of the infringement\u2019. By contrast, none of the factors listed in the abovementioned provision refers to any possibility of rendering the controller liable in the absence of wrongful conduct on its part.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, paragraph\u00a02 of Article\u00a083 of the GDPR must be read in conjunction with paragraph\u00a03 of that article, the purpose of which is to provide for consequences in cases involving multiple infringements of that regulation and according to which \u2018if a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked processing operations, infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement\u2019.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It thus follows from the wording of Article\u00a083(2) of the GDPR that only infringements of the provisions of that regulation which are committed wrongfully by the controller, that is to say, those committed intentionally or negligently, may result in an administrative fine being imposed on that controller pursuant to that article.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The general scheme and purpose of the GDPR support such a reading.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the EU legislature provided for a system of sanctions allowing supervisory authorities to impose the most appropriate penalties depending on the circumstances of each individual case.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a058 of the GDPR, which determines the powers of supervisory authorities, provides, in paragraph\u00a02(i) thereof, that those authorities may impose administrative fines pursuant to Article\u00a083 of that regulation, \u2018in addition to, or instead of\u2019, the other corrective measures listed in Article\u00a058(2) of the GDPR, such as warnings, reprimands or orders. Similarly, recital\u00a0148 of that regulation states, inter alia, that, in a case of a minor infringement or if the administrative fine likely to be imposed would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person, supervisory authorities may refrain from imposing an administrative fine and instead issue a reprimand.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, it is apparent, in particular, from recital\u00a010 of the GDPR that the objectives of the provisions of that regulation are, inter alia, to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data within the Union and, to that end, to ensure consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data throughout the Union. In addition, recitals\u00a011 and 129 of the GDPR emphasise the need to ensure, for the purpose of guaranteeing the consistent application of that regulation, that the supervisory authorities have equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and that they can impose equivalent sanctions in the event of infringements of that regulation.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The existence of a system of sanctions, which allows an administrative fine to be imposed pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the GDPR where justified by the specific circumstances of each individual case, provides an incentive for controllers and processors to comply with that regulation. Through their dissuasive effect, administrative fines contribute to strengthening the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and are therefore a key element in ensuring respect for the rights of those persons, in accordance with the purpose of that regulation, which is to ensure a high level of protection for such persons with regard to the processing of personal data.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the EU legislature did not deem it necessary, for the purpose of ensuring such a high level of protection, to provide for the imposition of administrative fines in the absence of fault. Having regard to the fact that the GDPR aims to achieve a level of protection which is both equivalent and homogenous, and that, to that end, it must be applied consistently throughout the Union, it would be contrary to that purpose to allow the Member States to lay down such a regime for imposing a fine pursuant to Article\u00a083 of that regulation. Moreover, such freedom of choice would be liable to distort competition between economic operators within the Union, which would run counter to the objectives set out by the EU legislature in, inter alia, recitals\u00a09 and 13 of that regulation.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it must be found that Article\u00a083 of the GDPR does not allow an administrative fine to be imposed in respect of an infringement referred to in paragraphs\u00a04 to 6 of that article without it being established that such an infringement was committed intentionally or negligently by the controller, and that, accordingly, a wrongful infringement constitutes a condition for imposing such a fine.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must also be stated, in relation to the question whether an infringement has been committed intentionally or negligently and is therefore liable to be penalised by way of an administrative fine under Article\u00a083 of the GDPR, that a controller may be penalised for conduct falling within the scope of the GDPR where that controller could not have been unaware of the infringing nature of its conduct, whether or not it was aware that it was infringing the provisions of the GDPR (see, by analogy, judgments of 18\u00a0June 2013, \nSchenker & Co. and Others\n, C-681/11, EU:C:2013:404, paragraph\u00a037 and the case-law cited; of 25\u00a0March 2021, \nLundbeck \nv\n Commission\n, C-591/16\u00a0P, EU:C:2021:243, paragraph\u00a0156; and of 25\u00a0March 2021, \nArrow Group and Arrow Generics \nv\n Commission\n, C-601/16\u00a0P, EU:C:2021:244, paragraph\u00a097).\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the controller is a legal person, it must also be stated that, for Article\u00a083 of the GDPR to apply, it is not necessary for there to have been action by, or even knowledge on the part of, the management body of that legal person (see, by analogy, judgments of 7\u00a0June 1983, \nMusique diffusion fran\u00e7aise and Others \nv\n Commission\n, 100/80 to 103/80, EU:C:1983:158, paragraph\u00a097, and of 16\u00a0February 2017, \nTudapetrol Mineral\u00f6lerzeugnisse Nils Hansen \nv\n Commission\n, C-94/15\u00a0P, EU:C:2017:124, paragraph\u00a028 and the case-law cited).\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the second place, the question whether an administrative fine may be imposed pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the GDPR on a controller in respect of processing operations performed by a processor, it should be recalled that, according to the definition contained in Article\u00a04(8) of that regulation, a processor is \u2018a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller\u2019.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since, as has been stated in paragraph\u00a036 of the present judgment, a controller is responsible and liable not only for any processing of personal data which it itself carries out, but also for any such processing carried out on its behalf, that controller may have an administrative fine imposed on it pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the GDPR in a situation where personal data are unlawfully processed and where it was not such a controller, but rather a processor used by that controller, which carried out the abovementioned processing on behalf of that controller.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the responsibility and liability of the controller for the conduct of a processor cannot extend to situations where the processor has processed personal data for its own purposes or where that processor has processed such data in a manner incompatible with the framework of, or detailed arrangements for, the processing as determined by the controller, or in such a manner that it cannot reasonably be considered that that controller consented to such processing. In accordance with Article\u00a028(10) of the GDPR, the processor must, in such a situation, be considered to be a controller in respect of such processing.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the sixth question is that Article\u00a083 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that (i) an administrative fine may be imposed pursuant to that provision only where it is established that the controller has intentionally or negligently committed an infringement referred to in paragraphs\u00a04 to 6 of that article, and (ii) such a fine may be imposed on a controller in respect of personal data processing operations performed by a processor on behalf of that controller, unless, in the context of those operations, that processor has carried out processing for its own purposes or has processed such data in a manner incompatible with the framework of, or detailed arrangements for, the processing as determined by the controller, or in such a manner that it cannot reasonably be considered that that controller consented to such processing.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a04(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation),\nmust be interpreted as meaning that an entity which has entrusted an undertaking with the development of a mobile IT application and which has, in that context, participated in the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of personal data carried out through that application may be regarded as a controller, within the meaning of that provision, even if that entity has not itself performed any processing operations in respect of such data, has not expressly agreed to the performance of specific operations for such processing or to that mobile application being made available to the public, and has not acquired the abovementioned mobile application, unless, prior to that application being made available to the public, that entity expressly objected to such making available and to the resulting processing of personal data.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a04(7) and Article\u00a026(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the classification of two entities as joint controllers does not require that there be an arrangement between those entities regarding the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of personal data in question; nor does it require that there be an arrangement laying down the terms of the joint control.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a04(2) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the use of personal data for the purposes of the IT testing of a mobile application constitutes \u2018processing\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, unless such data have been rendered anonymous in such a manner that the subject of those data is not or is no longer identifiable, or unless it involves fictitious data which do not relate to an existing natural person.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a083 of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that (i) an administrative fine may be imposed pursuant to that provision only where it is established that the controller has intentionally or negligently committed an infringement referred to in paragraphs\u00a04 to 6 of that article, and (ii) such a fine may be imposed on a controller in respect of personal data processing operations performed by a processor on behalf of that controller, unless, in the context of those operations, that processor has carried out processing for its own purposes or has processed such data in a manner incompatible with the framework of, or detailed arrangements for, the processing as determined by the controller, or in such a manner that it cannot reasonably be considered that that controller consented to such processing."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The competence of the supervisory authorities should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their judicial capacity, in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in the performance of its judicial tasks, including decision-making. It should be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific bodies within the judicial system of the Member State, which should, in particular ensure compliance with the rules of this Regulation, enhance awareness among members of the judiciary of their obligations under this Regulation and handle complaints in relation to such data processing operations.\u2019\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a02 of that regulation:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Chapter\u00a02 of Title\u00a0V of the TEU;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, Regulation (EC) No\u00a045/2001 [of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18\u00a0December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (OJ 2001 L\u00a08, p.\u00a01)] applies.

Article\u00a06 of that law entrusts the AP with the task of supervising compliance with Regulation 2016/679 in the Netherlands. None of the provisions of that law reproduces the exception provided for in Article\u00a055(3) of Regulation 2016/679.\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 31\u00a0May 2018, the president of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Raad van State (Council of State), the judicial administrations of the Centrale Raad van Beroep (Netherlands) and the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven (Administrative Court of Appeal for Trade and Industry, Netherlands) adopted the regeling verwerking Persoonsgegevens bestuursrechtelijke colleges (Regulation on the processing of personal data in administrative courts). The latter act created the AVG-commissie bestuursrechtelijke colleges (Data Protection Commission for Administrative Law Tribunals, Netherlands; \u2018the GDPR Commission\u2019). The latter is responsible for advising the president of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Raad van State (Council of State), the judicial authorities of the Centrale Raad van Beroep (Higher Social Security and Civil Service Court) and the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven (Administrative Court of Appeal for Trade and Industry) on the handling of complaints relating to respect of the rights guaranteed by Regulation 2016/679.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the hearing held on 30\u00a0October 2018 before the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Raad van State (Council of State) in court proceedings in which Z was a party, represented by X, those two persons were approached by a journalist. During their conversation, X noted that that journalist had at his disposal documents from the case file concerned\u00a0\u2013 including documents that he himself had drafted\u00a0\u2013 showing his name and address in particular as well as Z\u2019s national identification number. That journalist told him that those documents had been made available to him under the right of access to the case file which the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Raad van State (Council of State) grants to journalists.\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 21\u00a0November 2018, the president of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Raad van State (Council of State) confirmed to X that that division was providing the media with a certain number of documents on pending cases. He informed him that, on the day of the hearing, the communication department of the Raad van State (Council of State) made available to the journalists present documents intended to enable them to follow hearings, namely a copy of the notice of appeal, a copy of the response and, where appropriate, a copy of the contested judicial decision, those documents being destroyed at the end of the day.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0X and Z then requested the AP to adopt with regard to the Raad van State (Council of State) \u2018enforcement measures\u2019 in respect of the rules on the protection of personal data. By their requests\u00a0\u2013 which were akin to complaints\u00a0\u2013 they claimed that, by allowing journalists to have access to personal data concerning them, originating from the documents in a court file, the Raad van State (Council of State) had infringed Regulation 2016/679.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In response to those requests, the AP stated that, pursuant to Article\u00a055(3) of Regulation 2016/679, it was not competent to supervise processing operations of the personal data concerned, carried out by the Raad van State (Council of State). It subsequently forwarded the requests of X and Z to the GDPR Commission, which in turn forwarded them to the president of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Raad van State (Council of State).\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The president of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Raad van State (Council of State) assessed the requests of X and Z as complaints relating to his letter of 21\u00a0November 2018 and, after having consulted the GDPR Commission, formulated a new policy on access to documents from court files, which was published on the website of the Raad van State (Council of State).\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0X and Z challenged, before the referring court, the Rechtbank Midden-Nederland (District Court, Central Netherlands), the decision by which the AP had found itself not competent to hear their requests.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to that court, giving a journalist access to the documents in a court file containing personal data and making them temporarily available to him or her constitutes \u2018processing\u2019 of personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of Regulation 2016/679, to which, in this case, X and Z had not consented. With a view to determining whether the AP was indeed not competent to rule on the requests of X and Z, the referring court questions, however, the interpretation that should be given to Article\u00a055(3) of that regulation, which provides that the supervisory authority is not competent to supervise processing operations of courts \u2018acting in their judicial capacity\u2019.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is against this background that the Rechtbank Midden-Nederland (District Court, Central Netherlands) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018Is Article\u00a055(3) of [Regulation 2016/679] to be interpreted as meaning that \u201cprocessing operations of courts acting in their judicial capacity\u201d can be understood to mean the provision by a judicial authority of access to procedural documents containing personal data, where such access is granted by making copies of those procedural documents available to a journalist, as described in the order for reference?\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In answering that question, is it relevant whether the national supervisory authority\u2019s supervision of that form of data processing affects independent judicial decisions in specific cases?\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In answering that question, is it relevant that, according to the judicial authority, the nature and purpose of the data processing is to inform a journalist in order to enable the journalist to better report on a public hearing in court proceedings, thereby serving the interests of openness and transparency in the administration of justice?\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In answering that question, is it relevant whether there is any express legal basis for such data processing under national law?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the question referred\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a055(3) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that a court makes temporarily available to journalists documents from court proceedings containing personal data falls within the exercise, by that court, of its \u2018judicial capacity\u2019, within the meaning of that provision. In that context, it asks whether, in order to answer that question, it is necessary to take into account the interference which the supervisory authority\u2019s exercise of its powers might have with the independence of the judges in the judgment of specific cases. It also asks whether it is necessary to take into consideration the nature and purpose of that making available of procedural documents\u00a0\u2013 to enable journalists better to report on the course of court proceedings\u00a0\u2013 or indeed whether that making available has an explicit legal basis in domestic law.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, Z submits, first, that the question referred is hypothetical and that it is, as such, inadmissible. In his view, contrary to what the request for a preliminary ruling indicates, the processing of the data concerned is a matter not for the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Raad van State (Council of State), but for the latter\u2019s communication department, which is not a court or tribunal. The request is also vitiated by several other errors or inaccuracies, in particular as regards the status of the person who approached X and Z at the end of the hearing and the exact content of the requests forwarded by the AP to the president of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Raad van State (Council of State).\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, questions relating to EU law enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court for a preliminary ruling only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the Court does not have before it the legal or factual material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it or where the problem is hypothetical (see judgment of 24\u00a0November 2020, \nOpenbaar Ministerie (Forgery of documents)\n, C-510/19, EU:C:2020:953, paragraph\u00a026 and the case-law cited).\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is more, in proceedings under Article\u00a0267 TFEU, which are based on a clear separation of functions between the national courts and the Court, the national court alone has jurisdiction to find and assess the facts in the case before it (see judgment of 26\u00a0April 2017, \nFarkas\n, C-564/15, EU:C:2017:302, paragraph\u00a037 and the case-law cited).\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling that the referring court is bound to take a position on the application of Article\u00a055(3) of Regulation 2016/679 to the making available of procedural documents containing personal data at issue in the dispute in the main proceedings to determine whether or not the review of the lawfulness of the latter fell within the AP\u2019s competence. It follows moreover from the case-law cited in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment that Z cannot rebut the presumption enjoyed by the question asked by the referring court merely by disputing the facts it mentions in its request, on which it is not for the Court to take a position. It follows that the plea of inadmissibility raised by Z must be rejected.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Z submits that Article\u00a055(3) of Regulation 2016/679 should be declared invalid by the Court on the ground that the lack of competence of the supervisory authority concerned as regards processing operations carried out by courts \u2018acting in their judicial capacity\u2019, provided for by that provision, is not coupled with the obligation for the Member States to lay down specific supervisory arrangements in respect of those processing operations, which he argues is contrary to the requirements arising from the right to an effective remedy.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, such a line of argument cannot succeed since, as is apparent from recital\u00a020 of Regulation 2016/679, the EU legislature, in enacting Article\u00a055(3) of that regulation, did not intend to shield from all supervision processing operations carried out by courts \u2018acting in their judicial capacity\u2019, but merely ruled out the entrusting of the supervision of those operations to an external authority.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer the question asked by the national court, summarised in paragraph\u00a018 above, it must first of all be noted that Article\u00a02(1) of Regulation 2016/679 provides that that regulation applies to any \u2018processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system\u2019, without any distinction being made according to the identity of the person who carried out the processing concerned. It follows that, subject to the cases mentioned in Article\u00a02(2) and (3) thereof, Regulation 2016/679 applies to processing operations carried out both by private persons and by public authorities, including, as recital\u00a020 thereof indicates, judicial authorities, such as courts.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That reading is supported by the fact that several of the provisions of Regulation 2016/679 are subject to adjustments to take account of the specificities of the processing operations carried out by courts. That is particularly the case with Article\u00a055(3) of that regulation, which excludes any competence of the supervisory authority in respect of processing operations carried out by courts \u2018acting in their judicial capacity\u2019.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulation 2016/679 can be distinguished in that regard from Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28\u00a0January 2003 on public access to environmental information and repealing Council Directive 90/313/EEC (OJ 2003 L\u00a041, p.\u00a026), which does not apply to courts and tribunals (judgment of 15\u00a0April 2021, \nFriends of the Irish Environment\n, C-470/19, EU:C:2021:271\n, \nparagraphs\u00a034\n to 40\n).\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to determine the scope of the concept of processing operations carried out by courts acting in their judicial capacity, within the meaning of Article\u00a055(3) of Regulation 2016/679, it must be recalled that the interpretation of a provision of EU law must consider not only its wording, but also the context in which it occurs and the objectives pursued by the legislation of which it is part (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nJobcenter Krefeld\n, C-181/19, EU:C:2020:794, paragraph\u00a061 and the case-law cited).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is apparent from Article\u00a055 of Regulation 2016/679 that the purpose of that article is to define competence in matters of supervision of the processing of personal data and, in particular, to delimit the competence vested in the national supervisory authority.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a055(3) of Regulation 2016/679 thus provides that processing operations carried out by courts \u2018acting in their judicial capacity\u2019 fall outside the competence of that supervisory authority.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recital\u00a020 of Regulation 2016/679, in the light of which that Article\u00a055(3) must be read, states that it should be possible to entrust supervision of processing operations carried out by the courts \u2018acting in their judicial capacity\u2019 to specific bodies within the judicial system of the Member State concerned rather than to the supervisory authority under the authority of that Member State, in order to \u2018safeguard the independence of the judiciary in the performance of its judicial tasks, including decision-making\u2019.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in points\u00a080 and 81 of his Opinion, it is apparent from the very wording of recital\u00a020 of Regulation 2016/679, and in particular from the use of the expression \u2018including\u2019, that the scope of the objective pursued by Article\u00a055(3) of that regulation, consisting in safeguarding the independence of the judiciary in the performance of its judicial tasks, cannot be confined solely to guaranteeing the independence of the judges in the adoption of a given judicial decision.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After all, safeguarding the independence of the judiciary presupposes, in general, that judicial functions are exercised wholly autonomously, without the courts being subject to any hierarchical constraint or subordinate relationship and without taking orders or instructions from any source whatsoever, thus being protected from any external intervention or pressure liable to jeopardise the independent judgment of their members and to influence their decisions. Observance of the guarantees of independence and impartiality necessary under EU law requires rules in order to dispel any reasonable doubt in the minds of individuals as to the imperviousness of the body in question to external factors and its neutrality with respect to the interests concerned (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 27\u00a0February 2018, \nAssocia\u00e7\u00e3o Sindical dos Ju\u00edzes Portugueses\n, C-64/16, EU:C:2018:117, paragraph\u00a044; of 25\u00a0July 2018, \nMinister for Justice and Equality (Deficiencies in the system of justice)\n, C-216/18\u00a0PPU, EU:C:2018:586, paragraph\u00a063; of 24\u00a0June 2019, \nCommission\n v \nPoland \n(Independence of the Supreme Court)\n, C-619/18, EU:C:2019:531, paragraph\u00a072; and of 21\u00a0December 2021, \nEuro Box Promotion and Others\n, C-357/19, C-379/19, C-547/19, C-811/19, C-840/19, EU:C:2021:1034, paragraph\u00a0225).\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the reference in Article\u00a055(3) of Regulation 2016/679 to processing operations carried out by courts \u2018acting in their judicial capacity\u2019 must be understood, in the context of that regulation, as not being limited to the processing of personal data carried out by courts in specific cases, but as referring, more broadly, to all processing operations carried out by courts in the course of their judicial activity, such that those processing operations whose supervision by the supervisory authority would be likely, whether directly or indirectly, to have an influence on the independence of their members or to weigh on their decisions are excluded from that authority\u2019s competence.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, while the nature and purpose of the processing carried out by a court relate principally to the examination of the lawfulness of that processing, they may constitute indicia that that processing falls within the exercise, by that court, of its \u2018judicial capacity\u2019.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the question whether the processing has an explicit legal basis in domestic law or whether the personal data contained therein may lawfully be disclosed to third parties relates exclusively to the examination of the lawfulness of the processing, those elements being irrelevant to determining whether the supervisory authority is competent to ensure the supervision of that processing operation on the basis of Article\u00a055 of Regulation 2016/679.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards processing such as that at issue in the main proceedings, it must be held that, without prejudice to compliance with the substantive obligations laid down by Regulation 2016/679, the processing of personal data carried out by courts in the context of their communication policy on cases before them, such as those consisting in the temporary making available to journalists of documents from a court case file in order to enable them to cover it in the media, inter alia, falls outside the competence of the supervisory authority, pursuant to Article\u00a055(3) of that regulation.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The determination, having regard to the subject matter and context of a given case, of the information from a court case file that may be provided to journalists in order to enable them to report on the course of court proceedings or to shed light on one or other aspect of a decision delivered is clearly linked to the exercise, by such courts, of their \u2018judicial capacity\u2019, the supervision of which by an external authority would be liable to undermine, in general, the independence of the judiciary.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Article\u00a055(3) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that a court makes temporarily available to journalists documents from court proceedings containing personal data in order to enable them better to report on the course of those proceedings falls within the exercise, by that court, of its \u2018judicial capacity\u2019, within the meaning of that provision.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a055(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that a court makes temporarily available to journalists documents from court proceedings containing personal data in order to enable them better to report on the course of those proceedings falls within the exercise, by that court, of its \u2018judicial capacity\u2019, within the meaning of that provision."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}
