The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 27 Sep 2017, C-73/16 (\nPu\u0161k\u00e1r\n)\nCharter of fundamental rights of

That expression is used for persons acting as \u2018fronts\u2019 in company director roles. Each natural person is, in principle, together with his national identity number and a tax identification number, associated with a legal person or legal persons\u00a0\u2014 of which there are 3\u00a0369, according to Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r\u2019s indications\u00a0\u2014 within which he is deemed to be performing duties during a determined period.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states that the existence of the contested list has been confirmed by the Financial Administration Criminal Office, which submits, however, that this list was drawn up by the Finance Directorate.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, the contested list is protected against \u2018unauthorised disclosure or access\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46, by appropriate technical and organisational measures. Nevertheless, neither in his pleadings nor at the hearing, did Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r claim that he had obtained the contested list with the consent legally required by the Finance Directorate or, where appropriate, the Financial Administration Criminal Office.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the order for reference that the Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad Slovenskej republiky (Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic) has dismissed as unfounded the actions brought by Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r and two other persons included on the contested list on procedural grounds, namely the fact that those applicants had not exhausted the remedies before the national administrative authorities, or on substantive grounds.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the subsequent constitutional appeals lodged by Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r and those two other persons, the \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad Slovenskej republiky (Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic), relying in particular on the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, held that, in so doing, the Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad Slovenskej republiky (Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic) had infringed several of those applicants\u2019 fundamental rights, namely, inter alia, the right to a fair trial, the right to privacy as well as the right to the protection of personal data. Consequently, the \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad Slovenskej republiky (Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic) set aside all of the judgments at issue of the Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad Slovenskej republiky (Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic) and referred the cases back to that court so that it would rule again, reminding it that it was bound by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights on the protection of personal data.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad Slovenskej republiky (Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic), the \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad Slovenskej republiky (Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic) did not take into account the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice on the application of EU law on the protection of personal data.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad Slovenskej republiky (Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does Article\u00a047(1) of the Charter, under which every person whose rights\u00a0\u2014 including the right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data in Article\u00a01(1) et seq. of Directive 95/46\u00a0\u2014 are violated has the right to an effective remedy before a court in compliance with the conditions in Article\u00a047 of the Charter, against a provision of national law which makes the exercise of an effective remedy before a court, meaning an administrative court, conditional on the fact that the claimant, to protect his rights and freedoms, must have previously exhausted the procedures available under \nlex specialis\n\u00a0\u2014 law on a specific subject\u00a0\u2014 such as the Slovak Law on administrative complaints?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can the right to respect for private and family life, home and communications, in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, and the right to the protection of personal data in Article\u00a08 be interpreted to the effect that where there is an alleged violation of the right to the protection of personal data, which, with respect to the European Union, is implemented primarily through Directive 95/46, and under which, in particular\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Member States must protect the right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data (Article [1](1)), and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Member States are authorised to process personal data where this is necessary for the implementation of a task performed in the public interest (Article\u00a07(e)) or is necessary for the purpose of a legitimate interests that is performed by the responsible authority or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a Member State is exceptionally authorised to limit obligations and rights (Article\u00a013(1)(e) and (f)), where such a restriction is necessary to safeguard an important economic or financial interest of a Member State or of the European Union, including monetary, budgetary and taxation matters,\nare interpreted in such a way as not to allow a Member State to create, without the consent of the person concerned, a list of personal data for the purposes of tax administration, so that the fact that personal data is made available to a public authority for the purpose of combating tax fraud in itself constitutes a risk?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can a list held by a financial authority of a Member State, which contains the claimant\u2019s personal data and the inaccessibility of which has been secured by appropriate technical and organisational measures for the protection of personal data against unauthorised disclosure or access within the meaning of Article\u00a017(1) of Directive 95/46, be regarded as unlawful evidence by virtue of the fact that it was obtained by the claimant without the lawful agreement of the relevant financial authority, which the referring court must refuse to admit in accordance with the requirements of EU law on a fair hearing in the second paragraph of Article\u00a047(2) of the Charter?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the abovementioned right to an effective legal remedy and to a fair hearing (in particular under Article\u00a047 of the Charter) consistent with an approach taken by the referring court whereby, when, in this case, there is case-law from the European Court of Human Rights which differs from the answer obtained from the Court of Justice of the European Union, the referring court, in accordance with the principle of sincere cooperation in Article\u00a04(3) TEU and Article\u00a0267 TFEU, gives precedence to the Court of Justice\u2019s legal approach?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nPreliminary observations\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be held at the outset, on the basis of the information provided by the referring court, that the data included on the contested list, namely, inter alia, the names of some natural persons, including Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r, are \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of the Directive 95/46, since they are \u2018information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019 (see, to that effect, judgments of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a035, and of 1\u00a0October 2015, \nBara and Others\n, C-201/14, EU:C:2015:638, paragraph\u00a029).\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both their collection and their use by the various tax authorities at issue in the case in the main proceedings therefore constitute \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) of that directive (see, to that effect, judgments of 20\u00a0May 2003, \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01, EU:C:2003:294, paragraph\u00a064; of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nHuber\n, C-524/06, EU:C:2008:724, paragraph\u00a043; and of 1\u00a0October 2015, \nBara and Others\n, C-201/14, EU:C:2015:638, paragraph\u00a029).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Spanish Government claims, however, that that processing of personal data is excluded from the scope of Directive 95/46 pursuant to the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) thereof, under which that directive does not apply, in any case, to processing operations of personal data concerning public security, defence, State security, including the economic well-being of the State when the processing operation relates to State security matters, and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that the activities which are mentioned by way of example in that article are, in any event, activities of the State or of State authorities unrelated to the fields of activity of individuals (see judgments of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a043, and of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a041).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has also considered that the activities mentioned by way of example in the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 are intended to define the scope of the exception which is provided for there, with the result that that exception applies only to the activities which are expressly listed there or which can be classified in the same category (see judgment of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a044).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as it renders inapplicable the system of protection of personal data provided for in Directive 95/46 and thus deviates from the objective underlying it, namely to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, the exception provided for in the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of that directive must be interpreted strictly.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case in the main proceedings it is apparent from the order for reference that the data at issue are collected and used for the purpose of collecting tax and combating tax fraud. Subject to the determinations to be carried out in that regard by the referring court, however, it does not appear that the processing of that data has as its object public security, defence or State security.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides, even if it does not appear to be excluded that that data may be used in criminal proceedings which may be brought, in the event of an infringement in the field of taxation, against certain persons whose names are included in the contested list, the data at issue in the case in the main proceedings do not appear to have been collected for the specific purpose of the pursuit of such criminal proceedings or in the context of State activities relating to areas of criminal law.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it is clear from the case-law of the Court that tax data constitute \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2015, \nBara and Others\n, C-201/14, EU:C:2015:638, paragraph\u00a029).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should be noted that Article\u00a013(1)(e) of Directive 95/46 authorises the Member States to take legislative measures to limit the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Article\u00a06(1), Article\u00a010, Article\u00a011(1) and Articles\u00a012 and 21 of that directive where such a restriction constitutes a measure necessary to safeguard an important economic or financial interest of a Member State or of the European Union, including monetary, budgetary and taxation matters. A limitation of the data protection provided by Directive 95/46 for tax purposes is accordingly expressly provided for in that directive.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 95/46 necessarily presupposes that the national measures referred to therein, such as those necessary to safeguard an important economic or financial interest of a Member State in the field of taxation, fall within the scope of that directive (see, by analogy, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a073).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that, subject to the determinations to be carried out by the referring court, processing of personal data, such as that at issue in the case in the main proceedings, falls within the scope of Directive 95/46.\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a047 of the Charter must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, which makes the exercise of a judicial remedy by a person stating that his right to protection of personal data guaranteed by Directive 95/46 has been infringed, subject to the prior exhaustion of the remedies available to him before the national administrative authorities (\u2018the available administrative remedies\u2019).\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Pu\u0161k\u00e1r and the Slovak Government dispute the admissibility of the first question referred.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Pu\u0161k\u00e1r claims, in particular, that that question is hypothetical in so far as, following the dismissal by the referring court of his first action on the ground that he had not lodged an administrative complaint, he had exhausted, prior to his second appeal before that court, all possible prior remedies.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, the Slovak Government points out that the order for reference mentions at least two proceedings initiated by Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r, without specifying which of them is the subject of the present reference for a preliminary ruling. It claims that the information contained in the order for reference does not make it possible to determine whether a complaint had been lodged under Law No\u00a09/2010, in which case the first question referred for a preliminary ruling would be inadmissible because of its hypothetical nature.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, according to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, in the context of the cooperation between the Court and the national courts provided for in Article\u00a0267 TFEU, it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, where the questions submitted concern the interpretation of EU law, the Court is, in principle, bound to give a ruling (see, in particular, judgment of 26\u00a0April 2017, \nStichting Brein\n, C-527/15, EU:C:2017:300, paragraph\u00a055 and the case-law cited).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Questions on the interpretation of EU law referred by a national court in the factual and legislative context which that court is responsible for defining, and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court to determine, enjoy a presumption of relevance (see judgment of 17\u00a0July 2014, \nYS and Others\n, C-141/12 and C-372/12, EU:C:2014:2081, paragraph\u00a063). The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought is unrelated to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (see, in particular, judgment of 26\u00a0April 2017, \nStichting Brein\n, C-527/15, EU:C:2017:300, paragraph\u00a056 and the case-law cited).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, that is not the case here. As was pointed out in paragraphs\u00a029 and 30 of the present judgment, it is clear from the order for reference that the Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad Slovenskej republiky (Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic) had initially rejected the actions brought by Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r and two other persons on the ground, inter alia, that they had not exhausted the available administrative remedies, and that those decisions were annulled by the \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad Slovenskej republiky (Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it is not obvious that the interpretation of EU law sought by the referring court bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the first question is admissible.\n\u00a0\nSubstance\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a022 of Directive 95/46 requires specifically that Member States shall provide for the right of every person to a judicial remedy for any breach of the rights guaranteed him by the national law applicable to the processing of personal data in question.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That directive, which does not contain any provisions governing specifically the conditions under which that remedy may be exercised, does not however exclude the possibility that national law may also establish remedies before the administrative authorities. On the contrary, it should be pointed out that Article\u00a022 expressly states that it is \u2018without prejudice to any administrative remedy for which provision may be made, inter alia before the supervisory authority referred to in Article\u00a028 [of Directive 95/46], prior to referral to the judicial authority\u2019, that Member States are to provide for the right of every person to that judicial remedy.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it is necessary to determine whether Article\u00a047 of the Charter precludes a Member State from providing that the exhaustion of available administrative remedies is a prerequisite for bringing such a judicial remedy.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, under the principle of sincere cooperation laid down in Article\u00a04(3) TEU it is for the courts of the Member States to ensure judicial protection of a person\u2019s rights under EU law, in addition, Article\u00a019(1) TEU requiring Member States to provide remedies sufficient to ensure effective judicial protection in the fields covered by EU law (see, inter alia, judgments of 8\u00a0November 2016, \nLesoochran\u00e1rske zoskupenie VLK\n, C-243/15, EU:C:2016:838, paragraph\u00a050, and of 26\u00a0July 2017, \nSacko\n, C-348/16, EU:C:2017:591, paragraph\u00a029).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That requirement on the part of the Member States corresponds to the right enshrined in Article\u00a047 of the Charter, entitled \u2018Right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial\u2019, which provides that everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are violated has the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0May 2017, \nBerlioz Investment Fund\n, C-682/15, EU:C:2017:373, paragraph\u00a044, and of 26\u00a0July 2017, \nSacko\n, C-348/16, EU:C:2017:591, paragraph\u00a030).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, when they set out detailed procedural rules for legal actions intended to ensure the protection of rights conferred by Directive 95/46, the Member States must ensure compliance with the right to an effective remedy and to a fair hearing, enshrined in Article\u00a047 of the Charter, which constitutes a reaffirmation of the principle of effective judicial protection (see, to that effect, judgments of 15\u00a0September 2016, \nStar Storage and Others\n, C-439/14 and C-488/14, EU:C:2016:688, paragraph\u00a046, and of 26\u00a0July 2017, \nSacko\n, C-348/16, EU:C:2017:591, paragraph\u00a031).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the characteristics of the remedy provided for in Article\u00a022 of Directive 95/46 must be determined in a manner that is consistent with Article\u00a047 of the Charter (see, by analogy, judgments of 17\u00a0December 2015, \nTall\n, C-239/14, EU:C:2015:824, paragraph\u00a051, and of 26\u00a0July 2017, \nSacko\n, C-348/16, EU:C:2017:591, paragraph\u00a031).\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is common ground in the case in the main proceedings that, by making the admissibility of a legal action brought by a person alleging infringement of his right to protection of personal data guaranteed by Directive 95/46 subject to the prior exhaustion of the administrative remedies available, the national legislation at issue introduces an additional step for access to the courts. As the Advocate General also stated in point\u00a053 of her Opinion, such a procedural rule would delay access to a judicial remedy and could also cause additional costs to be incurred.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The obligation to exhaust additional administrative remedies thereby constitutes, as a precondition for bringing a legal action, a limitation on the right to an effective remedy before a court within the meaning of Article\u00a047 of the Charter which, in accordance with Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter can therefore be justified only if it is provided for by law, if it respects the essence of that right and, subject to the principle of proportionality, if it is necessary and genuinely meets objectives of general interest recognised by the EU or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others (see, to that effect, judgment of 15\u00a0September 2016, \nStar Storage and Others\n, C-439/14 and C-488/14, paragraph\u00a049).\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be held that, in the case in the main proceedings, it is clear from the order for reference that the legal basis for the obligation to exhaust available administrative remedies is set out in Paragraph\u00a0250v(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, in such a way that it must be regarded as being provided for by national law (see, to that effect, judgment of 15\u00a0September 2016, \nStar Storage and Others\n, Case C-439/14 and C-488/14, paragraph\u00a050 and the case-law cited).\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, that obligation respects the essential content of the fundamental right to effective judicial protection, as enshrined in Article\u00a047 of the Charter. That obligation does not call into question that right as such. An additional procedural step is merely imposed in order to exercise it.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nonetheless, it must still be determined whether the obligation to exhaust available administrative remedies corresponds to an objective in the general interest and whether, in the affirmative, it complies with the principle of proportionality within the meaning of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from the order for reference and from the observations of the Slovak Government that the reasons for the mandatory introduction of an administrative complaint before bringing a legal action are linked, first, to the administrative authority, if it accepts the applicant\u2019s arguments, to remedy more quickly an unlawful situation when it finds that the complaint is well founded, and to avoid seeing unexpected actions brought against that authority in court. Second, those reasons relate to the fact that such an obligation contributes to the efficiency of the judicial procedure where that authority does not share the applicant\u2019s opinion and where the latter then lodges a legal action, because the judge can then rely on the existing administrative record.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus it appears that the obligation to exhaust available administrative remedies is intended to relieve the courts of disputes which can be decided directly before the administrative authority concerned and to increase the efficiency of judicial proceedings as regards disputes in which a legal action is brought despite the fact that a complaint has already been lodged. The obligation therefore pursues legitimate general interest objectives.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is clear from point\u00a062 of the Advocate General\u2019s Opinion, the obligation to exhaust the available administrative remedies appears appropriate for achieving those objectives, no less onerous method than that obligation suggesting itself as capable of realising those objectives as efficiently.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it is not evident that any disadvantages caused by the obligation to exhaust available administrative remedies are clearly disproportionate to those objectives (see, by analogy, judgment of 18\u00a0March 2010, \nAlassini and Others\n, C-317/08 to C-320/08, EU:C:2010:146, paragraph\u00a065).\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that the Court held that the principle of effective judicial protection, reaffirmed in Article\u00a047 of the Charter, did not preclude national legislation making the application of legal action in the field of electronic communications and consumer services subject to the prior implementation of out-of-court conciliation and mediation procedures provided that those procedures do not result in a decision which is binding on the parties, that they do not cause a substantial delay for the purposes of bringing legal proceedings, that they suspend the period for the time-barring of claims and that they do not give rise to costs\u00a0\u2014 or give rise to very low costs\u00a0\u2014 for the parties, and only if electronic means are not the only means by which the settlement procedure may be accessed and interim measures are possible in exceptional cases where the urgency of the situation so requires (see, to that effect, judgments of 18\u00a0March 2010, \nAlassini and Others\n, C-317/08 to C-320/08, EU:C:2010:146, paragraph\u00a067, and of 14\u00a0June 2017, \nMenini and Rampanelli\n, C-75/16, EU:C:2017:457, paragraph\u00a061).\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those various conditions apply \nmutatis mutandis\n to the obligation to exhaust the available administrative remedies at issue in the case in the main proceedings.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is therefore for the referring court to examine whether the practical arrangements for the exercise of administrative remedies available under Slovak law do not disproportionately affect the right to an effective remedy before a court referred to in Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should be noted that Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r claimed, inter alia, that there was uncertainty as to whether the period for bringing a legal action before the national court begins before a decision has been taken, was taken in the context of an action brought before the administrative authority concerned. If that were the case, the obligation to exhaust available administrative remedies, which might prevent access to judicial protection, would not comply with the right to an effective remedy before a court referred to in Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As far as delays are concerned, it should be borne in mind that Article\u00a047(2) of the Charter provides for the right of every person to have their case dealt with within a reasonable period of time. While that right admittedly relates to judicial proceedings themselves, it may not however be undermined by a condition prior to bringing a legal action.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the costs which a prior administrative complaint might entail, as the Advocate General also stated in points\u00a068 and 69 of her Opinion, although it is in principle permissible for Member States to impose an appropriate charge for bringing an action before an administrative authority, such a charge may not, however, be set at a level which might constitute an obstacle to the exercise of the right to a judicial remedy guaranteed by Article\u00a047 of the Charter. In that regard, account must be taken of the fact that that charge adds to the costs of the judicial proceedings.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question must be that Article\u00a047 of the Charter must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude national legislation, which makes the exercise of a judicial remedy by a person stating that his right to protection of personal data guaranteed by Directive 95/46 has been infringed, subject to the prior exhaustion of the available administrative remedies, provided that the practical arrangements for the exercise of such remedies do not disproportionately affect the right to an effective remedy before a court referred to in that article. It is important, in particular, that the prior exhaustion of the available administrative remedies does not lead to a substantial delay in bringing a legal action, that it involves the suspension of the limitation period of the rights concerned and that it does not involve excessive costs.\n\u00a0\nThe third question\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, which it is appropriate to examine in the second place, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a047 of the Charter must be interpreted as precluding that a national court rejects, as evidence of an infringement of the protection of personal data conferred by Directive 95/46, a list, such as the contested list, submitted by the data subject and containing personal data relating to him, if that person had obtained that list without the consent, legally required, of the person responsible for processing that data.\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several parties and interested parties having submitted observations to the Court take the view that the third question referred for a preliminary ruling is inadmissible.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, according to Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r and the Slovak Government, that question has no connection with EU law in the absence of EU rules on the lawfulness of evidence.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That argument cannot, however, be accepted.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is important to note that Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r seeks judicial review of a measure by the Slovak tax authorities, namely the drawing up of the contested list, by which the rights conferred on him by Directive 95/46 have, according to him, been infringed.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dismissal by the referring court of the evidence at issue in the main proceedings merely on the ground that Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r has obtained it without the consent, legally required, of the data controller constitutes a limitation on the right to a judicial remedy guaranteed by Article\u00a022 of Directive 95/46 and a limitation on the right to an effective remedy before a court within the meaning of Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the Czech Government has expressed doubts as to the relevance of the third question to the resolution of the dispute in the main proceedings, since one of the administrative authorities involved in that dispute, namely the Financial Administration Criminal Office, does not challenge the existence of the contested list. According to the Czech Government, the dispute in the main proceedings does not therefore raise any question as to the existence of the contested list, so that it is not necessary to decide on the admissibility of that list as evidence.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is sufficient to note that the referring court does not appear to have decided on the circumstances surrounding the drawing up of the contested list.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, having regard to the case-law referred to in paragraphs\u00a049 and 50 of the present judgment, it is not clear that the interpretation sought of EU law has nothing to do with the facts or the subject matter of the dispute in the main proceedings.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the third question must be considered to be admissible.\n\u00a0\nSubstance\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As has been stated in paragraph\u00a082 of the present judgment, rejecting a list, such as the contested list, as evidence of an infringement of the rights conferred by Directive 95/46, constitutes a limitation on the right to an effective remedy before a court within the meaning of Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from paragraph\u00a062 of the present judgment that such a restriction is justified only, in accordance with Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, if it is provided for by law, if it respects the essence of that right and, subject to the principle of proportionality, if it is necessary and genuinely meets objectives of general interest recognised by the EU or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, before the disputed list can be rejected as evidence, the referring court must first of all satisfy itself that that restriction of the right to an effective remedy is indeed provided for by national law.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, that court must examine whether such a rejection affects the essential content of the fundamental right to effective judicial protection, as enshrined in Article\u00a047 of the Charter. In that context, it will in particular be necessary to ascertain whether the existence of the contested list and the fact that it contains personal data relating to Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r are challenged in the context of the dispute in the main proceedings and, where appropriate, if he has other evidence in that regard.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, it will be for that court to determine whether the rejection of the contested list as evidence is necessary and does in fact satisfy the general interest objectives recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it appears that the objective of avoiding the unauthorised use of internal documents in judicial proceedings is capable of constituting a legitimate general interest objective (see, to that effect, orders of 23\u00a0October 2002, \nAustria \nv\n Council\n, C-445/00, EU:C:2002:607, paragraph\u00a012; of 23\u00a0March 2007, \nStadtgemeinde Frohnleiten and Gemeindebetriebe Frohnleiten\n, C-221/06, EU:C:2007:185, paragraph\u00a019; and of 29\u00a0January 2009, \nDonnici\n v \nParliament\n, C-9/08, not published, EU:C:2009:40, paragraph\u00a013). Furthermore, where a list, such as the contested list, is intended to remain confidential and also contains personal data of other natural persons, there is a need to protect the rights of those persons.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the rejection of a list, such as the contested list, as evidence obtained without the consent, legally required, of the authority responsible for processing the data appearing on that list, appears appropriate for achieving those objectives, it is however for the referring court to ascertain whether such a rejection does not disproportionately affect the right to an effective remedy before a court referred to in Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the very least, if the person whose personal data is on the list enjoys a right of access to those data, such rejection appears disproportionate to those very objectives.\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Article\u00a012 of Directive 95/46 guarantees everyone a right of access to the data collected relating to him. Furthermore, it is clear from Articles\u00a010 and 11 of Directive 95/46 that the person responsible for processing such data must provide the data subjects with certain information relating to that processing.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 95/46 limits the scope of the rights provided for in Articles\u00a010 to 12 of that directive where such a restriction constitutes a necessary measure to safeguard, in particular, the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or an important economic or financial interest of a Member State, including taxation and monitoring, inspection or regulatory functions, it expressly requires that such restrictions are imposed by legislative measures (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2015, \nBara and Others \nv\n Commission\n, C-201/14, EU:C:2015:638, paragraph\u00a039).\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in order to assess the proportionality of a rejection of the disputed list as evidence, the referring court must examine whether its national legislation limits, in relation to the data included in the list, information and access rights laid down in Articles\u00a010 to 12 of Directive 95/46 and if such a limitation is, where appropriate, justified. Moreover, even where that is the case and there is evidence to support a legitimate interest in the possible confidentiality of the contested list, the national courts must determine on a case-by-case basis whether this takes precedence over interest in the protection of the rights of the individual and whether, in the proceedings before that court, other means exist to ensure that confidentiality, in particular as regards the personal data of other natural persons included on that list.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the third question is that Article\u00a047 of the Charter must be interpreted as precluding that a national court rejects, as evidence of an infringement of the protection of personal data conferred by Directive 95/46, a list, such as the contested list, submitted by the data subject and containing personal data relating to him, if that person had obtained that list without the consent, legally required, of the person responsible for processing that data, unless such rejection is laid down by national legislation and respects both the essential content of the right to an effective remedy and the principle of proportionality.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directive 95/46 and Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter are to be interpreted as precluding the processing of personal data by the authorities of a Member State for the purpose of collecting tax and combating tax fraud such as that effected by drawing up the contested list in the main proceedings without the consent of the data subjects.\n\u00a0Admissibility\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Mr\u00a0Pu\u0161k\u00e1r, the second question is hypothetical and of no relevance to the outcome of the dispute in the main proceedings. In his view, the national court seeks only to ascertain whether the processing of personal data by the Finance Directorate is admissible as a general rule but does not specifically address the contested list which was designed by the Finance Directorate without legal basis.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must however be taken into account, having regard to the case-law referred to in paragraphs\u00a049 and 50 of the present judgment, and the information contained in the order for reference, that it is not clear that the interpretation of EU law sought has nothing to do with the facts or the subject matter of the dispute in the main proceedings.\n\u00a0\nSubstance\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second question must be examined in the light of Directive 95/46, inasmuch as, as is clear inter alia from the objective of that directive, as set out in Article\u00a01(1) thereof, as long as the conditions governing the legal processing of personal data under that directive are fulfilled, that processing shall be deemed to satisfy also the requirements laid down in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from paragraphs\u00a033 and 34 of the present judgment, the drawing up of a list, such as the contested list, which contains the names of certain natural persons and associates them with one or more legal persons within which those natural persons purport to act as company directors, constitutes \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of Directive 95/46, entitled \u2018General rules on the lawfulness of the processing of personal data\u2019, subject to the exceptions permitted under Article\u00a013 of that directive, all processing of personal data must comply, first, with the principles relating to data quality set out in Article\u00a06 of the directive and, secondly, with one of the criteria for making data processing legitimate listed in Article\u00a07 of that directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2015, \nBara and Others\n, C-201/14, EU:C:2015:638, paragraph\u00a030).\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also important to recall that it follows from the objective of ensuring an equivalent level of protection in all Member States, pursued by that directive, that Article\u00a07 thereof sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of cases in which the processing of personal data can be regarded as being lawful (see judgment of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nASNEF and FECEMD\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraph\u00a030).\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, it should be stated that Article\u00a07(e) provides that personal data may lawfully be processed if \u2018it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party to whom the data are disclosed\u2019.\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The establishment of the contested list appears likely to fall within that provision.\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It appears that the collection of the tax and combating tax fraud, for the purposes of which the contested list is established, must be regarded as tasks carried out in the public interest within the meaning of that provision.\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it is for the referring court to determine whether the Slovak authorities having compiled the list or those to whom it was notified have been invested with those missions by Slovak legislation.\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be observed that Article\u00a06(1)(b) of Directive 95/46 requires that personal data be collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes. As the Advocate General stated in point\u00a0106 of her Opinion, the objective of the processing of personal data is inextricably linked, within the scope of Article\u00a07(e) of Directive 95/46, to the task of the controller. Consequently, the transfer of the task to the latter must clearly include the purpose of the processing.\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also for the referring court to determine whether the establishment of the contested list is necessary for the performance of the tasks carried out in the public interest at issue in the case in the main proceedings, taking account, in particular, of the precise purpose of the establishment of the contested list, the legal effects to which the persons appearing on it and the public nature of that list are subject and whether or not that list is of a public nature.\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is important, in that regard, to ensure that the principle of proportionality is respected. The protection of the fundamental right to respect for private life at the European Union level requires that derogations from the protection of personal data and its limitations be carried out within the limits of what is strictly necessary (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a096 and the case-law cited).\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is thus for the national court to ascertain whether the establishment of the contested list and the inclusion of the names of the data subjects in such a register are suitable for achieving the objectives pursued by them and whether there is no other less restrictive means in order to achieve those objectives.\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that a person is placed on the contested list is likely to infringe some of his rights. Indeed, inclusion in that list could harm his reputation and affect his relations with the tax authorities. Likewise, such inclusion could affect the presumption of innocence of that person, set out in Article\u00a048(1) of the Charter, as well as the freedom of enterprise enshrined in Article\u00a016 of the Charter of legal persons associated with the natural persons included in the contested list. It appears that an infringement of this kind can be proportionate only if there are sufficient grounds to suspect the person concerned of purportedly acting as a company director of the legal persons associated with him and accordingly undermines the public interest in the collection of taxes and combating tax fraud.\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the referring court came to the conclusion that the establishment of the contested list is necessary for the performance of tasks carried out in the public interest of the controller in accordance with Article\u00a07(e) of Directive 95/46, it should also determine that the other conditions for the lawfulness of that processing of personal data imposed by the directive are satisfied, in particular those arising under Articles\u00a06 and 10 to 12 thereof.\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, if there were grounds for limiting, under Article\u00a013 of Directive 95/46, certain of the rights provided for in those articles, such as the right to information of the data subject, such a limitation should, as is clear from paragraph\u00a096 of the present judgment, be necessary for the protection of an interest referred to in Article\u00a013(1), such as, inter alia, an important economic and financial interest in the field of taxation and be based on legislative measures.\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a07(e) Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as not precluding the processing of personal data by the authorities of a Member State for the purpose of collecting tax and combating tax fraud such as that effected by drawing up the contested list in the main proceedings, without the consent of the data subjects, provided that, first, those authorities were invested by the national legislation with tasks carried out in the public interest within the meaning of that article, that the drawing-up of that list and the inclusion on it of the names of the data subjects in fact be appropriate and necessary for the purpose of attaining the objectives pursued and that there be sufficient indications to assume that the data subjects are rightly included in that list and, second, that all of the conditions for the lawfulness of that processing of personal data imposed by Directive 95/46 be satisfied.\n\u00a0\nThe fourth question\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, the national court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a047 of the Charter must be interpreted as precluding a national court, having found that, in a case before it, there are differences between the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights and that of the Court of Justice, following the latter.\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That question was raised by the referring court in general terms, without the latter clarifying in a clear and concrete manner what those differences are.\n120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be borne in mind that the requirements concerning the content of a request for a preliminary ruling are expressly set out in Article\u00a094 of the Court\u2019s Rules of Procedure, of which the national court should, in the context of the cooperation instituted by Article\u00a0267 TFEU, be aware and which it is bound to observe scrupulously. Thus, the referring court must set out the precise reasons that led it to raise the question of the interpretation of certain provisions of EU law and to consider it necessary to refer questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. The Court has previously held that it is essential that the national court should give at the very least some explanation of the reasons for the choice of the EU law provisions which it seeks to have interpreted and of the link it establishes between those provisions and the national legislation applicable to the proceedings pending before it (judgment of 9\u00a0March 2017, \nMilkova\n, C-406/15, EU:C:2017:198, paragraphs\u00a072 and 73 and the case-law cited).\n121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those requirements also appear in the recommendations of the Court of Justice of the European Union to national courts and tribunals in relation to the initiation of preliminary ruling proceedings (OJ 2016 C\u00a0439, p.\u00a01).\n122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it must be held that the fourth question does not satisfy the requirements set out in the preceding paragraphs.\n123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be borne in mind that, in accordance with the Court\u2019s settled case-law, the justification for making a request for a preliminary ruling is not for advisory opinions to be delivered on general or hypothetical questions, but rather that it is necessary for the effective resolution of a dispute concerning EU law (see judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0130).\n124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the third question is inadmissible.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a047 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude national legislation, which makes the exercise of a judicial remedy by a person stating that his right to protection of personal data guaranteed by Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, has been infringed, subject to the prior exhaustion of the remedies available to him before the national administrative authorities, provided that the practical arrangements for the exercise of such remedies do not disproportionately affect the right to an effective remedy before a court referred to in that article. It is important, in particular, that the prior exhaustion of the available remedies before the national administrative authorities does not lead to a substantial delay in bringing a legal action, that it involves the suspension of the limitation period of the rights concerned and that it does not involve excessive costs.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a047 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be interpreted as precluding that a national court rejects, as evidence of an infringement of the protection of personal data conferred by Directive 95/46, a list, such as the contested list, submitted by the data subject and containing personal data relating to him, if that person had obtained that list without the consent, legally required, of the person responsible for processing that data, unless such rejection is laid down by national legislation and respects both the essential content of the right to an effective remedy and the principle of proportionality.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a07(e) Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as not precluding the processing of personal data by the authorities of a Member State for the purpose of collecting tax and combating tax fraud such as that effected by drawing up of a list of persons such as that at issue in the main proceedings, without the consent of the data subjects, provided that, first, those authorities were invested by the national legislation with tasks carried out in the public interest within the meaning of that article, that the drawing-up of that list and the inclusion on it of the names of the data subjects in fact be adequate and necessary for the attainment of the objectives pursued and that there be sufficient indications to assume that the data subjects are rightly included in that list and, second, that all of the conditions for the lawfulness of that processing of personal data imposed by Directive 95/46 be satisfied."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\u2026 this difference may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of a number of economic activities at Community level, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Community law; \u2026 this difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of a wide variety of national laws, regulations and administrative provisions;\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026, in order to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of such data must be equivalent in all Member States; \u2026 this objective is vital to the internal market but cannot be achieved by the Member States alone, especially in view of the scale of the divergences which currently exist between the relevant laws in the Member States and the need to coordinate the laws of the Member States so as to ensure that the cross-border flow of personal data is regulated in a consistent manner that is in keeping with the objective of the internal market \u2026; \u2026 Community action to approximate those laws is therefore needed;\n\u2026\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 the object of the national laws on the processing of personal data is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, which is recognised both in Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms [signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950 (\u2018the ECHR\u2019)] and in the general principles of Community law; \u2026, for that reason, the approximation of those laws must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community\u2019.\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1 of Directive 95/46, entitled \u2018Object of the Directive\u2019, is drafted in the following terms: \n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with this Directive, Member States shall protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall neither restrict nor prohibit the free flow of personal data between Member States for reasons connected with the protection afforded under paragraph 1.\u2019\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 5 of Directive 95/46 is worded as follows: \n\u2018Member States shall, within the limits of the provisions of this Chapter, determine more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.\u2019\n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 7 of Directive 95/46 states: \n\u2018Member States shall provide that personal data may be processed only if:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the data subject has unambiguously given his consent;

Public sources are, exclusively, the electoral roll, telephone directories subject to the conditions laid down in the relevant regulations and lists of persons belonging to professional associations containing only data on the name, title, profession, activity, academic degree, address and an indication of membership of the association. Newspapers and official bulletins and the media are also public sources.\u2019 \n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 6(1) of Organic Law 15/1999 makes the processing of data subject to the data subject\u2019s unambiguous consent, unless otherwise provided by law. Thus, Article 6(2), \nin fine\n, of Organic Law 15/1999 provides that consent is not required, inter alia, \u2018\u2026 when the data are included in public sources and their processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller of the file or by the third party to whom the data are disclosed, except where this infringes the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.\u2019 \n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 11(1) of Organic Law 15/1999 reiterates the need for the data subject\u2019s consent in order to disclose personal data to third parties, while Article 11(2), however, provides that that consent is not necessary, inter alia, in relation to data appearing in public sources. \n\u00a0Royal Decree 1720/2007\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Spanish Government implemented Organic Law 15/1999 by way of Royal Decree 1720/2007 (BOE No\u00a017 of 19\u00a0January 2008, p.\u00a04103). \n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 10(1) of Royal Decree 1720/2007 allows the processing and transfer of personal data in cases where the data subject has given prior consent. \n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Article 10(2) of Royal Decree 1720/2007 provides:\n\u2018\u2026 personal data may be processed or transferred without the data subject\u2019s consent when: \n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0it is authorised by a regulation having the force of law or under Community law and, in particular, when one of the following situations applies: \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the purpose of the processing or transfer is to satisfy a legitimate interest of the data controller or recipient guaranteed by these rules, as long as the interest or fundamental rights and liberties of the data subjects, as provided in Article 1 of Organic Law 15/1999 of 13\u00a0December, are not overriding;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the processing or transfer of data is necessary in order for the data controller to fulfil a duty imposed upon him by one of those provisions; \n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the data which are the subject of processing or transfer are in sources accessible to the public and the data controller, or the third party to whom data has been communicated, has a legitimate interest in their processing or knowledge, as long as the fundamental rights and liberties of the data subject are not breached. \nThe aforesaid notwithstanding, the public administration may communicate the data collected from sources accessible to the public to the data controllers of privately owned files pursuant to this subsection only when they are so authorised by a regulation having the force of law.\u2019 \n\u00a0\nThe disputes in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ASNEF, on the one hand, and FECEMD, on the other hand, have brought administrative proceedings challenging several articles of Royal Decree 1720/2007. \n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among the contested provisions are the first indent of Article 10(2)(a) and the first subparagraph of Article 10(2)(b) of Royal Decree 1720/2007, which ASNEF and FECEMD believe are in breach of Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46. \n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, ASNEF and FECEMD take the view that Spanish law adds, to the condition relating to the legitimate interest in data processing without the data subject\u2019s consent, a condition, which does not exist in Directive 95/46, to the effect that the data should appear in public sources. \n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal Supremo (Supreme Court, Spain) considers that the merits of the actions brought by ASNEF and FECEMD respectively depend to a large extent on the interpretation by the Court of Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46. Accordingly, it states that, if the Court were to hold that Member States are not entitled to add extra conditions to those required by that provision, and if that provision were to be found to have direct effect, Article 10(2)(b) of Royal Decree 1720/2007 would have to be set aside. \n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal Supremo explains that, in the absence of the data subject\u2019s consent, and in order to allow processing of that data subject\u2019s personal data that is necessary to pursue a legitimate interest of the data controller or of the third party or parties to whom those data are disclosed, Spanish law requires not only that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject be respected, but also that the data appear in the files listed in Article 3(j) of Organic Law 15/1999. In that regard, it takes the view that Organic Law 15/1999 and Royal Decree 1720/2007 restrict the scope of Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46. \n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the view of the Tribunal Supremo, that restriction constitutes a barrier to the free movement of personal data that is compatible with Directive 95/46 only if the interest or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject so require. It concludes that the only way to avoid a contradiction between Directive 95/46 and Spanish law is to hold that the free movement of personal data appearing in files other than those listed in Article 3(j) of Organic Law 15/1999 infringes the interest or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. \n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the Tribunal Supremo is unsure whether such an interpretation is in accordance with the intention of the EU legislature. \n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, being of the view that the outcome of both the cases before it depends on the interpretation of provisions of EU law, the Tribunal Supremo decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions, which are formulated in identical terms in both cases, to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article 7(f) of [Directive 95/46] be interpreted as precluding the application of national rules which, in the absence of the interested party\u2019s consent, and to allow processing of his personal data that is necessary to pursue a legitimate interest of the controller or of third parties to whom the data will be disclosed, not only require that fundamental rights and freedoms should not be prejudiced, but also require the data to appear in public sources?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are the conditions for conferring on it direct effect, set out in the case-law of the Court \u2026 met by the abovementioned Article 7(f)?\u2019 \n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By order of the President of the Court of 26\u00a0October 2010, Cases C-468/10 and C-469/10 were joined for the purposes of the written and oral procedure and the judgment.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred \n\u00a0\nThe first question\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the national court asks, in essence, whether Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as precluding national rules which, in the absence of the data subject\u2019s consent, and in order to allow such processing of that data subject\u2019s personal data as is necessary to pursue a legitimate interest of the data controller or of the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, requires not only that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject be respected, but also that the data should appear in public sources.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1 of Directive 95/46 requires Member States to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their privacy, in relation to the handling of personal data (see, to that effect, Case C-524/06 \nHuber \n[2008] ECR I-9705, paragraph 47). \n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of Directive 95/46, entitled \u2018General rules on the lawfulness of the processing of personal data\u2019, all processing of personal data must, subject to the exceptions permitted under Article 13, comply, first, with the principles relating to data quality set out in Article 6 of Directive 95/46 and, secondly, with one of the six principles for making data processing legitimate listed in Article 7 of Directive 95/46 (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n [2003] ECR I-4989, paragraph 65, and \nHuber\n, paragraph 48). \n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to recital 7 in the preamble to Directive 95/46, the establishment and functioning of the internal market are liable to be seriously affected by differences in national rules applicable to the processing of personal data (Case C-101/01 \nLindqvist \n[2003] ECR I-12971, paragraph 79).\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it must be noted that Directive 95/46 is intended, as appears from, inter alia, recital 8 in the preamble thereto, to ensure that the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data is equivalent in all Member States. Recital 10 adds that the approximation of the national laws applicable in this area must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the EU (see, to that effect, \nLindqvist\n, paragraph 95, and \nHuber\n, paragraph 50).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it has been held that the harmonisation of those national laws is not limited to minimal harmonisation but amounts to harmonisation which is generally complete. It is upon that view that Directive 95/46 is intended to ensure free movement of personal data while guaranteeing a high level of protection for the rights and interests of the individuals to whom such data relate (\nLindqvist\n, paragraph 96). \n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, it follows from the objective of ensuring an equivalent level of protection in all Member States that Article 7 of Directive 95/46 sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of cases in which the processing of personal data can be regarded as being lawful. \n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is corroborated by the term \u2018may be processed only if\u2019 and its juxtaposition with \u2018or\u2019 contained in Article 7 of Directive 95/46, which demonstrate the exhaustive and restrictive nature of the list appearing in that article. \n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that Member States cannot add new principles relating to the lawfulness of the processing of personal data to Article 7 of Directive 95/46 or impose additional requirements that have the effect of amending the scope of one of the six principles provided for in Article 7. \n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The foregoing interpretation is not brought into question by Article 5 of Directive\u00a095/46. Article 5 merely authorises Member States to specify, within the limits of Chapter II of that directive and, accordingly, Article 7 thereof, the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The margin of discretion which Member States have pursuant to Article\u00a05 can therefore be used only in accordance with the objective pursued by Directive\u00a095/46 of maintaining a balance between the free movement of personal data and the protection of private life (\nLindqvist\n, paragraph 97). \n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 95/46 includes rules with a degree of flexibility and, in many instances, leaves to the Member States the task of deciding the details or choosing between options (\nLindqvist\n, paragraph 83). A distinction, consequently, must be made between national measures that provide for additional requirements amending the scope of a principle referred to in Article 7 of Directive 95/46, on the one hand, and national measures which provide for a mere clarification of one of those principles, on the other hand. The first type of national measure is precluded. It is only in the context of the second type of national measure that Member States have, pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 95/46, a margin of discretion. \n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, under Article 5 of Directive 95/46, Member States also cannot introduce principles relating to the lawfulness of the processing of personal data other than those listed in Article 7 thereof, nor can they amend, by additional requirements, the scope of the six principles provided for in Article 7. \n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present cases, Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 provides that the processing of personal data is lawful if it is \u2018necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection under Article 1(1)\u2019.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 7(f) sets out two cumulative conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the processing of personal data to be lawful: firstly, the processing of the personal data must be necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed; and, secondly, such interests must not be overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. \n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in relation to the processing of personal data, Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 precludes any national rules which, in the absence of the data subject\u2019s consent, impose requirements that are additional to the two cumulative conditions set out in the preceding paragraph. \n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, account must be taken of the fact that the second of those conditions necessitates a balancing of the opposing rights and interests concerned which depends, in principle, on the individual circumstances of the particular case in question and in the context of which the person or the institution which carries out the balancing must take account of the significance of the data subject\u2019s rights arising from Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019). \n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, it must be noted that Article 8(1) of the Charter states that \u2018[e]veryone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her\u2019. That fundamental right is closely connected with the right to respect for private life expressed in Article 7 of the Charter (Joined Cases C-92/09 and C-93/09 \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert \n[2010] ECR I-0000, paragraph 47).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the right to respect for private life with regard to the processing of personal data, recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, concerns any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (\nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, paragraph 52). However, it follows from Articles 8(2) and 52(1) of the Charter that, under certain conditions, limitations may be imposed on that right. \n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, Member States must, when transposing Directive 95/46, take care to rely on an interpretation of that directive which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights and freedoms protected by the EU legal order (see, by analogy, Case C-275/06 \nPromusicae\n [2008] ECR I-271, paragraph\u00a068). \n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In relation to the balancing which is necessary pursuant to Article 7(f) of Directive\u00a095/46, it is possible to take into consideration the fact that the seriousness of the infringement of the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights resulting from that processing can vary depending on whether or not the data in question already appear in public sources.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike the processing of data appearing in public sources, the processing of data appearing in non-public sources necessarily implies that information relating to the data subject\u2019s private life will thereafter be known by the data controller and, as the case may be, by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed. This more serious infringement of the data subject\u2019s rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter must be properly taken into account by being balanced against the legitimate interest pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed. \n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be noted that there is nothing to preclude Member States, in the exercise of their discretion laid down in Article 5 of Directive 95/46, from establishing guidelines in respect of that balancing. \n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it is no longer a precision within the meaning of Article 5 of Directive\u00a095/46 if national rules exclude the possibility of processing certain categories of personal data by definitively prescribing, for those categories, the result of the balancing of the opposing rights and interests, without allowing a different result by virtue of the particular circumstances of an individual case. \n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, without prejudice to Article 8 of Directive 95/46 concerning the processing of particular categories of data, a provision which is not at issue in the main proceedings, Article 7(f) of that directive precludes a Member State from excluding, in a categorical and generalised manner, the possibility of processing certain categories of personal data, without allowing the opposing rights and interests at issue to be balanced against each other in a particular case. \n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of those considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as precluding national rules which, in the absence of the data subject\u2019s consent, and in order to allow such processing of that data subject\u2019s personal data as is necessary to pursue a legitimate interest of the data controller or of the third party or parties to whom those data are disclosed, require not only that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject be respected, but also that those data should appear in public sources, thereby excluding, in a categorical and generalised way, any processing of data not appearing in such sources.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the national court asks, in essence, whether Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 has direct effect.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, whenever the provisions of a directive appear, so far as their subject-matter is concerned, to be unconditional and sufficiently precise, they may be relied on before the national courts by individuals against the State where the latter has failed to implement that directive in domestic law by the end of the period prescribed or where it has failed to implement that directive correctly (see Case C-203/10 \nAuto Nikolovi \n[2011] ECR I-0000, paragraph 61 and the case-law cited). \n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be stated that Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 is a provision that is sufficiently precise to be relied on by an individual and applied by the national courts. Moreover, while that directive undoubtedly confers on the Member States a greater or lesser discretion in the implementation of some of its provisions, Article 7(f), for its part, states an unconditional obligation (see, by analogy, \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, paragraph 100).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use of the expression \u2018except where\u2019 in the actual text of Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 is not such, by itself, as to cast doubt on the unconditional nature of that provision, within the meaning of that case-law.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That expression is intended to establish one of the two cumulative elements provided for in Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 to which the possibility of processing personal data without the data subject\u2019s consent is subject. As that element is defined, it does not deprive Article 7(f) of its precise and unconditional nature.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the second question is therefore that Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 has direct effect. \n\u00a0\nCosts\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the actions pending before the national court, the decisions on costs are a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. \nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle 7(f) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as precluding national rules which, in the absence of the data subject\u2019s consent, and in order to allow such processing of that data subject\u2019s personal data as is necessary to pursue a legitimate interest of the data controller or of the third party or parties to whom those data are disclosed, require not only that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject be respected, but also that the data should appear in public sources, thereby excluding, in a categorical and generalised way, any processing of data not appearing in such sources.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle 7(f) of Directive 95/46 has direct effect."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law.\u00a0\u2026\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation.\u00a0\u2026 This Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member\u00a0States to specify [their] rules, including for the processing of special categories of personal data\u00a0\u2026 To that extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States.\n\u2026\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The responsibility and liability of the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on the controller\u2019s behalf should be established. In particular, the controller should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.\n\u2026\n(129)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure consistent monitoring and enforcement of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory authorities should have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers, including powers of investigation, corrective powers and sanctions\u00a0\u2026 In particular each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate in view of ensuring compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the circumstances of each individual case, respect the right of every person to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons concerned. Investigatory powers as regards access to premises should be exercised in accordance with specific requirements in Member State procedural law, such as the requirement to obtain a prior judicial authorisation. Each legally binding measure of the supervisory authority should be in writing, be clear and unambiguous, indicate the supervisory authority which has issued the measure, the date of issue of the measure, bear the signature of the head, or a member of the supervisory authority authorised by him or her, give the reasons for the measure, and refer to the right of an effective remedy.

It holds, indirectly via participating interests in various companies, approximately 163\u00a0000 housing units and 3\u00a0000 commercial units.\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The owners of those units are subsidiaries of DW (\u2018holding companies\u2019) which carry on the operational side of the business, while DW is responsible for the central management of the group of which it forms part, together with, inter alia, those subsidiaries. The holding companies lease the housing and commercial units which are managed by other companies in the group, known as \u2018service companies\u2019.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As part of their business activities, DW and the group companies which it manages process personal data of tenants of the commercial and housing units, such as, for example, proof of identity, tax, social security and health insurance data of those tenants, as well as data relating to previous tenancies.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 23\u00a0June 2017, the Berliner Beauftragte f\u00fcr den Datenschutz (Berlin Data Protection Authority, Germany; \u2018the supervisory authority\u2019) informed DW during an on-the-spot inspection that companies within its group were storing the personal data of tenants in an electronic filing system in respect of which it could not be ascertained whether storage was necessary or whether there were safeguards to ensure the erasure of data which were no longer required. \n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The supervisory authority requested DW to erase those documents from its electronic filing system by the end of 2017 at the latest. In response to that request, DW stated that it was not possible for technical and legal reasons to erase those documents.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following exchanges between DW and the supervisory authority concerning whether it was possible to erase the documents at issue, DW informed that authority that it intended to introduce a new storage system to replace the system which contained those documents.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 5\u00a0March 2019, the supervisory authority carried out an inspection at the corporate headquarters of the group managed by DW. During that inspection, DW informed that authority that the electronic filing system in question had already been decommissioned and that the data would be migrated to the new storage system imminently.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 30\u00a0October 2019, the supervisory authority imposed on DW an administrative fine of EUR\u00a014\u00a0385\u00a0000 for intentional infringement of Article\u00a05(1)(a), (c) and (e) and of Article\u00a025(1) of the GDPR (\u2018the decision at issue\u2019). By that decision, that authority also imposed 15 other fines on DW of between EUR\u00a03\u00a0000 and EUR\u00a017\u00a0000 in respect of the infringement of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the decision at issue, the supervisory authority found, more specifically, that DW had intentionally failed, between 25\u00a0May 2018 and 5\u00a0March 2019, to take the measures necessary to allow personal data relating to tenants regularly to be erased where such data were no longer necessary or had, for some other reason, erroneously been stored. It also stated that DW had continued to store the personal data of at least 15 named tenants where such storage was not necessary.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DW brought an action against that decision before the Landgericht Berlin (Regional Court, Berlin, Germany). That court closed the proceedings without taking further action, holding that the decision at issue was vitiated by such serious defects that it could not serve as a basis for the imposition of a fine. \n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court stated, inter alia, that the imposition of a fine on a legal person is exhaustively regulated by Paragraph\u00a030 of the OWiG which, pursuant to Paragraph\u00a041(1) of the Federal Law on data protection, applies to the infringements referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) of the GDPR. Under Paragraph\u00a030 of the OWiG, a finding of an administrative infringement can be made only against a natural person and not against a legal person. In addition, only the actions of representatives of the legal person or of members of bodies thereof can be attributed to that legal person. While Paragraph\u00a030(4) of the OWiG makes it possible, subject to certain conditions, to initiate independent proceedings for an administrative fine against a legal person, the fact remains that, also in those circumstances, it is necessary that a finding of an administrative infringement can be made against the members of bodies or representatives of the legal person concerned.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Staatsanwaltschaft Berlin (Berlin Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office) brought an appeal against the first-instance decision before the Kammergericht Berlin (Higher Regional Court, Berlin, Germany), which is the referring court.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court asks, in the first place, whether, pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the GDPR, it must be possible to impose an administrative fine on a legal person without the infringement of that regulation first being attributed to an identified natural person. In that context, the referring court considers, in particular, the relevance of the concept of an \u2018undertaking\u2019 within the meaning of Articles\u00a0101 and 102 TFEU.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring court explains that, according to national case-law, the limited liability regime of legal persons under national law conflicts with the regime of direct liability of undertakings laid down in Article\u00a083 of the GDPR. According to that case-law, it is apparent, in particular, from the wording of Article\u00a083 of the GDPR, which, in accordance with the principle of primacy of EU law, prevails over the national regime, that administrative fines may be imposed on undertakings. It is therefore not necessary for the imposition of such fines to be linked to a wrongful act on the part of the bodies or directors of legal persons, contrary to the requirements of the applicable national law.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, that case-law, like the majority of national academic legal literature, attaches particular importance to the concept of an \u2018undertaking\u2019, within the meaning of Articles\u00a0101 and 102 TFEU, and therefore to the idea that liability is attributed to the economic entity within which the undesirable conduct, for example anticompetitive conduct, occurred. Under that \u2018functional\u2019 interpretation, all acts of all employees authorised to act on behalf of an undertaking are attributable to the undertaking, including in relation to administrative proceedings.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, were the Court to find that an administrative fine must be able to be imposed directly on a legal person, the referring court raises the question of the criteria which must be applied in order to establish the liability of a legal person, as an undertaking, for an infringement of the GDPR. It wishes to ascertain, in particular, whether an administrative fine may be imposed pursuant to Article\u00a083 of that regulation on a legal person without it being established that the infringement of that regulation attributed to that legal person was committed wrongfully.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Kammergericht Berlin (Higher Regional Court, Berlin) decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a083(4) to (6) of the GDPR to be interpreted as incorporating into national law the functional concept of an undertaking and the principle of an economic entity, as defined in Articles\u00a0101 and 102 TFEU, as a result of which, by broadening the principle of a legal entity underpinning Paragraph\u00a030 of the [OWiG], proceedings for an administrative fine may be brought against an undertaking directly and a fine imposed without requiring a finding that a natural and identified person committed an administrative offence, if necessary, in satisfaction of the objective and subjective elements of tortious liability?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question\u00a01 is answered in the affirmative: is Article\u00a083(4) to (6) of the GDPR to be interpreted as meaning that the undertaking must have intentionally or negligently committed the breach of an obligation vicariously through an employee (see Article\u00a023 of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01/2003 of 16\u00a0December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles\u00a081 and 82 of the Treaty (OJ 2003 L\u00a01, p.\u00a01)) or, is the objective fact of breach caused by it sufficient, in principle, for a fine to be imposed on that undertaking (\u201cstrict liability\u201d)?\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe request to have the written procedure reopened\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the hearing held on 17\u00a0January 2023, DW, by a document lodged at the Court Registry on 23\u00a0March 2023, applied for an order that the oral part of the procedure be reopened, pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In support of its request, DW maintains, in essence, that the replies given by the referring court to the request for clarification addressed to it under Article\u00a0101 of the Rules of Procedure provide the Court with incorrect information concerning the applicable provisions of national law. A comprehensive debate concerning that issue was not possible at the hearing on 17\u00a0January 2023 because the parties had become aware of those replies only three working days before that hearing. Such a time period did not have allow for thorough preparation for the hearing.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, in accordance with Article\u00a083 of the Rules of Procedure, the Court may at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information, or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the interested persons.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in the present case, the Court has all the information necessary to give a ruling and the present case does not have to be decided on the basis of arguments which have not been debated by the interested persons. In addition, the request that the oral part of the procedure be reopened does not disclose any new fact which is of such a nature as to be capable of being a decisive factor for the decision which the Court is called upon to make in that case.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Court considers, after hearing the Advocate General, that there is no need to order that the oral part of the procedure be reopened.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a058(2) and Article\u00a083(1) to (6) of the GDPR must be interpreted as precluding national legislation under which an administrative fine may be imposed on a legal person in its capacity as controller in respect of an infringement referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) only in so far as that infringement has previously been attributed to an identified natural person.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, in its written observations, the German Government expressed doubts as to that interpretation of national law by the referring court, on the ground that Paragraph\u00a0130 of the OWiG also allows a fine to be imposed on a legal person outside the cases covered by Paragraph\u00a030 of the OWiG. Furthermore, those two provisions make it possible to impose an \u2018anonymous\u2019 fine in the context of proceedings brought against the undertaking, without it being necessary to identify the natural person who committed the infringement in question.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In response to a request for clarification sent to the referring court, referred to in paragraph\u00a028 of the present judgment, that court stated that Paragraph\u00a0130 of the OWiG has no bearing on the first question referred.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, that provision concerns the owner of a business or of an undertaking, who must have wrongfully failed to fulfil an obligation to supervise. Evidence of such a failure to fulfil obligations attributable to the owner of the undertaking is, however, extremely complex and often impossible to adduce, and the question whether a group of undertakings may be classified as an \u2018undertaking\u2019 or \u2018owner of undertakings\u2019 in accordance with that provision is the subject of divergent opinions at national level. In any event, the first question referred for a preliminary ruling is also relevant in that context.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be recalled that, as far as the interpretation of provisions of national law is concerned, the Court is in principle required to rely on the description given in the order for reference. According to settled case-law, the Court does not have jurisdiction to interpret the internal law of a Member State (judgment of 26\u00a0January 2021, \nHessischer Rundfunk\n, C-422/19 and C-423/19, EU:C:2021:63, paragraph\u00a031 and the case-law cited).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the answer to the first question referred for a preliminary ruling takes as a premiss that, under the applicable national law, an administrative fine may be imposed on a legal person in its capacity as controller in respect of an infringement referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) of the GDPR only subject to the conditions laid down in Paragraph\u00a030 of the OWiG, as set out by the referring court.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer the first question referred for a preliminary ruling, it must be stated, first of all, that the principles, prohibitions and obligations laid down by the GDPR are directed, in particular, at \u2018controllers\u2019 whose responsibility extends, as stated in recital\u00a074 of the GDPR, to any processing of personal data which they carry out themselves or which is carried out on their behalf, and who are required, on that basis, not only to implement appropriate and effective measures, but also to be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with the GDPR, including the effectiveness of the measures adopted to ensure such compliance. It is that responsibility which forms, in the event of one of the infringements referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) of that regulation, the basis for the imposition of an administrative fine on the controller pursuant to Article\u00a083 of that regulation.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR defines the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 broadly, as referring to the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The objective of that broad definition in Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR\u00a0\u2013 which expressly includes legal persons\u00a0\u2013 is, in a manner consistent with the objective of the GDPR, to ensure effective protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, to ensure a high level of protection of the right of every person to the protection of personal data concerning him or her (see, to that effect, judgments of 29\u00a0July 2019, \nFashion ID\n, C-40/17, EU:C:2019:629, paragraph\u00a066, and of 28\u00a0April 2022, \nMeta Platforms Ireland\n, C-319/20, EU:C:2022:322, paragraph\u00a073 and the case-law cited).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the Court has previously held that a natural or legal person who exerts influence over the processing of personal data, for his own purposes, and who participates, as a result, in the determination of the purposes and means of that processing, may be regarded as a controller (see, to that effect, judgment of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a068).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It therefore follows from the wording and purpose of Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR that the EU legislature did not distinguish, for the purposes of determining liability under that regulation, between natural persons and legal persons, that liability being subject to the sole condition that those persons, alone or jointly with others, determine the purposes and means of processing of personal data.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, subject to what is provided for in Article\u00a083(7) of the GDPR concerning public authorities and bodies, any person meeting that condition\u00a0\u2013 regardless of whether a natural person, a legal person, a public authority, a service or another body\u00a0\u2013 is responsible, inter alia, for any infringement referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) which is committed by that person or on behalf of that person.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards legal persons, that implies, first, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in points\u00a057 to 59 of his Opinion, that legal persons are liable not only for infringements committed by their representatives, directors or managers, but also by any other person acting in the course of the business of those legal persons and on their behalf. Second, the administrative fines provided for in Article\u00a083 of the GDPR in respect of such infringements must be capable of being imposed directly on legal persons where they may be classified as the controllers in question.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, it must be stated that Article\u00a058(2) of the GDPR sets out in detail the supervisory authorities\u2019 corrective powers, without referring to the law of the Member States or leaving any discretion to those States. First, those powers, which include, under Article\u00a058(2)(i) of the GDPR, the power to impose an administrative fine, relate to the controller and, second, such a controller may, as is apparent from paragraph\u00a039 of the present judgment, be a natural person or a legal person. The substantive conditions which a supervisory authority must satisfy when imposing such a fine are, for their part, laid down in Article\u00a083(1) to (6), in precise terms and without leaving any discretion to the Member States.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It thus follows from a combined reading of Article\u00a04(7), Article\u00a083 and Article\u00a058(2)(i) of the GDPR that an administrative fine in respect of an infringement referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) may also be imposed on legal persons where they are controllers. By contrast, no provision of the GDPR permits the inference that the imposition of an administrative fine on a legal person as a controller is subject to a previous finding that that infringement was committed by an identified natural person.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that it is apparent from Article\u00a058(4) and Article\u00a083(8) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital\u00a0129 of that regulation, that the exercise by the supervisory authority of its powers under those articles is to be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with EU and Member State law, including effective judicial remedy and due process.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the fact that that regulation accordingly provides Member States with the possibility to lay down requirements concerning the procedure to be followed by the supervisory authorities in order to impose an administrative fine in no way means that they are also authorised to lay down, in addition to such procedural requirements, substantive conditions over and above those set by Article\u00a083(1) to (6). In addition, the fact that the EU legislature took care to make express provision for that possibility but not the possibility to lay down such additional substantive conditions confirms that it did not provide the Member States with a margin of discretion in that regard. Those substantive conditions therefore fall solely within the scope of EU law.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The literal interpretation of Article\u00a058(2) and Article\u00a083(1) to (6) of the GDPR set out above is borne out by the purpose of that regulation.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent, in particular, from recital\u00a010 of the GDPR that the objectives of the provisions of that regulation are, inter alia, to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data within the European Union and, to that end, to ensure consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of those persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union. Recitals\u00a011 and 129 of the GDPR emphasise, moreover, the need to ensure, in order to ensure consistent application of that regulation, that supervisory authorities have equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and that they can impose equivalent sanctions where that regulation is infringed.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To allow Member States to make it a requirement, unilaterally and as a necessary condition for the imposition of an administrative fine pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the GDPR on a controller who is a legal person, that the infringement in question is first attributed or attributable to an identified natural person, would be contrary to that purpose of the GDPR. In addition, such an additional requirement would, ultimately, risk weakening the effectiveness and deterrent effect of administrative fines imposed on legal persons as controllers, contrary to Article\u00a083(1) of the GDPR.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that the second paragraph of Article\u00a0288 TFEU provides that an EU regulation is to be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States, which precludes, unless otherwise provided, Member States from taking steps which are intended to alter the scope of such a regulation. In addition, the Member States are under a duty, by virtue of the obligations arising from the FEU Treaty, not to obstruct the direct applicability inherent in regulations. In particular, they must not adopt a measure by which the nature of EU law and the consequences which arise from it are concealed from the persons concerned (judgment of 15\u00a0November 2012, \nAl-Aqsa\n v \nCouncil \nand \nNetherlands\n v \nAl-Aqsa\n, C-539/10\u00a0P and C-550/10\u00a0P, EU:C:2012:711, paragraphs\u00a086 and 87 and the case-law cited).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, in view of the referring court\u2019s questions, it should be stated that the concept of an \u2018undertaking\u2019, within the meaning of Articles\u00a0101 and 102 TFEU, has no bearing on whether and under what conditions an administrative fine may be imposed pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the GDPR on a controller who is a legal person, since that question is exhaustively regulated by Article\u00a058(2) and Article\u00a083(1) to (6) of that regulation.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That concept is relevant only for the purpose of determining the amount of the administrative fine imposed under Article\u00a083(4) to (6) of the GDPR on a controller.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a045 of his Opinion, the reference in recital\u00a0150 of the GDPR to the concept of an \u2018undertaking\u2019, within the meaning of Articles\u00a0101 and 102 TFEU, is to be understood in that specific context of the calculation of administrative fines imposed in respect of the infringements referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) of the GDPR.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be stated that, for the purposes of applying the competition rules, referred to in Articles\u00a0101 and 102 TFEU, that concept covers any entity engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of the legal status of that entity and the way in which it is financed. The concept of an undertaking therefore defines an economic unit even if in law that economic unit consists of several persons, natural or legal. That economic unit consists of a unitary organisation of personal, tangible and intangible elements which pursues a specific economic aim on a long-term basis (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2021, \nSumal\n, C-882/19, EU:C:2021:800, paragraph\u00a041 and the case-law cited).\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it is apparent from Article\u00a083(4) to (6) of the GDPR, which concerns the calculation of administrative fines in respect of the infringements listed in those paragraphs, that, where the addressee of the administrative fine is or forms part of an undertaking, within the meaning of Articles\u00a0101 and 102 TFEU, the maximum amount of the administrative fine is calculated on the basis of a percentage of the total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding business year of the undertaking concerned.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a047 of his Opinion, only an administrative fine determined on the basis of the actual or material economic capacity of the person on which it is imposed, and therefore imposed by the supervisory authority, relying, as regards the amount of that fine, on the concept of an economic unit within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a056 of the present judgment, is capable of satisfying the three conditions set out in Article\u00a083(1) of the GDPR, namely to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, where a supervisory authority decides, by virtue of its powers under Article\u00a058(2) of the GDPR, to impose on a controller, which is or forms part of an undertaking, within the meaning of Articles\u00a0101 and 102 TFEU, an administrative fine pursuant to Article\u00a083 of that regulation, that authority is required to take as its basis, under Article\u00a083 GDPR, read in the light of recital\u00a0150 of that regulation, when calculating administrative fines in respect of the infringements referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) of the GDPR, the concept of an \u2018undertaking\u2019, within the meaning of Articles\u00a0101 and 102 TFEU.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the first question must be that Article\u00a058(2)(i) and Article\u00a083(1) to (6) of the GDPR must be interpreted as precluding national legislation under which an administrative fine may be imposed on a legal person in its capacity as controller in respect of an infringement referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) only in so far as that infringement has previously been attributed to an identified natural person.\n\u00a0\nThe second question \n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, which is asked in the event that the first question is answered in the affirmative, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a083 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that an administrative fine may be imposed pursuant to that provision only where it is established that the controller, which is both a legal person and an undertaking, intentionally or negligently committed an infringement referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) of the GDPR.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that it is apparent from Article\u00a083(1) of the GDPR that administrative fines must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. However, Article\u00a083 of the GDPR does not expressly state that the infringements referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) thereof may be penalised by such a fine only if they were committed intentionally or, at the very least, negligently.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The German, Estonian and Norwegian Governments and the Council of the European Union infer therefrom, inter alia, that the EU legislature intended to leave a certain discretion to the Member States in the implementation of Article\u00a083 of the GDPR, allowing them to provide for administrative fines to be imposed pursuant to that provision, as appropriate, without it being established that the infringement of the GDPR penalised by that fine was committed intentionally or negligently.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An interpretation of that nature in respect of Article\u00a083 of the GDPR cannot be accepted.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as has been observed in paragraphs\u00a045 and 48 of the present judgment, the substantive conditions which a supervisory authority must satisfy when it imposes an administrative fine on a controller are governed solely by EU law, since those conditions are laid down, in detail and without leaving any discretion to the Member States, in Article\u00a083(1) to (6) of the GDPR (see also judgment of 5\u00a0December 2023, \nNacionalinis visuomen\u0117s sveikatos centras\n, C-683/21, EU:C:2023:XXX, paragraphs\u00a064 to 70).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards those conditions, it should be noted that Article\u00a083(2) of the GDPR lists the factors to which the supervisory authority is to have regard when imposing an administrative fine on the controller. Those factors include, in Article\u00a083(2)(b) thereof, \u2018the intentional or negligent character of the infringement\u2019. By contrast, none of the factors listed in Article\u00a083(2) of the GDPR mentions any possibility that the controller will incur liability in the absence of wrongful conduct on its part.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Article\u00a083(2) of the GDPR must be read in conjunction with Article\u00a083(3) thereof, the purpose of which is to lay down the consequences of cumulative infringements of that regulation, according to which \u2018if a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked processing operations, infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement\u2019.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it follows from the wording of Article\u00a083(2) of the GDPR that only infringements of the provisions of that regulation committed wrongfully by the controller, that is to say those committed intentionally or negligently, can result in a fine being imposed on the controller pursuant to that article.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The general scheme and purpose of the GDPR support that reading.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the EU legislature has laid down a system of penalties enabling the supervisory authorities to impose the penalties which are the most appropriate according to the circumstances of each case.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, Article\u00a058(2)(i) of the GDPR provides that those authorities may impose administrative fines, pursuant to Article\u00a083 of that regulation, \u2018in addition to, or instead\u2019 of the other corrective powers listed in Article\u00a058(2), such as warnings, reprimands or orders. Similarly, recital\u00a0148 of the GDPR states, inter alia, that the supervisory authorities, where dealing with a minor infringement or if the administrative fine likely to be imposed would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person, the supervisory authorities are permitted to refrain from imposing an administrative fine and, instead, to issue a reprimand.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as has been stated in paragraph\u00a050 of the present judgment, the objectives of the provisions of the GDPR are, inter alia, to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data within the European Union and, to that end, to ensure consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of those persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union. In addition, in order to ensure consistent application of the GDPR, supervisory authorities must have equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data, so that they can impose equivalent sanctions where that regulation is infringed.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The existence of a system of penalties making it possible to impose, where justified by the specific circumstances of each individual case, an administrative fine pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the GDPR creates an incentive for controllers and processors to comply with that regulation. Through their deterrent effect, administrative fines contribute to strengthening the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and therefore constitute a key element in ensuring respect for the rights of those persons, in accordance with the purpose of that regulation of ensuring a high level of protection of such persons with regard to the processing of personal data.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the EU legislature did not find it necessary, in order to ensure such a high level of protection, to provide for administrative fines to be imposed in the absence of wrongdoing. In view of the fact that the GDPR aims for a level of protection which is both equivalent and homogeneous, and that it must, to that end, be applied consistently throughout the European Union, it would be contrary to that purpose to allow Member States to provide for such a system for the imposition of a fine under Article\u00a083 of the GDPR. Such a freedom of choice would, additionally, be liable to distort competition between economic operators within the European Union, which would run counter to the stated objectives of the EU legislature, in particular, those in recitals\u00a09 and 13 of that regulation.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it must be observed that Article\u00a083 of the GDPR does not allow an administrative fine to be imposed in respect of an infringement referred to in paragraphs\u00a04 to 6 thereof, without it being established that that infringement was committed intentionally or negligently by the controller and that, consequently, a culpable infringement constitutes a condition for such a fine to be imposed.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be clarified, as regards the question whether an infringement has been committed intentionally or negligently and is, therefore, liable to be penalised by an administrative fine pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the GDPR, that a controller can be penalised for conduct falling within the scope of the GDPR where that controller could not be unaware of the infringing nature of its conduct, whether or not it is aware that it is infringing the provisions of the GDPR (see, by analogy, judgments of 18\u00a0June 2013, \nSchenker & Co. and Others\n, C-681/11, EU:C:2013:404, paragraph\u00a037 and the case-law cited; of 25\u00a0March 2021, \nLundbeck\n v \nCommission\n, C-591/16\u00a0P, EU:C:2021:243, paragraph\u00a0156; and of 25\u00a0March 2021, \nArrow Group and Arrow Generics\n v \nCommission\n, C-601/16\u00a0P, EU:C:2021:244, paragraph\u00a097).\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the controller is a legal person, it should also be clarified that for Article\u00a083 GDPR to apply, it is not necessary for there to have been action by or even knowledge on the part of the management body of that legal person (see, by analogy, judgments of 7\u00a0June 1983, \nMusique Diffusion fran\u00e7aise and Others\n v \nCommission\n, 100/80 to 103/80, EU:C:1983:158, paragraph\u00a097, and of 16\u00a0February 2017, \nTudapetrol Mineral\u00f6lerzeugnisse Nils Hansen\n v \nCommission\n, C-94/15\u00a0P, EU:C:2017:124, paragraph\u00a028 and the case-law cited).\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the foregoing, the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a083 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that an administrative fine may be imposed pursuant to that provision only where it is established that the controller, which is both a legal person and an undertaking, intentionally or negligently committed an infringement referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) thereof.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a058(2)(i) and Article\u00a083(1) to (6) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) \nmust be interpreted as precluding national legislation under which an administrative fine may be imposed on a legal person in its capacity as controller in respect of an infringement referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) only in so far as that infringement has previously been attributed to an identified natural person.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a083 of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that an administrative fine may be imposed pursuant to that provision only where it is established that the controller, which is both a legal person and an undertaking, intentionally or negligently committed an infringement referred to in Article\u00a083(4) to (6) thereof."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The reasons given must include in particular sufficiently precise details as to the facts which give rise to a suspicion that there has been an infringement of rights.

It enforces as trustee the rights of recorded music producers in their worldwide recordings and the rights of the recording artists in respect of the exploitation of those recordings in Austria. The rights concerned are, in particular, the right to reproduce and distribute the recordings and the right to make them available to the public.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tele2 is an Internet access provider which assigns to its clients Internet Protocol Addresses (\u2018IP addresses\u2019), which are most often dynamic rather than static. Tele2 is able to identify individual clients on the basis of the IP address and the period or date when it was assigned.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The holders of the rights defended by LSG suffer financial loss as a result of the creation of file-sharing systems which make it possible for participants to exchange copies of saved data. In order to be able to bring civil proceedings against the perpetrators, LSG applied for an order requiring Tele2 to send it the names and addresses of the persons to whom it had provided an Internet access service and whose IP addresses, together with the day and time of the connection, were known. Tele2 took the view that it was obliged to refuse that request for information. It stated that it is not an intermediary and is not authorised to save access data.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By judgment of 21\u00a0June\u00a02006, the Handelsgericht Wien (Commercial Court, Vienna) granted LSG\u2019s application, on the view that, as an Internet access provider, Tele2 is an intermediary within the meaning of Paragraph\u00a081(1a) of the Austrian Federal Law on Copyright and that, as such, it is required to provide the information referred to in Paragraph\u00a087b(3) thereof.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the order for reference, the decision at first instance was confirmed on appeal by the Oberlandesgericht Wien (Higher Regional Court, Vienna) by judgment of 12\u00a0April\u00a02007, in respect of which an appeal on a point of law has been brought before the Oberster Gerichtshof (Austrian Supreme Court).\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the Oberster Gerichtshof, Tele2 claims, first, that it is not an intermediary within the meaning of Paragraph\u00a081(1a) of the Austrian Federal Law on Copyright or Article\u00a08(3) of Directive\u00a02001/29, since, as Internet access provider, it indeed enables the user to access the Internet, but it exercises no control, whether \nde iure\n or \nde facto\n, over the services which the user makes use of. Secondly, the tensions in the relationship between the right to information entailed by the legal protection of copyright and the limits placed by data protection laws on the saving and disclosure of personal data have been resolved, in favour of data protection, by the Community directives. \n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Oberster Gerichtshof is of the view that the Opinion of the Advocate General in Case C-275/06\u00a0\nPromusicae\n [2008] ECR\u00a0I-271, delivered after the present order for reference, raises doubts as to whether the right to information conferred by Paragraph\u00a087b(3) of the Austrian Federal Law on Copyright, read in conjunction with Paragraph\u00a081(1a) thereof, is in conformity with the directives adopted in the data protection field and, in particular, with Articles\u00a05, 6 and 15 of Directive\u00a02002/58. The aforementioned provisions of Austrian law require private third parties to be provided with information on personal data relating to Internet traffic, thereby imposing a duty to disclose, which presupposes that the Internet traffic data have first been processed and saved.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Oberster Gerichtshof decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the term \u201cintermediary\u201d in Article\u00a05(1)(a) and Article\u00a08(3) of Directive\u00a0[2001/29] to be interpreted as including an access provider who merely provides a user with access to the network by allocating him a dynamic IP address but does not himself provide him with any services such as email, FTP or file-sharing services and does not exercise any control, whether \nde iure\n or \nde facto\n, over the services which the user makes use of?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the first question is answered in the affirmative:\nIs Article\u00a08(3) of Directive\u00a0[2004/48], regard being had to Article\u00a06 and Article\u00a015 of Directive\u00a0[2002/58], to be interpreted (restrictively) as not permitting the disclosure of personal traffic data to private third parties for the purposes of civil proceedings for alleged infringements of exclusive rights protected by copyright (rights of exploitation and use)?\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a0104(3) of the Rules of Procedure \u2013 that is to say, inter alia, where the answer to a question referred to the Court for a preliminary ruling may be clearly deduced from existing case-law or where the answer to the question admits of no reasonable doubt \u2013 the Court may give its decision by reasoned order.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, which it is appropriate to consider first, the national court essentially asks whether Community law, in particular Article\u00a08(3) of Directive\u00a02004/48, read in conjunction with Articles 6 and 15 of Directive\u00a02002/58, precludes Member States from imposing an obligation to disclose to private third parties personal data relating to Internet traffic in order to enable them to bring civil proceedings for copyright infringements.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reply to that question can be clearly inferred from the case-law of the Court.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In paragraph\u00a053 of \nPromusicae\n, the Court stated that the exceptions provided for in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive\u00a02002/58, which refers expressly to Article\u00a013(1) of Directive\u00a095/46, include measures which are necessary for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. As it does not specify the rights and freedoms covered by that exception, Directive\u00a02002/58 must be interpreted as reflecting the intention of the Community legislature not to exclude from its scope the protection of the right to property or situations in which authors seek to obtain that protection through civil proceedings. \n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court inferred from this, in paragraphs\u00a054 and 55 of \nPromusicae\n, that Directive\u00a02002/58 \u2013 in particular, Article\u00a015(1) thereof \u2013 does not preclude the Member States from imposing an obligation to disclose personal data in the context of civil proceedings, nor does it oblige them to impose such an obligation.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the Court pointed out that the freedom which Member States retain to give priority to the right to privacy or to the right to property is qualified by a number of requirements. Accordingly, when transposing Directives\u00a02000/31, 2001/29, 2002/58 and 2004/48 into national law, it is for the Member States to ensure that they rely on an interpretation of those directives which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order. Furthermore, when applying the measures transposing those directives, the authorities and courts of Member States must not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with those directives, but must also make sure that they do not rely on an interpretation of those directives which would conflict with those fundamental rights or with the other general principles of Community law, such as the principle of proportionality (\nPromusicae\n, paragraph\u00a070). \n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the answer to the second question is that Community law \u2013 in particular, Article\u00a08(3) of Directive\u00a02004/48, read in conjunction with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive\u00a02002/58 \u2013 does not preclude Member States from imposing an obligation to disclose to private third parties personal data relating to Internet traffic in order to enable them to bring civil proceedings for copyright infringements. Community law nevertheless requires Member States to ensure that, when transposing Directives\u00a02000/31, 2001/29, 2002/58 and 2004/48 into national law, they rely on an interpretation of those directives which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights involved. Moreover, when applying the measures transposing those directives, the authorities and courts of Member States must not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with those directives, but must also make sure that they do not rely on an interpretation of those directives which would conflict with those fundamental rights or with the other general principles of Community law, such as the principle of proportionality.\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the national court asks, essentially, whether access providers which merely provide users with Internet access, without offering other services or exercising any control, whether \nde iure\n or \nde facto\n, over the services which users make use of, are \u2018intermediaries\u2019 within the meaning of Articles\u00a05(1)(a) and 8(3) of Directive\u00a02001/29.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the view that the answer to that question admits of no reasonable doubt, the Court informed the national court, in accordance with the second paragraph\u00a0of Article\u00a0104(3) of the Rules of Procedure, that it proposed to give its decision by reasoned order, and called on the interested parties referred to in Article\u00a023 of the Statute of the Court of Justice to submit any observations they might have in that regard.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LSG, the Spanish and United Kingdom Governments and the Commission of the European Communities indicated to the Court that they had no objection to the Court\u2019s proposal to give its decision by reasoned order.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tele2 confines its observations in that regard, essentially, to those matters already raised in its written pleadings. According to Tele2, Community law accords Internet access providers privileged treatment, in terms of liability, which is incompatible with an unlimited obligation to disclose information. However, those arguments are not such as to lead the Court to rule out the procedural route envisaged.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows clearly both from the order for reference and from the wording of the questions referred that, by its first question, the national court wishes to know whether Internet access providers who merely enable the user to access the Internet may be required to provide the information referred to in the second question.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, it should be pointed out that Article\u00a05(1)(a) of Directive\u00a02001/29 requires Member States to provide for exemptions from reproduction rights.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The point at issue in the dispute before the referring court is whether LSG can rely on a right to information as against Tele2, not whether Tele2 has infringed reproduction rights.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that an interpretation of Article\u00a05(1)(a) of Directive\u00a02001/29 serves no purpose in relation to the outcome of the dispute before the referring court.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tele2 maintains, inter alia, that intermediaries must be in a position to bring copyright infringements to an end. Internet access providers, on the other hand, in as much as they exercise no control, whether \nde iure\n or \nde facto\n, over the services accessed by the user, are not capable of bringing such infringements to an end and, accordingly, are not \u2018intermediaries\u2019 within the meaning of Directive\u00a02001/29. \n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted at the outset that \nPromusicae\n concerned the communication by Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a SAU \u2013 a commercial undertaking engaged, inter alia, in the provision of Internet access services \u2013 of the identities and physical addresses of certain persons to whom it provided such services and whose IP addresses and dates and times of connection were known (\nPromusicae\n, paragraphs\u00a029 and 30).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is common ground, as is apparent from the question referred and from the facts in \nPromusicae\n, that Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a SAU was an Internet access provider (\nPromusicae\n, paragraphs\u00a030 and 34).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, in holding \u2013 in paragraph\u00a070 of \nPromusicae\n \u2013 that Directives\u00a02000/31, 2001/29, 2002/58 and 2004/48 do not require the Member States to impose, in a situation such as that in \nPromusicae\n, an obligation to communicate personal data in order to ensure effective protection of copyright in the context of civil proceedings, the Court did not immediately rule out the possibility that Member States may, pursuant to Article\u00a08(1) of Directive\u00a02004/48, place Internet access providers under a duty of disclosure.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be pointed out that, under Article\u00a08(3) of Directive\u00a02001/29, Member States are to ensure that rightholders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Access providers who merely enable clients to access the Internet, even without offering other services or exercising any control, whether \nde iure\n or \nde facto\n, over the services which users make use of, provide a service capable of being used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right, inasmuch as those access providers supply the user with the connection enabling him to infringe such rights.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, according to Recital\u00a059 in the preamble to Directive\u00a02001/29, rightholders should have the possibility of applying for an injunction against an intermediary who \u2018carries a third party\u2019s infringement of a protected work or other subject-matter in a network\u2019. It is common ground that access providers, in granting access to the Internet, make it possible for such unauthorised material to be transmitted between a subscriber to that service and a third party.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is borne out by the aim of Directive\u00a02001/29 which, as is apparent in particular from Article\u00a01(1) thereof, seeks to ensure the legal protection of copyright and related rights in the framework of the internal market. The protection sought by Directive\u00a02001/29 would be substantially diminished if \u2018intermediaries\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a08(3) of that directive, were to be construed as not covering\u00a0access providers, which alone are in possession of the data making it possible to identify the users who have infringed those rights.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that access providers which merely provide users with Internet access, without offering other services such as email, FTP or file-sharing services or exercising any control, whether \nde iure\n or \nde facto\n, over the services which users make use of, must be regarded as \u2018intermediaries\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a08(3) of Directive\u00a02001/29.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. \nOn those grounds, the Court (Eighth Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCommunity law \u2013 in particular, Article\u00a08(3) of Directive\u00a02004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, read in conjunction with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive\u00a02002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive\u00a0on privacy and electronic communications) \u2013 does not preclude Member States from imposing an obligation to disclose to private third parties personal data relating to Internet traffic in order to enable them to bring civil proceedings for copyright infringements. Community law nevertheless requires Member States to ensure that, when transposing into national law Directive\u00a02000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (\u2018Directive\u00a0on electronic commerce\u2019), Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, and Directives 2002/58 and 2004/48, they rely on an interpretation of those directives which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights involved. Moreover, when applying the measures transposing those directives, the authorities and courts of Member States must not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with those directives but must also make sure that they do not rely on an interpretation of those directives which would conflict with those fundamental rights or with the other general principles of Community law, such as the principle of proportionality.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAccess providers which merely provide users with Internet access, without offering other services such as email, FTP or file-sharing services or exercising any control, whether \nde iure\n or \nde facto\n, over the services which users make use of, must be regarded as \u2018intermediaries\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a08(3) of Directive\u00a02001/29."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 8 Dec 2022, C-180/21 (\nInspektor v Inspektorata kam Visshia sadeben

The applicant in the main proceedings, VS, took part in those proceedings as a victim of that criminal offence.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2016, following a number of complaints concerning, inter alia, VS, the District Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Petrich, compiled a number of files containing information relating to that person, but did not open any pre-trial proceedings in the absence of evidence that a criminal offence had been committed.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2018, in the context of pre-trial proceedings No\u00a0252/2013, the public prosecutor made formal accusations in respect of all the persons who took part in the incident at issue in those proceedings, including VS. \n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In civil proceedings, VS brought an action before the Okrazhen sad Blagoevgrad (Regional Court, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria) against the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Republic of Bulgaria seeking damages for the harm allegedly resulting from the excessive duration of pre-trial proceedings No\u00a0252/2013. At the hearing on 15\u00a0October 2018, for the purposes of defending that public prosecutor\u2019s office, a public prosecutor of the District Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Petrich, representing the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, requested that the files opened by that public prosecutor\u2019s office in 2016, referred to in paragraph\u00a028 of this judgment, be produced in the context of that action. It is apparent from the order for reference that that public prosecutor thus intended to demonstrate that the health problems relied on by the applicant in the main proceedings were not, as he claimed, attributable to those pre-trial proceedings, but had been caused by the checks carried out by the police and by the District Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Petrich, in connection with those files. At the same hearing, the Okrazhen sad Blagoevgrad (Regional Court, Blagoevgrad) ordered that public prosecutor\u2019s office to produce certified copies of the documents in the files in question, which the public prosecutor of that public prosecutor\u2019s office then did.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 12\u00a0March 2020, VS lodged a complaint with the IVSS, claiming that the District Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Petrich, had infringed the provisions relating to the protection of personal data. By his first claim, he submitted that that public prosecutor\u2019s office had unlawfully used his personal data, which had been collected when he was considered to be a victim of a criminal offence, in order to prosecute him in the same proceedings and in respect of the same acts. By his second claim, he alleged that the public prosecutor\u2019s office acted unlawfully as regards the processing of personal data that were collected in the files referred to in paragraph\u00a028 of this judgment, in the context of his action for damages against the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Republic of Bulgaria. By decision of 22\u00a0June 2020, the IVSS rejected that complaint.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 31\u00a0July 2020, VS brought an action before the referring court against that decision, claiming, first, that the processing of his personal data in the course of pre-trial proceedings No\u00a0252/2013 is contrary to, inter alia, the principles of Directive 2016/680, and second, that the processing of the data collected in the files referred to in paragraph\u00a028 of this judgment, after the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office had refused to initiate pre-trial proceedings, infringes the principles of the GDPR.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking the view, in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law, that the dispute in the main proceedings concerns the processing of personal data in the context of activities coming within the scope of the GDPR and Directive 2016/680, the referring court has doubts as to the limits laid down by EU law concerning the subsequent processing of personal data that were initially collected by the controller for the purposes of the investigation and detection of a criminal offence.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, first, the referring court has doubts whether, in the event that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Republic of Bulgaria, as a \u2018competent authority\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a03(7)(a) of Directive 2016/680, and as a \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a03(8) of that directive, has collected, for the purposes of the investigation and detection of a criminal offence, personal data relating to a person who was considered to be a victim at the time of that collection, the subsequent processing of those data by the same authority for the purposes of the prosecution of that person serves a purpose that comes within the scope of that directive but that is other than that for which the data in question was collected, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of that directive.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the referring court states that the reference, in the context of the action for damages brought by VS, to the information relating to that person contained in the files opened in 2016 by the District Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Petrich, serves a different purpose from that for which that information was collected and states that, in the context of that action, the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, as defendant, is not acting for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences. However, the referring court has doubts whether the mere fact of indicating to the civil court having jurisdiction that those files concern VS and of transmitting to it that information in full or in part constitutes \u2018processing\u2019 of \u2018personal data\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) and (2) of the GDPR, coming within the scope of that regulation, in accordance with Article\u00a02(1) thereof.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the referring court considers, in essence, that the dispute in the main proceedings raises the question of reconciling the protection of personal data and the rights of a party to judicial proceedings, where those data have been collected by that party in its capacity as controller within the meaning of Article\u00a03(8) of Directive 2016/680, in particular in the light of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR relating to the necessity of processing for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by that controller. \n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court considers that the other grounds for lawfulness of the processing of personal data coming within the scope of the GDPR, which are set out in the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, are not relevant in the dispute in the main proceedings. In particular, according to that court, the provision, for the purposes of its defence in civil proceedings, by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office to the court having jurisdiction of information relating to the criminal files opened by it is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest and is not covered by the exercise of official authority within the meaning of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Administrativen sad\u00a0\u2013 Blagoevgrad (Administrative Court, Blagoevgrad) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a01(1) of [Directive 2016/680] to be interpreted as meaning that, when stating the objectives of that directive, the terms \u201cprevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences [or the execution of criminal penalties]\u201d are listed as aspects of a general objective?\n(2)(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are the provisions of [the GDPR] applicable to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Republic of Bulgaria in view of the fact that information concerning a person, which was collected by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, in its capacity as \u201ccontroller\u201d pursuant to point\u00a08 of Article\u00a03 of [Directive 2016/680], in an investigation file opened in relation to that person with a view to verifying indications of a criminal offence, was used in the context of the judicial defence of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office as a party to civil proceedings\u00a0\u2013 by virtue of the fact that the circumstance of that file having been opened was revealed or that the contents of the file were presented?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If that question is answered in the affirmative: Is the expression \u201clegitimate interests\u201d in [point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR] to be interpreted as including the disclosure, in whole or in part, of information concerning a person which has been collected in a public prosecution investigation file opened in relation to that person for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, in the case where that disclosure is carried out for the purposes of the defence of the controller as a party to civil proceedings, and does that expression exclude the consent of the data subject?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, even if the referring court formally confined its first question to the interpretation of Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, that circumstance does not prevent the Court from providing it with all the elements of interpretation which may be useful for the judgment in the main proceedings, by extracting from the body of material provided by that court, and in particular from the statement of reasons for the order for reference, the elements of EU law which require interpretation in the light of the subject matter of the dispute (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0April 2021, \nProfi Credit Slovakia\n, C-485/19, EU:C:2021:313, paragraph\u00a050 and the case-law cited).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, by its first question, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain (i) whether Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, read in conjunction with Article\u00a04(2) and Article\u00a06 thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data serves a purpose other than that for which those data were collected, where such data were collected for the purposes of the detection and investigation of a criminal offence and the data subject was, at the time of that collection, considered to be a victim, but that processing is carried out for the purpose of prosecuting that person following the conclusion of the criminal investigation at issue, and, (ii) as the case may be, whether that processing is permitted.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to settled case-law, it is necessary, for the interpretation of a provision of EU law, that account be taken not only of its wording, but also of its context and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part. The origins of a provision of EU law may also provide information relevant to its interpretation (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2019, \nPlanet49\n, C-673/17, EU:C:2019:801, paragraph\u00a048 and the case-law cited).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it must be noted, first of all, that the wording of Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, which relates to the subject matter of that directive, expressly distinguishes between different categories of activities whose purposes the processing of the relevant personal data may serve. In that regard, it is apparent from the various language versions of that provision, in particular those in Bulgarian, Spanish, German, Greek, English and Italian, that the different purposes referred to in Article\u00a01(1) of that directive correspond to the \u2018prevention\u2019, \u2018detection\u2019, \u2018investigation\u2019 and \u2018prosecution\u2019 of criminal offences and \u2018the execution of criminal penalties\u2019, including the \u2018safeguarding\u2019 against \u2018threats to public security\u2019 and the \u2018prevention\u2019 of such threats.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, the wording of Article\u00a04(2) of that directive, which states that processing for \u2018any of the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) [thereof] other than that for which the personal data are collected\u2019 is to be permitted, subject to compliance with the requirements laid down by that provision, expressly confirms that the terms listed in Article\u00a01(1), namely \u2018prevention\u2019, \u2018investigation\u2019, \u2018detection\u2019 \u2018prosecution\u2019, \u2018execution of criminal penalties\u2019, \u2018safeguarding against [threats to public security]\u2019 and \u2018the prevention of threats to public security\u2019 concern several separate purposes of the processing of personal data coming within the scope of that directive.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It can thus be inferred from the very wording of Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, read in conjunction with Article\u00a04(2) thereof, that, where personal data have been collected for the purposes of the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018investigation\u2019 of a criminal offence and have subsequently been processed for the purposes of \u2018prosecution\u2019, that collection and that processing serve different purposes.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, it must be observed that, under Article\u00a06 of that directive, Member States are under an obligation to provide for the controller, where applicable and as far as possible, to make a clear distinction between personal data of different categories of data subjects, such as, inter alia, those referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of that article, namely, respectively, persons with regard to whom there are serious grounds for believing that they have committed or are about to commit a criminal offence, persons convicted of a criminal offence, and victims of a criminal offence or persons with regard to whom certain facts give rise to reasons for believing that he or she could be the victim of a criminal offence.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, a person whose personal data are processed for the purposes of criminal prosecution must be regarded as coming within the category of persons with regard to whom there are serious grounds for believing that they have committed a criminal offence, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(a) of Directive 2016/680. It follows that, if, as in the situation referred to in the first question, that person had initially been considered to be a victim of a criminal offence, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(c) of that directive, that processing therefore reflects a change in that person\u2019s category, which it is for the controller to take into account in accordance with the requirement laid down in that article to make a clear distinction between data of different categories of persons.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, it must be stated that neither Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680 nor Article\u00a04(2) thereof refers to Article\u00a06 of that directive or to its content in order to lay down the purpose of the processing of personal data coming within the scope of that directive.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point\u00a062 of his Opinion, the expression \u2018where applicable and as far as possible\u2019, used in Article\u00a06 of Directive 2016/680, clearly indicates that it is not necessarily possible to draw a clear distinction between such data, in particular where, as in the present case, those data are collected for the purposes of an \u2018investigation\u2019 or \u2018detection\u2019 of a criminal offence, since the same person may come within several categories of persons as referred to in Article\u00a06 of that directive and the determination of the categories concerned might change in the course of the pre-trial proceedings, in accordance with the gradual clarification of the facts at issue.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be inferred from this that Article\u00a06 lays down an obligation that is separate from that laid down in Article\u00a04(2) and, as the Advocate General noted in points\u00a061 to 64 of his Opinion, that obligation is not relevant for the purpose of determining whether the processing of personal data serves a purpose other than that for which those data were collected, within the meaning of that provision.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards the context of the legislation at issue, it should be noted that Article\u00a04(1)(b) and (c) of Directive 2016/680 provides, first, that personal data must be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not be processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes, and second, that those data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. Those two requirements are set out, in essence, in the same terms in Article\u00a05(1)(b) and (c) of the GDPR, which states that they correspond to the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation, respectively.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, it must be observed that Article\u00a04(2) of that directive, in the light of recital\u00a029 thereof, authorises subsequent processing of personal data for a purpose other than that for which those data were collected, where that purpose is among those set out in Article\u00a01(1) of that directive and that processing satisfies the two conditions laid down in Article\u00a04(2)(a) and (b). First, the controller must be authorised to process such personal data for such a purpose in accordance with EU or Member State law. Second, processing must be necessary and proportionate to that other purpose.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, personal data collected for the purposes of the \u2018prevention\u2019 and \u2018detection\u2019 or \u2018investigation\u2019 of criminal offences may be processed subsequently, where appropriate, by different competent authorities, for the purposes of \u2018prosecution\u2019 or the \u2018execution of criminal penalties\u2019, where a criminal offence has been identified and consequently calls for law enforcement action.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in the context of the collection of personal data for the purposes of the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018investigation\u2019 of criminal offences, the competent authorities are required to gather any data that are potentially relevant to the determination of the acts constituting the criminal offence at issue at a stage where those acts have not yet been established. By contrast, in the context of the processing of personal data for the purposes of \u2018prosecution\u2019, those data aim to establish that the acts attributed to the accused persons have sufficient probative value and that the classification of those acts under criminal law is accurate, in order to enable the court having jurisdiction to give a ruling.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, first, personal data necessary for the purposes of the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018investigation\u2019 of a criminal offence will not be systematically necessary for the purposes of \u2018prosecution\u2019. Second, the consequences of the processing of personal data for the data subjects might be substantially different, as regards, in particular, the degree of interference with their right to the protection of those data and the effects of that processing on their legal situation in the criminal proceedings in question.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it should be noted that the scope of Article\u00a04(2) is not limited to the processing of personal data in connection with the same criminal offence as that warranting the collection of those data. As stated in recital\u00a027 of Directive 2016/680, that directive takes account of the need for the authorities responsible for combating criminal offences to process personal data for a purpose other than that which led to the collection of those data, in particular with the aim of developing an understanding of criminal activities and of making links between different criminal offences detected.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that, in order to meet the requirements referred to in Article\u00a04(2)(a) and (b) of Directive 2016/680, the assessment of compliance with those requirements in the processing, by the same or by another controller, of personal data for one of the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1), other than that for which those data were collected, must be carried out by regarding each of the purposes referred to in Article\u00a01(1) as specific and distinct.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, as regards the objectives of the legislation at issue, it should be noted that, as is apparent from recitals\u00a010 and 11 of Directive 2016/680, the EU legislature sought to adopt rules which take account of the specific nature of the field covered by that directive. \n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, recital\u00a012 states that the activities carried out by the police or other law-enforcement authorities are focused mainly on the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, including police activities without prior knowledge if an incident is a criminal offence or not.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from this that the EU legislature sought to adopt rules corresponding to the specific features which characterise the activities carried out by the competent authorities in the field governed by that directive, while taking account of the fact that they constitute distinct activities serving purposes specific to them.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This interpretation, in the light of the context of the provision at issue and the objectives pursued by the legislation of which it is part, is borne out by its origins, in particular by the statement of the Council\u2019s reasons concerning Council Position (EU) No\u00a05/2016 at first reading with a view to the adoption of a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (OJ 2016 C\u00a0158, p.\u00a046). In that statement of reasons, the Council explains the insertion of that provision into Directive 2016/680 by stating that it \u2018enables, for example, [a] prosecutor to process the same personal data for the prosecution of a crime, as the police did for the detection of a crime given that both purposes in the example are covered by Article\u00a01(1) [of that directive]\u2019.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is therefore for the referring court to determine, with a view to resolving the dispute in the main proceedings, whether the processing of personal data concerning VS by the District Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Petrich, for the purpose of prosecuting that person, could be permitted in the light of the conditions laid down in Article\u00a04(2) of Directive 2016/680, by ascertaining, first, whether that authority was authorised under Bulgarian criminal law to carry out that processing and, second, whether that processing was necessary and proportionate to its purpose.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, for the purpose of assessing whether that processing is necessary and proportionate, the referring court may, where appropriate, take account of the fact that the authority responsible for that prosecution must be in a position to rely on the data collected during that investigation as evidence of the acts constituting the offence, in particular those relating to the persons involved therein, provided that those data are necessary to identify those persons and to establish their involvement.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, read in conjunction with Article\u00a04(2) and Article\u00a06 thereof, must be interpreted as meaning (i) that the processing of personal data serves a purpose other than that for which those data were collected, where such data were collected for the purposes of the detection and investigation of a criminal offence, but that processing is carried out for the purpose of prosecuting a person following the conclusion of the criminal investigation at issue, irrespective of the fact that that person was considered to be a victim at the time of that collection, and (ii) that such processing is permitted pursuant to Article\u00a04(2) of that directive, provided that it meets the conditions laid down in that provision.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, first, whether Article\u00a03(8) and Article\u00a09(1) and (2) of Directive 2016/680 and Article\u00a02(1) and (2) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that that regulation is applicable to the processing of personal data by the public prosecutor\u2019s office of a Member State for the purpose of exercising its rights of defence in an action for damages against the State, where it informs the court having jurisdiction of the existence of files concerning a natural person who is a party to that action, opened for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of that directive, and transmits those files to that court and, second, if that question were to be answered in the affirmative, whether point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation must be interpreted as meaning that such processing of personal data may be regarded as lawful for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller, within the meaning of that provision.\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its written observations, the IVSS disputes the admissibility of the second question on the ground that it was raised by the referring court in the context of the examination of a claim put forward by VS which had been rejected as inadmissible by the decision that is the subject matter of the dispute in the main proceedings, on account of the expiry of the statutory time limit for raising it.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, questions on the interpretation of EU law referred by a national court in the factual and legislative context which that court is responsible for defining, and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court to determine, enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought is unrelated to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (see, to that effect, judgment of 27\u00a0September 2017, \nPu\u0161k\u00e1r\n, C-73/16, EU:C:2017:725, paragraph\u00a050 and the case-law cited).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it should be noted, as the Advocate General observed in points\u00a076 and 77 of his Opinion, that the matter of the admissibility of the claims raised by VS in his complaint before the IVSS comes entirely within the jurisdiction of the referring court. Moreover, in the order for reference, that court stated that it considered the second question to be relevant, notwithstanding IVSS\u2019 rejection of the claim referred to in paragraph\u00a065 of this judgment as inadmissible. It is not, in any event, for the Court of Justice to re-examine that assessment.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the second question is admissible.\n\u00a0\nSubstance\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe application of the GDPR to the processing of personal data by the public prosecutor\u2019s office of a Member State for the purpose of exercising its rights of defence in an action for damages against the State\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it is necessary to determine whether the use, by the public prosecutor\u2019s office of a Member State, of information concerning a natural person that it has collected and processed for purposes coming within the scope of Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, with a view to exercising its rights of defence in civil proceedings, constitutes \u2018processing\u2019 of \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) and (2) of the GDPR.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, it must be borne in mind that \u2018personal data\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR, means \u2018any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019, it being understood that, according to the case-law, that definition is applicable where, by reason of its content, purpose and effect, the information in question is linked to a particular person (see, to that effect, judgment of 20\u00a0December 2017, \nNowak\n, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraph\u00a035). Furthermore, under Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR, the concept of \u2018processing\u2019 is defined as \u2018any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means\u2019 such as, inter alia, \u2018consultation\u2019, \u2018use\u2019, \u2018disclosure by transmission\u2019, \u2018dissemination\u2019 or \u2018otherwise making available\u2019. Those definitions reflect the aim of the EU legislature to assign a broad scope to those two concepts (see, to that effect, judgments of 20\u00a0December 2017, \nNowak\n, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraph\u00a034, and of 24\u00a0February 2022, \nValsts ie\u0146\u0113mumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)\n, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraph\u00a035).\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, first, the fact that the defendant in civil proceedings informs the court having jurisdiction, even succinctly, in its written pleadings or at the hearing, of the opening of files concerning the natural person who has brought those proceedings, in particular for the purposes of the \u2018detection\u2019 or \u2018investigation\u2019 of a criminal offence, means that that defendant \u2018consulted\u2019, \u2018used\u2019 and \u2018transmitted\u2019 or \u2018disclosed\u2019 \u2018personal data\u2019 for the purposes of Article\u00a04(1) and (2) of the GDPR. Thus, both in terms of its content and its purpose and effect, that information is linked to a particular person, who is identifiable both by the party that disclosed it and by the court to which it is transmitted.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the fact that that defendant produces, at the request of the court having jurisdiction, files relating to procedures concerning that natural person involves, at the very least, the \u2018use\u2019 and \u2018disclosure by transmission\u2019 of \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) and (2) of the GDPR.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it must be borne in mind that Article\u00a02(1) of the GDPR defines broadly the material scope of that regulation (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a061), which includes any \u2018processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and\u00a0\u2026 the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system\u2019. The corollary of that broad definition is that the exceptions to the application of the GDPR listed in Article\u00a02(2) thereof must be interpreted strictly. That is the case, in particular, with the exception provided for in Article\u00a02(2)(d) which concerns the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0February 2022, \nValsts ie\u0146\u0113mumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)\n, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraphs\u00a040 and 41 and the case-law cited).\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court has held that, as follows from recital\u00a019 of that regulation, the reason for that exception is that the processing of personal data by the competent authorities for the purposes set out in Article\u00a02(2)(d) of the GDPR is governed by a specific EU legal act, namely Directive 2016/680, which was adopted on the same day as the GDPR (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0February 2022, \nValsts ie\u0146\u0113mumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)\n, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraph\u00a042 and the case-law cited).\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from recital\u00a012 of Directive 2016/680, the EU legislature laid down, in Article\u00a09 of that directive, rules relating to the processing of personal data for purposes other than those set out in Article\u00a01(1) of that directive, for which those data were collected.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Article\u00a09(1) of Directive 2016/680 provides, first, that such processing of personal data cannot, in principle, be carried out, unless it is authorised by EU or Member State law and, second, that the GDPR is to apply to that processing, unless the processing is carried out in an activity which falls outside the scope of EU law. Furthermore, under Article\u00a09(2) of that directive, unless the processing is carried out in such an activity, the GDPR is to apply to the processing by the competent authorities in the performance of their tasks other than those performed for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of that directive.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the situations referred to in paragraphs\u00a071 and 72 of this judgment, the collection and processing of personal data by the public prosecutor\u2019s office of a Member State for the purposes of the \u2018prevention\u2019, \u2018detection\u2019, \u2018investigation\u2019 or \u2018prosecution\u2019 of a criminal offence certainly constitute processing of personal data for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, within the meaning of Article\u00a09(1) and (2) of that directive.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, even where the bringing of an action for damages against the State arises from alleged misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor\u2019s office in the course of criminal proceedings, such as, as in the present case, alleged infringements of the right to be tried within a reasonable time, the aim of the State\u2019s defence in such an action is not to perform, as such, that public prosecutor office\u2019s tasks for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in the light of the principle that exceptions to the application of the GDPR must be interpreted strictly, that processing of personal data cannot be regarded as being carried out \u2018in an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR and Article\u00a09(1) and (2) of Directive 2016/680. In that regard, it follows from the case-law that the sole purpose of that expression is to exclude from the scope of the GDPR the processing of personal data carried out by the State authorities in the course of an activity which is intended to safeguard national security or of an activity which can be classified in the same category. The participation of a public authority in civil proceedings as a defendant in an action for damages against the State does not seek to safeguard national security; nor can it be classified in the same category of activities (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraphs\u00a066 to 68 and the case-law cited).\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, it should be noted that, for the purpose of applying the GDPR to the data processing referred to in paragraphs\u00a071 and 72 of this judgment, the public prosecutor\u2019s office must be considered to be a \u2018controller\u2019, within the meaning not only of Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR, but also of Article\u00a03(8) of Directive 2016/680, in that \u2018alone or jointly with others\u2019, it \u2018determines the purposes and means\u2019 of that processing, within the meaning of the latter provision. It is that authority, as a party to the proceedings, which informs the court having jurisdiction of the existence of files opened in criminal matters concerning the other party and which transmits those files to it. Its status as \u2018controller\u2019, having regard to the broad definition of that concept, which seeks to ensure effective and complete protection of data subjects, is independent of the extent of its involvement and its level of responsibility, which may be different from those of the court having jurisdiction, for which it is to authorise or order such processing (see, by analogy, judgment of 29\u00a0July 2019, \nFashion ID\n, C-40/17, EU:C:2019:629, paragraphs\u00a066 to 70).\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Irrespective of whether the data processing referred to in paragraph\u00a080 of this judgment comes within the scope of Article\u00a09(1) or (2) of Directive 2016/680, it is apparent from the wording of those paragraphs and the relationship between them that the GDPR applies to any processing of personal data, collected for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of that directive, for other purposes, unless the processing in question falls outside the scope of EU law, including where the \u2018controller\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(8) of that directive, is a \u2018competent authority\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a03(7)(a) thereof and carries out the processing of personal data in the context of tasks other than those performed for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of that directive.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, it must be held that the GDPR is applicable to the processing of personal data by the public prosecutor\u2019s office of a Member State for the purpose of exercising its rights of defence in an action for damages against the State, where, first, it informs the court having jurisdiction of the opening of files relating to a natural person who is a party to that action for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680 and, second, it transmits those files to that court.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe lawfulness of the processing of personal data by the public prosecutor\u2019s office of a Member State for the purpose of exercising its rights of defence in an action for damages against the State\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be borne in mind that Article\u00a06 of the GDPR lists, in a restrictive manner, the cases in which processing of personal data can be regarded as lawful (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a099).\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those cases include point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, which makes provision for processing that is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, and point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, which refers to processing that is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests or freedoms pursued by the controller or by a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject require the protection of personal data. According to the second subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) thereof is not to apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that, as the Commission correctly stated in its written observations, it is clear from the wording of the second subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR that the processing of personal data by a public authority in the performance of its tasks cannot come within the scope of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, relating to the processing of personal data that is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller. As follows from recital\u00a047 of the GDPR and as the Commission has claimed, that latter provision cannot apply to such data processing, since the legal basis of that processing must be provided for by the legislature. It follows that, where processing by a public authority is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest, and therefore comes within scope of the tasks referred to in the second subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, the application of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR and that of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR are mutually exclusive.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is therefore necessary, before considering the matter of the application of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, to determine whether the processing, by the public prosecutor\u2019s office of a Member State, of personal data initially collected for one or more of the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, for the purpose of defending the State or a public body in an action for damages for harm caused by misconduct on the part of the State or a public body, is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in it, within the meaning of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1). \n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in points\u00a094 and 100 of his Opinion, where it is for the public prosecutor\u2019s office to defend the legal and financial interests of the State in an action for damages which calls into question the acts or conduct of that public authority in its performance of tasks in the public interest with which it is entrusted in criminal matters, the defence of those interests may constitute, pursuant to national law, a task carried out in the public interest within the meaning of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, by exercising the procedural rights that it enjoys as defendant, that public authority preserves the legal certainty of the acts carried out and decisions adopted in the public interest that are being called into question by the applicant. The public authority\u2019s submissions concerning the applicant\u2019s claims and arguments are capable of preventing, as the case may be, the risk that those claims and arguments might undermine the effective application of rules on the part of the public authority in the performance of the tasks concerning which improper performance is alleged.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, by its claims and arguments in defence, that public authority is capable of pointing, where such is the case, to the potentially unfounded or excessive nature of the applicant\u2019s claims for compensation, with a view, in particular, to preventing the performance of the tasks carried out in the public interest that are being called into question in the action for damages from being hindered by the prospect of actions for damages, where those tasks are liable to harm the interests of individuals.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is irrelevant that, in an action for damages against the State, the public prosecutor\u2019s office is, in its capacity as defendant, on an equal footing with the other parties, and does not exercise public powers, as is the case in the performance of its tasks in criminal matters.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference and from the information provided by the Bulgarian Government in response to the questions put by the Court that the action for damages, which is, in part, at the origin of the dispute in the main proceedings, is based on the Law on liability of the State and of municipalities for damage, referred to in paragraph\u00a026 of this judgment, which establishes a system of State liability for harm caused by an infringement of the right to have a case examined and disposed of within a reasonable time, and that, in accordance with Article\u00a07 of that law, it is the party whose unlawful acts, actions or omissions have caused the harm that is to be a party to the dispute and that, on that basis, is to stand in for the State from a procedural point of view.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the role of the authority that caused the harm alleged in such an action for damages is different from that of the defendant in an action for indemnity by the State against the public official who is personally liable on account of shortcomings in the exercise of his or her office, since, in the latter case, that role seeks to defend private interests (see, to that effect, judgment of 18\u00a0May 2021, \nAsocia\u0163ia \u2018Forumul Judec\u0103torilor din Rom\u00e2nia\u2019 and Others\n, C-83/19, C-127/19, C-195/19, C-291/19, C-355/19 and C-397/19, EU:C:2021:393, paragraph\u00a0225).\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in the light of the foregoing considerations, it should be considered that the processing, by the public prosecutor\u2019s office of a Member State, of personal data initially collected and processed for one or more of the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, for the purpose of defending the State in an action for damages for harm caused by misconduct on the part of that public prosecutor\u2019s office in the performance of its tasks, is, in principle, liable to come not within the scope of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR but rather within that of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR.\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it cannot be ruled out that, where, for the purpose of defending the State in an action for damages, the public prosecutor\u2019s office of a Member State transmits personal data to the court having jurisdiction at that court\u2019s request, that transmission is also liable to come within the scope of point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR where, pursuant to the applicable national law, that public prosecutor\u2019s office is required to comply with such a request.\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, for the purpose of establishing that processing of personal data such as that at issue in the main proceedings comes within the scope of the provisions of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, it is for the referring court to verify whether, in accordance with Article\u00a06(3) of that regulation, the national law lays down, first, the basis for such processing and, second, the purposes of that processing or, as regards point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, whether that processing is necessary for the public prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s performance of its task carried out in the public interest.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is, moreover, for the referring court to determine whether the disclosure, by the public prosecutor\u2019s office, of information concerning the person who has brought the action for damages, contained in files opened in cases other than that giving rise to that action, satisfies the other requirements laid down by the GDPR, and in particular the principle of \u2018data minimisation\u2019 referred to in Article\u00a05(1)(c) of the GDPR, according to which personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed, and which gives expression to the principle of proportionality (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a098). In addition, it is for that court to verify that that processing of personal data has been carried out in compliance with the appropriate safeguards, in particular the possibility of effectively submitting comments on the information and evidence provided in that connection by the public prosecutor\u2019s office, but also, in accordance with Article\u00a021(1) of the GDPR, of objecting to the communication of that information and evidence to the court having jurisdiction, subject to the restrictions on that right of objection provided for by national legislation, in accordance with Article\u00a023(1) of that regulation.\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the second question is that:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03(8) and Article\u00a09(1) and (2) of Directive 2016/680 and Article\u00a02(1) and (2) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that that regulation is applicable to the processing of personal data by the public prosecutor\u2019s office of a Member State for the purpose of exercising its rights of defence in an action for damages against the State, where, first, it informs the court having jurisdiction of the opening of files relating to a natural person who is a party to that action for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680 and, second, it transmits those files to that court;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, where an action for damages against the State is based on alleged misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor\u2019s office in the performance of its tasks in criminal matters, such processing of personal data may be regarded as lawful if it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, within the meaning of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, for the purpose of defending the legal and financial interests of the State which falls to the public prosecutor\u2019s office in those proceedings, provided that that processing of personal data complies with all the applicable requirements provided for by that regulation.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a01(1) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA, read in conjunction with Article\u00a04(2) and Article\u00a06 thereof,\nmust be interpreted as meaning that (i) the processing of personal data serves a purpose other than that for which those data were collected, where such data were collected for the purposes of the detection and investigation of a criminal offence, but that processing is carried out for the purpose of prosecuting a person following the conclusion of the criminal investigation at issue, irrespective of the fact that that person was considered to be a victim at the time of that collection, and that (ii) such processing is permitted pursuant to Article\u00a04(2) of that directive, provided that it meets the conditions laid down in that provision.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a03(8) and Article\u00a09(1) and (2) of Directive 2016/680 and Article\u00a02(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\nmust be interpreted as meaning that that regulation is applicable to the processing of personal data by the public prosecutor\u2019s office of a Member State for the purpose of exercising its rights of defence in an action for damages against the State, where, first, it informs the court having jurisdiction of the opening of files relating to a natural person who is a party to that action for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680 and, second, it transmits those files to that court. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that where an action for damages against the State is based on alleged misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor\u2019s office in the performance of its tasks in criminal matters, such processing of personal data may be regarded as lawful if it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, within the meaning of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, for the purpose of defending the legal and financial interests of the State which falls to the public prosecutor\u2019s office in those proceedings, provided that that processing of personal data complies with all the applicable requirements provided for by that regulation."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller

individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L\u00a0281, p.\u00a031), \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 means \u2018any operation or

Consequently, this Directive does not affect the ability of Member States to carry out lawful interception of electronic communications, or take other measures, if necessary for any of these purposes and in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as interpreted by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights. Such measures must be appropriate, strictly proportionate to the intended purpose and necessary within a democratic society and should be subject to adequate safeguards in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\u2026\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A communication may include any naming, numbering or addressing information provided by the sender of a communication or the user of a connection to carry out the communication.

The latter held that the measure requested would not serve to identify the perpetrators of the offence. Moreover, it refused to grant the request on the ground that Law 25/2007 limited the communication of the data retained by the providers of electronic communications services to serious offences. Under the Criminal Code, serious offences are punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than five years, whereas the facts at issue in the main proceedings did not appear to constitute such an offence.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office appealed against that order before the referring court, claiming that communication of the data at issue ought to have been allowed by reason of the nature of the facts and pursuant to a judgment of the Tribunal Supremo (Supreme Court, Spain) of 26\u00a0July 2010 relating to a similar case.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court explains that, subsequent to that order, the Spanish legislature amended the Code of Criminal Procedure by adopting Organic Law 13/2015. That legislation, which is relevant to the resolution of the case in the main proceedings, introduced two new alternative criteria for determining the degree of seriousness of an offence. The first is a substantive criterion, relating to conduct which corresponds to criminal classifications the criminal nature of which is specific and serious, and which is particularly harmful to individual and collective legal interests. Moreover, the national legislature relied on a formal normative criterion, based on the penalty prescribed for the offence in question. The threshold of three years\u2019 imprisonment envisaged by that criterion does, however, cover the great majority of offences. In addition, the referring court considers that the State\u2019s interest in punishing criminal conduct cannot justify disproportionate interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring court considers that, in the main proceedings, Directives 95/46 and 2002/58 establish a link with the Charter. The national legislation at issue in the main proceedings therefore comes within its scope, in accordance with Article\u00a051(1) of the Charter, despite the fact that Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\u00a0March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58 (OJ 2006 L\u00a0105, p.\u00a054) was annulled by the judgment of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n (C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238).\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that judgment, the Court recognised that the retention and communication of traffic data constitute particularly serious interferences with the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter and established criteria for the assessment of whether the principle of proportionality has been observed, including the seriousness of the offences warranting the retention of data and access thereto for the purposes of an investigation.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Audiencia Provincial de Tarragona (Provincial Court, Tarragona, Spain) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can the sufficient seriousness of offences, as a criterion which justifies interference with the fundamental rights recognised by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the [Charter], be determined taking into account only the sentence which may be imposed in respect of the offence investigated, or is it also necessary to identify in the criminal conduct particular levels of harm to individual and/or collective legally protected interests?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If it were in accordance with the constitutional principles of the European Union, used by the Court of Justice in its judgment [of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238] as standards for the strict review of [Directive 2002/58], to determine the seriousness of the offence solely on the basis of the sentence which may be imposed, what should the minimum threshold be? Would it be compatible with a general provision setting a minimum of three years\u2019 imprisonment?\u2019\n\u00a0\nProcedure before the Court\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of the President of the Court of 23\u00a0May 2016, the proceedings before the Court were stayed pending delivery of the judgment in \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15 (judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, EU:C:2016:970, hereinafter \u2018\nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n\u2019). Further to the delivery of that judgment, the referring court was asked whether it wished to maintain or withdraw its request for a preliminary ruling. In its response by letter of 30\u00a0January 2017, received at the Court on 14\u00a0February 2017, the referring court stated that, in its view, that judgment did not enable it to assess with a sufficient degree of certainty the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings in the light of EU law. Consequently, the proceedings before the Court were resumed on 16\u00a0February 2017.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Spanish Government claims that, first, the Court lacks jurisdiction to reply to the request for a preliminary ruling and, secondly, the request is inadmissible.\n\u00a0\nThe jurisdiction of the Court\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its written observations submitted to the Court, the Spanish Government expressed the view, endorsed by the United Kingdom Government during the hearing, that the Court does not have jurisdiction to answer the question referred for a preliminary ruling, on the ground that, in accordance with the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58, the case in the main proceedings is excluded from the scope of those two directives. Therefore, the case does not fall within the scope of EU law, with the result that the Charter, in accordance with Article\u00a051(1) thereof, is not applicable.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Spanish Government, the Court did, admittedly, rule in \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n that a legislative measure governing national authorities\u2019 access to data retained by providers of electronic communications services comes within the scope of Directive 2002/58. However, the present case concerns a request for access made by a public authority, by virtue of a judicial decision in connection with a criminal investigation, to personal data retained by providers of electronic communications services. The Spanish Government infers that the request for access is part of national authorities\u2019 exercise of \njus puniendi\n, as a result of which it constitutes an activity of the State in areas of criminal law falling under the exception provided for in the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to assess the claim that the Court does not have jurisdiction, it must be observed that Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2002/58 states that the directive provides for the harmonisation of the national provisions required, inter alia, to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy and confidentiality, with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector. In accordance with Article\u00a01(2) thereof, the directive particularises and complements Directive 95/46 for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58 excludes from its scope \u2018activities of the State\u2019 in specified fields, including the activities of the State in areas of criminal law and in the areas of public security, defence and State security, including the economic well-being of the State when the activities relate to State security matters (\nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, paragraph\u00a069 and the case-law cited). The activities mentioned therein by way of example are, in any event, activities of the State or of State authorities and are unrelated to fields in which individuals are active (see, by analogy, in respect of the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan Todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a038 and the case-law cited).\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03 of Directive 2002/58 states that the directive is to apply to the processing of personal data in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services in public communications networks in the European Union, including public communications networks supporting data collection and identification devices (\u2018electronic communications services\u2019). Consequently, that directive must be regarded as regulating the activities of the providers of such services (\nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, paragraph\u00a070).\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, the Court has previously held that the legislative measures that are referred to in that provision come within the scope of that directive, even if they concern activities characteristic of States or State authorities, and are unrelated to fields in which individuals are active, and even if the objectives that such measures must pursue overlap substantially with the objectives pursued by the activities referred to in Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58. Article\u00a015(1) necessarily presupposes that the national measures referred to therein fall within the scope of that directive, since it expressly authorises the Member States to adopt them only if the conditions laid down in the directive are met. Further, the legislative measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 govern, for the purposes mentioned in that provision, the activity of providers of electronic communications services (see, to that effect, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, paragraphs\u00a072 to 74).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court concluded that Article\u00a015(1), read in conjunction with Article\u00a03 of Directive 2002/58, must be interpreted as meaning that the scope of the directive extends not only to a legislative measure that requires providers of electronic communications services to retain traffic and location data, but also to a legislative measure relating to the access of the national authorities to the data retained by those providers (see, to that effect, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, paragraphs\u00a075 and 76).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The protection of the confidentiality of electronic communications and related traffic data, guaranteed by Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2002/58, applies to the measures taken by all persons other than users, whether private persons or bodies or State bodies. As confirmed in recital\u00a021 of that directive, the aim of the directive is to prevent unauthorised access to communications, including \u2018any data related to such communications\u2019, in order to protect the confidentiality of electronic communications (\nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, paragraph\u00a077).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that legislative measures requiring providers of electronic communications services to retain personal data or to grant competent national authorities access to those data necessarily involve the processing, by those providers, of the data (see, to that effect, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, paragraphs\u00a075 and 78). Such measures, to the extent that they regulate the activities of such providers, cannot be regarded as activities characteristic of States, referred to in Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, as stated in the order for reference, the request at issue in the main proceedings, by which the police seeks judicial authorisation to access personal data retained by providers of electronic communications services, is based on Law 25/2007, read in conjunction with the Code of Criminal Procedure in the version applicable to the facts in the main proceedings, which governs the access of public authorities to such data. That legislation permits the police, in the event that the judicial authorisation applied for on the basis of that legislation is granted, to require providers of electronic communications services to make personal data available to it and, in so doing, in the light of the definition in Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46, which is applicable in connection with Directive 2002/58 pursuant to the first paragraph of Article\u00a02 of the latter directive, to \u2018process\u2019 those data within the meaning of the two directives. That legislation therefore governs the activities of providers of electronic communications services and, as a result, falls within the scope of Directive 2002/58.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the fact, noted by the Spanish Government, that the request for access was made in connection with a criminal investigation does not make Directive 2002/58 inapplicable to the case in the main proceedings by virtue of Article\u00a01(3) of the directive.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also irrelevant in that regard that the request for access at issue in the main proceedings relates, as is apparent from the Spanish Government\u2019s written answer to a question raised by the Court and confirmed by both that government and the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office during the hearing, to the granting of access to only the telephone numbers corresponding to the SIM cards activated with the IMEI code of the stolen mobile telephone and to the data relating to the identity of the owners of those cards, such as their surnames, forenames and, if need be, addresses, not to the data relating to the communications carried out with those SIM cards and the location data concerning the stolen mobile telephone.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As observed by the Advocate General in point\u00a054 of his Opinion, Directive 2002/58, pursuant to Article\u00a01(1) and Article\u00a03 thereof, governs all processing of personal data in connection with the provision of electronic communications services. In addition, in accordance with subparagraph (b) of the second paragraph of Article\u00a02 of the directive, the notion of \u2018traffic data\u2019 covers \u2018any data processed for the purpose of the conveyance of a communication on an electronic communications network or for the billing thereof\u2019.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, as regards, more specifically, data relating to the identity of owners of SIM cards, it is apparent from recital\u00a015 of Directive 2002/58 that traffic data may include, inter alia, the name and address of the person sending a communication or using a connection to carry out a communication. Data relating to the identity of owners of SIM cards can also prove necessary in order to bill for the electronic communications services provided and therefore form part of traffic data as defined in subparagraph (b) of the second paragraph of Article\u00a02 of the directive. Consequently, those data fall within the scope of Directive 2002/58.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court therefore has jurisdiction to reply to the question raised by the referring court.\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Spanish Government argues that the request for a preliminary ruling is inadmissible on the ground that it does not clearly identify the provisions of EU law on which the Court is asked to give a preliminary ruling. What is more, the police request at issue in the main proceedings does not concern the interception of communications made by means of the SIM cards activated with the IMEI code of the stolen mobile telephone, but rather the establishment of a link between the cards and their owners, in such a way that the confidentiality of the communications is not affected. Article\u00a07 of the Charter, referred to in the questions referred for a preliminary ruling, is therefore irrelevant to the present case.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has consistently held that it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, where the questions put by national courts concern the interpretation of a provision of EU law, the Court is, in principle, bound to give a ruling. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court for a preliminary ruling only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan Todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a031 and the case-law cited).\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the order for reference contains sufficient factual and legal information required both for the definition of the provisions of EU law referred to in the questions referred for a preliminary ruling and for the understanding of the scope of those questions. More specifically, it is apparent from the order for reference that the questions referred for a preliminary ruling are intended to enable the referring court to assess whether, and to what extent, the national legislation, on which the police request at issue in the main proceedings is based, pursues an objective which is capable of justifying infringement of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter. According to the statements of the referring court, that national legislation falls within the scope of Directive 2002/58, with the result that the Charter is applicable to the case in the main proceedings. The questions referred for a preliminary ruling are thus directly related to the subject matter of the main proceedings and cannot therefore be regarded as hypothetical.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the questions referred for a preliminary ruling are admissible.\n\u00a0\nSubstance\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its two questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that public authorities\u2019 access to data for the purpose of identifying the owners of SIM cards activated with a stolen mobile telephone, such as the surnames, forenames and, if need be, addresses of the owners of the SIM cards, entails interference with their fundamental rights, enshrined in those articles of the Charter, which is sufficiently serious to entail that access being limited, in the area of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, to the objective of fighting serious crime and, if so, by reference to which criteria the seriousness of the offence at issue must be assessed.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is apparent from the order for reference that, as observed in essence by the Advocate General in point\u00a038 of his Opinion, the request for a preliminary ruling does not seek to determine whether the personal data at issue in the main proceedings have been retained by providers of electronic communications services in a manner consistent with the requirements laid down in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter. As stated in paragraph\u00a046 of this judgment, the request concerns only whether, and to what extent, the objective pursued by the legislation at issue in the main proceedings is capable of justifying the access of public authorities, such as the police, to such data, without the other conditions for access deriving from Article\u00a015(1) forming part of the subject matter of the request.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, the referring court is uncertain as to the factors that should be taken into consideration in order to assess whether the offences in respect of which the police may be authorised, for the purposes of an investigation, to have access to personal data retained by providers of electronic communications services are sufficiently serious to warrant the interference entailed by such access with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, as interpreted by the Court in its judgment of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n (C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238), and in \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the existence of an interference with those fundamental rights, it should be borne in mind, as observed by the Advocate General in points\u00a076 and 77 of his Opinion, that the access of public authorities to such data constitutes an interference with the fundamental right to respect for private life, enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, even in the absence of circumstances which would allow that interference to be defined as \u2018serious\u2019, without it being relevant that the information in question relating to private life is sensitive or whether the persons concerned have been inconvenienced in any way. Such access also constitutes interference with the fundamental right to the protection of personal data guaranteed in Article\u00a08 of the Charter, as it constitutes processing of personal data (see, to that effect, \nOpinion 1/15 (EU-Canada PNR Agreement)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, points\u00a0124 and 126 and the case-law cited).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objectives that are capable of justifying national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, governing the access of public authorities to data retained by providers of electronic communications services and thereby derogating from the principle of confidentiality of electronic communications, it must be borne in mind that the list of objectives set out in the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 is exhaustive, as a result of which that access must correspond, genuinely and strictly, to one of those objectives (see, to that effect, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, paragraphs\u00a090 and 115).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objective of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences, it should be noted that the wording of the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 does not limit that objective to the fight against serious crime alone, but refers to \u2018criminal offences\u2019 generally.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court has admittedly held that, in areas of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, only the objective of fighting serious crime is capable of justifying public authorities\u2019 access to personal data retained by providers of electronic communications services which, taken as a whole, allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data is concerned (see, to that effect, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, paragraph\u00a099).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the Court explained its interpretation by reference to the fact that the objective pursued by legislation governing that access must be proportionate to the seriousness of the interference with the fundamental rights in question that that access entails (see, to that effect, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n, paragraph\u00a0115).\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with the principle of proportionality, serious interference can be justified, in areas of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, only by the objective of fighting crime which must also be defined as \u2018serious\u2019.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, when the interference that such access entails is not serious, that access is capable of being justified by the objective of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting \u2018criminal offences\u2019 generally.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should therefore, first of all, be determined whether, in the present case, in the light of the facts of the case, the interference with fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter that police access to the data in question in the main proceedings would entail must be regarded as \u2018serious\u2019.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the sole purpose of the request at issue in the main proceedings, by which the police seeks, for the purposes of a criminal investigation, a court authorisation to access personal data retained by providers of electronic communications services, is to identify the owners of SIM cards activated over a period of 12 days with the IMEI code of the stolen mobile telephone. As noted in paragraph\u00a040 of the present judgment, that request seeks access to only the telephone numbers corresponding to those SIM cards and to the data relating to the identity of the owners of those cards, such as their surnames, forenames and, if need be, addresses. By contrast, those data do not concern, as confirmed by both the Spanish Government and the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office during the hearing, the communications carried out with the stolen mobile telephone or its location.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is therefore apparent that the data concerned by the request for access at issue in the main proceedings only enables the SIM card or cards activated with the stolen mobile telephone to be linked, during a specific period, with the identity of the owners of those SIM cards. Without those data being cross-referenced with the data pertaining to the communications with those SIM cards and the location data, those data do not make it possible to ascertain the date, time, duration and recipients of the communications made with the SIM card or cards in question, nor the locations where those communications took place or the frequency of those communications with specific people during a given period. Those data do not therefore allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data is concerned.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, access to only the data referred to in the request at issue in the main proceedings cannot be defined as \u2018serious\u2019 interference with the fundamental rights of the persons whose data is concerned.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As stated in paragraphs\u00a053 to 57 of this judgment, the interference that access to such data entails is therefore capable of being justified by the objective, to which the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 refers, of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting \u2018criminal offences\u2019 generally, without it being necessary that those offences be defined as \u2018serious\u2019.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the questions referred is that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that the access of public authorities to data for the purpose of identifying the owners of SIM cards activated with a stolen mobile telephone, such as the surnames, forenames and, if need be, addresses of the owners, entails interference with their fundamental rights, enshrined in those articles of the Charter, which is not sufficiently serious to entail that access being limited, in the area of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, to the objective of fighting serious crime.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as meaning that the access of public authorities to data for the purpose of identifying the owners of SIM cards activated with a stolen mobile telephone, such as the surnames, forenames and, if need be, addresses of the owners, entails interference with their fundamental rights, enshrined in those articles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is not sufficiently serious to entail that access being limited, in the area of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, to the objective of fighting serious crime."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v.

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 9 Mar 2017, C-398/15 (\nManni\n)\nGeneral data protection law \n >

following\nJudgment\n1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This request for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Article\u00a03 of the First Council Directive 68/151/EEC of 9\u00a0March 1968 on co-ordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article\u00a058 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community (OJ 1968 L\u00a065, p.\u00a08), as amended by Directive 2003/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\u00a0July 2003 (OJ 2003 L\u00a0221, p.\u00a013) (\u2018Directive 68/151\u2019), and Article\u00a06(1)(e) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L\u00a0281, p.\u00a031).\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The request has been made in proceedings between the Camera di Commercio, Industria, Artigianato e Agricoltura di Lecce (Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Crafts and Agriculture of Lecce, Italy, \u2018the Chamber of Commerce of Lecce\u2019) and Salvatore Manni concerning its refusal to delete certain personal data relating to Mr\u00a0Manni from the companies register.\n\u00a0\nLegal context\n\u00a0\nEU law\n\u00a0\nDirective 68/151\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As stated in recital\u00a03 of Directive 2003/58, the aim of the directive was, inter alia, to modernise Directive 68/151 so as to make \u2018company information more easily and rapidly accessible by interested parties, but should also simplify significantly the disclosure formalities imposed upon companies\u2019.\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The recitals of Directive 68/151 are worded as follows:\n\u2018Whereas the co-ordination provided for in Article\u00a054(3)(g) [of the EEC Treaty] and in the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment is a matter of urgency, especially in regard to companies limited by shares or otherwise having limited liability, since the activities of such companies often extend beyond the frontiers of national territories;\nWhereas the co-ordination of national provisions concerning disclosure, the validity of obligations entered into by, and the nullity of, such companies is of special importance, particularly for the purpose of protecting the interests of third parties;\nWhereas in these matters Community provisions must be adopted in respect of such companies simultaneously, since the only safeguards they offer to third parties are their assets;\nWhereas the basic documents of the company should be disclosed in order that third parties may be able to ascertain their contents and other information concerning the company, especially particulars of the persons who are authorised to bind the company;\nWhereas the protection of third parties must be ensured by provisions which restrict to the greatest possible extent the grounds on which obligations entered into in the name of the company are not valid;\nWhereas it is necessary, in order to ensure certainty in the law as regards relations between the company and third parties, and also between members, to limit the cases in which nullity can arise and the retroactive effect of a declaration of nullity, and to fix a short time limit within which third parties may enter objection to any such declaration\u2019.\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Article\u00a01 of Directive 68/151, the coordination measures prescribed by that directive apply to the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the forms of companies listed in that provision, including, for the Italian Republic, the \nsociet\u00e0 a responsabilit\u00e0 limitata\n (limited liability company).\n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a02 of that directive, which is set out in Section I thereof, entitled \u2018Disclosure\u2019, states:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall take the measures required to ensure compulsory disclosure by companies of at least the following documents and particulars:\n\u2026\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the appointment, termination of office and particulars of the persons who either as a body constituted pursuant to law or as members of any such body:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0are authorized to represent the company in dealings with third parties and in legal proceedings;\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0take part in the administration, supervision or control of the company.\n\u2026\n(h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the winding-up of the company;\n\u2026\n(j)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The appointment of liquidators, particulars concerning them, and their respective powers, unless such powers are expressly and exclusively derived from law or from the statutes of the company;\n(k)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the termination of the liquidation and, in Member States where striking off the register entails legal consequences, the fact of any such striking off.\u2019\n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03 of that directive, which is also set out in that section, provides:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In each Member State a file shall be opened in a central register, commercial register or companies register, for each of the companies registered therein.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All documents and particulars which must be disclosed in pursuance of Article\u00a02 shall be kept in the file or entered in the register; the subject matter of the entries in the register must in every case appear in the file.\n\u2026\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A copy of the whole or any part of the documents or particulars referred to in Article\u00a02 must be obtainable on application. As from 1\u00a0January 2007 at the latest, applications may be submitted to the register by paper means or by electronic means as the applicant chooses.\nAs from a date to be chosen by each Member State, which shall be no later than 1\u00a0January 2007, copies as referred to in the first subparagraph must be obtainable from the register by paper means or by electronic means as the applicant chooses.

In the absence of any provision in the Civil Code laying down a maximum period of registration, that court held that, \u2018after an appropriate period\u2019 from the conclusion of the liquidation, and after the company has been removed from the register, stating the name of the person who was sole director of that company at the time of the liquidation ceased to be necessary and useful, for the purposes of Legislative Decree No\u00a0196, and the public interest in a \u2018historical memory\u2019 of the existence of the company and the difficulties it experienced [could] to a great extent be just as well effected by means of anonymous data\u2019.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Lecce Chamber of Commerce brought an appeal against that judgment before the Corte suprema di cassazione (Court of Cassation, Italy), which decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the principle of keeping personal data in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed, laid down in Article\u00a06(1)(e) of Directive 95/46, transposed by Legislative Decree No\u00a0196 of 30\u00a0June 2003, take precedence over and, therefore, preclude the system of disclosure established by means of the companies register provided for by Directive 68/151 and by national law in Article\u00a02188 of the Civil Code and Article\u00a08 of Law No\u00a0580 of 29\u00a0December 1993, in so far as it is a requirement of that system that anyone may, at any time, obtain the data relating to individuals in those registers?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, is it permissible under Article\u00a03 of Directive 68/151, by way of derogation from the principles that there should be no time limit and that anyone may consult the data published in the companies register, for the data no longer to be subject to \u201cdisclosure\u201d, in both those regards, but to be available for only a limited period and only to certain recipients, on the basis of a case-by-case assessment by the data manager?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its questions, which should be considered together, the referring court asks, essentially, whether Article\u00a03 of Directive 68/151 and Article\u00a06(1)(e) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that Member States may, and indeed must, allow individuals, covered by Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) of Directive 68/151, to request the authority responsible for maintaining the companies register to limit, after a certain period has elapsed from the dissolution of the company concerned and on the basis of a case-by-case assessment, access to personal data concerning them and entered in that register.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted at the outset that the case at issue in the main proceedings and the questions referred to the Court for a preliminary ruling do not concern the subsequent processing of the data at issue in this case by a specialised rating company, referred to in paragraph\u00a025 of the present judgment, but rather the accessibility of such data held in the companies register by third parties.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must first be pointed out that, under Article\u00a02(1)(d) of Directive 68/151, Member States must take the measures necessary to ensure compulsory disclosure by companies of at least the appointment, termination of office and particulars of the persons who either as a body constituted pursuant to law, or as members of any such body, are authorised to represent the company in dealings with third parties and in legal proceedings, or take part in the administration, supervision or control of that company. Moreover, according to Article\u00a02(1)(j), the appointment of liquidators, particulars concerning them and, in principle, their respective powers must also be disclosed.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Article\u00a03(1) to (3) of Directive 68/151, those particulars must be transcribed in each Member State either in a central register, commercial register or companies register (together, \u2018the register\u2019), and a copy of the whole or any part of those particulars must be obtainable by application.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be held that the particulars concerning the identity of the persons referred to in Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) of Directive 68/151 constitute, as information relating to identified or identifiable natural persons, \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46. It is apparent from the Court\u2019s case-law that the fact that that information was provided as part of a professional activity does not mean that it cannot be characterised as personal data (see judgment of 16\u00a0July 2015, \nClientEarth and PAN Europe\n v \nEFSA\n, C-615/13\u00a0P, EU:C:2015:489, paragraph\u00a030 and the case-law cited).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, by transcribing and keeping that information in the register and communicating it, where appropriate, on request to third parties, the authority responsible for maintaining that register carries out \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 for which it is the \u2018controller\u2019, within the meaning of the definitions set out Article\u00a02(b) and (d) of Directive 95/46.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data which is thus carried out in the implementation of Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) and Article\u00a03 of Directive 68/151 is subject to Directive 95/46, under Articles\u00a01 and 3 thereof. This is now expressly provided for in Article\u00a07a of Directive 2009/101, as amended by Directive 2012/17, which, however, is only declaratory in that regard. As the European Commission stated at the hearing, the EU legislature considered it useful to recall that fact in the context of the legislative changes introduced by Directive 2012/17 and aimed at ensuring interoperability of registers of the Member States, since those changes suggested an increase in the intensity of the processing of personal data.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to Directive 95/46, it should be remembered that, as is apparent from Article\u00a01 and recital\u00a010, that directive seeks to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data (see judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a066 and the case-law cited).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to recital\u00a025 of Directive 95/46, the principles of protection laid down by the directive are reflected, on the one hand, in the obligations imposed on persons responsible for processing data, in particular regarding data quality, technical security, notification to the supervisory authority and the circumstances under which processing can be carried out, and, on the other hand, in the rights conferred on individuals whose data are the subject of processing to be informed that such processing is taking place, to consult the data, to request corrections and even to object to processing in certain circumstances.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already held that the provisions of Directive 95/46, in so far as they govern the processing of personal data liable to infringe fundamental freedoms and, in particular, the right to respect for private life, must necessarily be interpreted in the light of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019) (see judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a038 and the case-law cited).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a07 of the Charter therefore guarantees the right to respect for private life, whilst Article\u00a08 of the Charter expressly proclaims the right to the protection of personal data. Article\u00a08(2) and (3) states that such data must be processed fairly, for specific purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law, that everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her and the right to have it rectified, and that compliance with those rules is to be subject to control by an independent authority. Those requirements are implemented inter alia in Articles\u00a06, 7, 12, 14 and 28 of Directive 95/46.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard, in particular, to the general conditions of lawfulness imposed by Directive 95/46, it should be noted that, subject to the exceptions permitted under Article\u00a013 of that directive, all processing of personal data must comply, first, with the principles relating to data quality set out in Article\u00a06 of the directive and, secondly, with one of the criteria for making data processing legitimate listed in Article\u00a07 of the directive (see, inter alia, judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a071 and the case-law cited).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as the Advocate General pointed out in point\u00a052 of his Opinion, it should be noted that the processing of personal data by the authority responsible for keeping the register pursuant to Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) and Article\u00a03 of Directive 68/151 satisfies several grounds for legitimation provided for in Article\u00a07 of Directive 95/46, namely those set out in subparagraph (c) thereof, relating to compliance with a legal obligation, subparagraph (e), relating to the exercise of official authority or the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, and subparagraph (f) relating to the realisation of a legitimate interest pursued by the controller or by the third parties to whom the data are disclosed.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard, inter alia, to the ground for legitimation provided for in Article\u00a07(e) of Directive 95/46, it should be noted that the Court of Justice has already held that the activity of a public authority consisting in the storing, in a database, of data which undertakings are obliged to report on the basis of statutory obligations, permitting interested persons to search for that data and providing them with print-outs thereof, falls within the exercise of public powers (see judgment of 12\u00a0July 2012, \nCompass-Datenbank\n, C-138/11, EU:C:2012:449, paragraphs\u00a040 and 41). Moreover, such an activity also constitutes a task carried out in the public interest within the meaning of that provision.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the parties to the main proceedings disagree as to whether the authority responsible for keeping the register should, after a certain period has elapsed since a company ceased to trade, and on the request of the data subject, either erase or anonymise that personal data, or limit their disclosure. In that context, the referring court asks in particular whether such an obligation flows from Article\u00a06(1)(e) of Directive 95/46.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Article\u00a06(1)(e) of Directive 95/46, Member States are to ensure that personal data are kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed. Where that data are stored for longer periods for historical, statistical or scientific use, Member States must lay down appropriate safeguards. Pursuant to paragraph\u00a02 of that article, it is the responsibility of the controller to ensure compliance with those principles.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event of failure to comply with the condition laid down in Article\u00a06(1)(e) of Directive 95/46, Member States guarantee the person concerned, pursuant to Article\u00a012(b) thereof, the right to obtain from the controller, as appropriate, the erasure or blocking of the data concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a070).\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, under subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46, Member States are to grant the data subject the right, inter alia in the cases referred to in Article\u00a07(e) and (f) of that directive, to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation to the processing of data relating to him, save where otherwise provided by national legislation. The balancing to be carried out under subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 thus enables account to be taken in a more specific manner of all the circumstances surrounding the data subject\u2019s particular situation. Where there is a justified objection, the processing instigated by the controller may no longer involve those data (see judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a076).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to determine whether Member States are required, under Article\u00a06(1)(e) and Article\u00a012(b), or under subsection (a) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46, to provide, for the natural persons referred to in Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) of Directive 68/151, the right to apply to the authority responsible for keeping the register to erase or block the personal data entered in that register after a certain period of time, or to restrict access to it, it is first necessary to ascertain the purpose of that registration.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is apparent from the recitals and from the title of Directive 68/151 that the purpose of the disclosure provided for by that directive is to protect in particular the interests of third parties in relation to joint stock companies and limited liability companies, since the only safeguards they offer to third parties are their assets. To that end, the basic documents of the company concerned should be disclosed in order that third parties may be able to ascertain their contents and other information concerning the company, especially particulars of the persons who are authorised to bind the company.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already noted, moreover, that the purpose of Directive 68/151 is to guarantee legal certainty in relation to dealings between companies and third parties in view of the intensification of trade between Member States following the creation of the internal market and that, with that in mind, it is important that any person wishing to establish and develop trading relations with companies situated in other Member States should be able easily to obtain essential information relating to the constitution of trading companies and to the powers of persons authorised to represent them, which requires that all the relevant information should be expressly stated in the register (see, to that effect, judgment of 12\u00a0November 1974, \nHaaga\n, 32/74, EU:C:1974:116, paragraph\u00a06).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it is apparent from the case-law of the Court that the disclosure provided for in Article\u00a03 of Directive 68/151 is intended to enable any interested third parties to inform themselves of these matters, without having to establish a right or an interest requiring to be protected. The Court noted, in that regard, that the very wording of Article\u00a054(3)(g) of the EEC Treaty, on which that directive was based, refers to the need to protect the interests of third parties generally, without distinguishing or excluding any categories falling within the ambit of that term, and consequently the third parties referred to in that article cannot be limited in particular merely to creditors of the company concerned (see judgment of 4\u00a0December 1997, \nDaihatsu Deutschland\n, C-97/96, EU:C:1997:581, paragraphs\u00a019, 20 and 22, and the order of 23\u00a0September 2004, \nSpringer\n, C-435/02 and C-103/03, EU:C:2004:552, paragraphs\u00a029 and 33).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as to whether, in order to achieve the aim referred to in Article\u00a03 of Directive 68/151, it is in principle necessary for the personal data of natural persons referred to in Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) of that directive to remain on the register and/or accessible to any third party upon request also after the activity has ceased and the company concerned has been dissolved, it should be pointed out that the directive makes no express provision in that regard.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as the Advocate General also pointed out in points\u00a073 and 74 of his Opinion, it is common ground that even after the dissolution of a company, rights and legal relations relating to it continue to exist. Thus, in the event of a dispute, the data referred to in Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) of Directive 68/151 may be necessary in order, inter alia, to assess the legality of an act carried out on behalf of that company during the period of its activity or so that third parties can bring an action against the members of the organs or against the liquidators of that company.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, depending in particular on the limitation periods applicable in the various Member States, questions requiring such data may arise for many years after a company has ceased to exist.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the range of possible scenarios, which may involve actors in several Member States, and the considerable heterogeneity in the limitation periods provided for by the various national laws in the various areas of law, highlighted by the Commission, it seems impossible, at present, to identify a single time limit, as from the dissolution of a company, at the end of which the inclusion of such data in the register and their disclosure would no longer be necessary.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, Member States cannot, pursuant to Article\u00a06(1)(e) and Article\u00a012(b) of Directive 95/46, guarantee that the natural persons referred to in Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) of Directive 68/151 have the right to obtain, as a matter of principle, after a certain period of time from the dissolution of the company concerned, the erasure of personal data concerning them, which have been entered in the register pursuant to the latter provision, or the blocking of that data from the public.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation of Article\u00a06(1)(e) and Article\u00a012(b) of Directive 95/46 does not, moreover, result in disproportionate interference with the fundamental rights of the persons concerned, and particularly their right to respect for private life and their right to protection of personal data as guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) and Article\u00a03 of Directive 68/151 require disclosure only for a limited number of personal data items, namely those relating to the identity and the respective functions of persons having the power to bind the company concerned to third parties and to represent it or take part in the administration, supervision or control of that company, or having been appointed as liquidator of that company.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, as pointed out in paragraph\u00a049 of the present judgment, Directive 68/151 provides for disclosure of the data referred to in Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) thereof, due, in particular, to the fact that the only safeguards that joint-stock companies and limited liability companies offer to third parties are their assets, which constitutes an increased economic risk for the latter. In view of this, it appears justified that natural persons who choose to participate in trade through such a company are required to disclose the data relating to their identity and functions within that company, especially since they are aware of that requirement when they decide to engage in such activity.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, as regards subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46, it must be pointed out that, whereas it follows from the foregoing that, in the weighting to be carried out under that provision, in principle, the need to protect the interests of third parties in relation to joint-stock companies and limited liability companies and to ensure legal certainty, fair trading and thus the proper functioning of the internal market take precedence, it cannot be excluded, however, that there may be specific situations in which the overriding and legitimate reasons relating to the specific case of the person concerned justify exceptionally that access to personal data entered in the register is limited, upon expiry of a sufficiently long period after the dissolution of the company in question, to third parties who can demonstrate a specific interest in their consultation.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, however, it should be pointed out that, in so far as the application of subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 is subject to the proviso that national law does not lay down a provision to the contrary, the final decision as to whether the natural persons referred to in Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) of Directive 68/151 may apply to the authority responsible for keeping the register for such limitation of access to personal data concerning them, on the basis of a case-by-case assessment, is a matter for the national legislatures.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for the referring court to determine the provisions of its national law in that regard.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assuming that such an examination reveals that national law permits such applications, it will be for the national court to assess, having regard to all the relevant circumstances and taking into account the time elapsed since the dissolution of the company concerned, the possible existence of legitimate and overriding reasons which, as the case may be, exceptionally justify limiting third parties\u2019 access to the data concerning Mr\u00a0Manni in the company register, from which it is apparent that he was the sole administrator and liquidator of Immobiliare Salentina. In that regard, it should be pointed out that the mere fact that, allegedly, the properties of a tourist complex built by Italiana Costruzioni, of which Mr\u00a0Manni is currently the sole director, do not sell because of the fact that potential purchasers of those properties have access to that data in the company register, cannot be regarded as constituting such a reason, in particular in view of the legitimate interest of those purchasers in having that information.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the questions referred must be that Article\u00a06(1)(e), Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46, read in conjunction with Article\u00a03 of Directive 68/151, must be interpreted as meaning that, as EU law currently stands, it is for the Member States to determine whether the natural persons referred to in Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) of that directive may apply to the authority responsible for keeping the register to determine, on the basis of a case-by-case assessment, if it is exceptionally justified, on compelling legitimate grounds relating to their particular situation, to limit, on the expiry of a sufficiently long period after the dissolution of the company concerned, access to personal data relating to them, entered in that register, to third parties who can demonstrate a specific interest in consulting that data.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a06(1)(e), Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, read in conjunction with Article\u00a03 of the First Council Directive 68/151/EEC of 9\u00a0March 1968 on co-ordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article\u00a058 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community, as amended by Directive 2003/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\u00a0July 2003, must be interpreted as meaning that, as EU law currently stands, it is for the Member States to determine whether the natural persons referred to in Article\u00a02(1)(d) and (j) of that directive may apply to the authority responsible for keeping, respectively, the central register, commercial register or companies register to determine, on the basis of a case-by-case assessment, if it is exceptionally justified, on compelling legitimate grounds relating to their particular situation, to limit, on the expiry of a sufficiently long period after the dissolution of the company concerned, access to personal data relating to them, entered in that register, to third parties who can demonstrate a specific interest in consulting that data."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 25 Jan 2024, C-687/21 (\nSaturn Electro\n)\n \nJUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Third

request for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Article\u00a02(1), Article\u00a04, point\u00a07, Article\u00a05(1)(f), Article\u00a06(1), Article\u00a024, Article\u00a032(1)(b) and

the validity of Article\u00a082.\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The request has been made in proceedings between BL, a natural person, and MediaMarktSaturn Hagen-Iserlohn GmbH, formerly known as Saturn Electro-Handelsgesellschaft mbH Hagen (\u2018Saturn\u2019), concerning compensation for the non-material damage which that person claims to have suffered on account of the transmission by a third party of some of his personal data due to an error made by employees of that company.\n\u00a0\nLegal context\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a011, 74, 76, 83, 85 and 146 of the GDPR are worded as follows:\n\u2018(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective protection of personal data throughout the [European] Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data,\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The responsibility and liability of the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on the controller\u2019s behalf should be established. In particular, the controller should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.\n\u2026\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject should be determined by reference to the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing. Risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment, by which it is established whether data processing operations involve a risk or a high risk.\n\u2026\n(83)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation, the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption. Those measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. In assessing data security risk, consideration should be given to the risks that are presented by personal data processing, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed which may in particular lead to physical, material or non-material damage.\n\u2026\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A personal data breach may, if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical, material or non-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their personal data or limitation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural person concerned.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(146)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer as a result of processing that infringes this Regulation. The controller or processor should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the damage. The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation.

A sales contract and a credit agreement were drawn up, to that effect, by an employee of that company. At that same time, that employee entered in Saturn\u2019s information system a number of items of personal data of that customer, namely his surname and first name, address, place of residence, name of his employer, income and bank details.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The contractual documents containing that personal data were printed and signed by both parties. The applicant in the main proceedings then brought the documents to Saturn employees working at the collection counter. Another customer, who surreptitiously jumped the queue, accordingly received, by error, both the appliance ordered by the applicant in the main proceedings as well as the documents concerned and left with everything.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the error was quickly discovered, an employee of Saturn obtained the return of the appliance and the documents, then gave them to the applicant in the main proceedings, within half an hour after they had been given to the other customer. The undertaking wished to compensate the applicant in the main proceedings for that error by delivering the appliance concerned to the applicant\u2019s home free of charge, but the applicant was of the view that that compensation was inadequate.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicant in the main proceedings brought an action before the Amtsgericht Hagen (Local Court, Hagen, Germany), which is the referring court in the present case, seeking, in particular on the basis of the provisions of the GDPR, compensation for non-material damage that he claims to have suffered on account of the error made by the Saturn employees and the risk of a resulting loss of control over his personal data.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its defence, Saturn contends that there was not any infringement of the GDPR and that an infringement could only exist if it exceeded a certain threshold of severity, not reached in the present case. Furthermore, that company submits that the applicant in the main proceedings did not suffer any damage, since it was neither established nor put forward that the third party involved misused the personal data of the concerned party.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court questions, first, the validity of Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, on account of that article appearing to it to lack detail as to its legal effects in the event of compensation for non-material damage.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, if Article\u00a082 is not declared invalid by the Court, the referring court asks whether exercising the right to compensation provided for in that article presupposes establishing the existence not only of an infringement of the GDPR but also damage, particularly non-material damage, suffered by the person seeking compensation.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, the referring court seeks to determine whether the mere fact that the printed documents containing personal data were transmitted without permission to a third party, on account of a mistake made by the employees of the controller, enables or does not enable a finding of infringement of the GDPR.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourthly, while holding that \u2018the [defendant] undertaking must bear the burden of proving its innocence\u2019, that referring court seeks to know whether it suffices that such a negligent handover of documents took place, in order to hold that it amounts to an infringement of the GDPR, particularly regarding the obligation incumbent on the controller to implement appropriate measures to ensure the security of the processed data, under Articles\u00a02, 5, 6 and 24 of that regulation.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fifthly, the referring court asks whether, even if it seems that the unauthorised third party was not aware of the personal data concerned before returning the documents containing those data, the existence of \u2018non-material damage\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, may be established from the mere fact that the person whose data were thus transmitted is fearful of the risk, which cannot be excluded according to that court, that those data are communicated to other individuals by that third party, and misused in the future.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sixthly, that referring court is seeking clarification as to the potential effect, in an action for non-material damage under Article\u00a082, of the degree of severity of an infringement made in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, given that more effective security measures could have been adopted, in its opinion, by the controller.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, seventhly, the referring court seeks to ascertain the purpose of the compensation for non-material damage payable under the GDPR, by suggesting that that compensation could have the nature of a penalty equivalent to that of a contractual penalty.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Amtsgericht Hagen (Local Court, Hagen) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As no automatic legal effects are specified, is the compensation rule enacted in Article\u00a082 of the [GDPR] invalid in the case of non-material damage?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it necessary, for the purposes of the right to compensation, to establish the occurrence of non-material damage, to be demonstrated by the claimant, in addition to the unauthorised disclosure of the protected data to an unauthorised third party?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the accidental disclosure of the personal data of the data subject (name, address, occupation, income, employer) to a third party in a paper document (printout), as the result of a mistake by employees of the [concerned] undertaking, suffice in order to establish infringement of the [GDPR]?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the undertaking accidentally discloses, through its employees, data entered in an automated data processing system to an unauthorised third party in the form of a printout, does that accidental disclosure to a third party qualify as unlawful further processing (Article\u00a02(1), Article\u00a05(1)(f), Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a024 of the [GDPR])?\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is non-material damage within the meaning of Article\u00a082 of the [GDPR] incurred even where the third party who received the document containing the personal data did not read the data before returning the document containing the information, or does the discomfort of the person whose personal data were unlawfully disclosed suffice for the purpose of establishing non-material damage within the meaning of Article\u00a082 of the [GDPR], given that every unauthorised disclosure of personal data entails the risk, which cannot be eliminated, that the data might nevertheless have been passed on to any number of people or even misused?\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where accidental disclosure to third parties is preventable through better supervision of the undertaking\u2019s helpers and/or better data security arrangements, for example by handling collections separately from contract documentation (especially financing documentation) under separate collection notes or by sending the documentation internally to the collection counter without giving the customer the printed documents and collection note, how serious should the infringement be considered to be (Article\u00a032(1)(b) and (2) and Article\u00a04, point\u00a07, of the [GDPR])?\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is compensation for non-material damage to be regarded as the award of a penalty similar to a contract penalty?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks whether Article\u00a082 of the GDPR is invalid in so far as it lacks detail as to the legal inferences which can be drawn by way of compensation for non-material damage.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The European Parliament submits that that question is inadmissible, since the referring court did not meet the requirements of Article\u00a094(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, even if the referring court raises a particularly complex issue, namely the assessment of the validity of a provision of EU law.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a094(c) of the Rules of Procedure, the request for a preliminary ruling must, in particular, contain, in addition to the text of the questions referred to the Court for a preliminary ruling, a statement of the reasons which prompted the referring court or tribunal to inquire about the interpretation or validity of certain provisions of EU law.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the statement of the reasons for the reference for a preliminary ruling is necessary not only to enable the Court to give useful answers but also for the governments of the Member States and other interested parties to submit observations, in accordance with Article\u00a023 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union. More specifically, it is in light of the grounds of invalidity set out in the referring decision that the Court must examine the validity of a provision of EU law, so that if there is no mention of the precise reasons which led the referring court to question the validity of that act or of those provisions, the questions relating to the invalidity thereof will be inadmissible (see, to that effect, judgments of 15\u00a0June 2017, \nT.KUP\n, C-349/16, EU:C:2017:469, paragraphs\u00a016 to 18, and of 22\u00a0June 2023, \nVitol\n, C-268/22, EU:C:2023:508, paragraphs\u00a052 to 55).\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, however, the referring court does not put forward any specific information enabling the Court to examine the validity of Article\u00a082 of the GDPR.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the first question must be declared inadmissible.\n\u00a0\nThe third and fourth questions\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third and fourth questions, which should be examined together and at the outset, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Articles\u00a05, 24, 32 and 82 of the GDPR, read together, must be interpreted as meaning that, in an action for compensation under Article\u00a082, the fact that the employees of the controller provided to an unauthorised third party in error a document containing personal data is sufficient, in itself, to consider that the technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller at issue were not \u2018appropriate\u2019, within the meaning of Articles\u00a024 and 32.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a024 of the GDPR lays down a general obligation, on the part of the controller of personal data, to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that that processing is performed in accordance with that regulation and to be able to demonstrate this (judgment of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraph\u00a024).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a032 of the GDPR sets out, for its part, the obligations of the controller and a possible processor as regards the security of that processing. Thus, paragraph\u00a01 of that article provides that the controller and the processor must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks in relation to that processing, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing concerned. Similarly, paragraph\u00a02 of that article states that, in assessing the appropriate level of security, account is to be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data (see, to that effect, judgment of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraphs\u00a026 and 27).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent, accordingly, from the wording of Articles\u00a024 and 32 of the GDPR that the appropriateness of the measures implemented by the controller must be assessed in a concrete manner, taking into account the various criteria referred to in those articles and the data protection needs specifically inherent in the processing concerned and the risks arising from the latter, and that all the more since that controller must be able to demonstrate that the measures it implemented comply with that regulation, a possibility which it would be deprived of if an irrebuttable presumption were accepted (see, to that effect, judgment of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraphs\u00a030 to 32).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That literal interpretation is supported by reading Articles\u00a024 and 32 together with Article\u00a05(2) and Article\u00a082 of that regulation, read in the light of recitals\u00a074, 76 and 83 thereof, from which it follows, in particular, that the controller is obliged to mitigate the risks of personal data breaches and not prevent all breaches of those data (see, to that effect, judgment of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraphs\u00a033 to 38).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Court interpreted Articles\u00a024 and 32 of the GDPR as meaning that unauthorised disclosure of personal data or unauthorised access to those data by a \u2018third party\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04, point\u00a010, of that regulation, are not sufficient, in themselves, for it to be held that the technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller in question were not \u2018appropriate\u2019, within the meaning of Articles\u00a024 and 32 (judgment of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraph\u00a039).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the fact that the employees of the controller provided to an unauthorised third party in error a document containing personal data is capable of indicating that the technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller at issue were not \u2018appropriate\u2019, within the meaning of those Articles\u00a024 and 32. In particular, such a circumstance may result from negligence or a failure in the controller\u2019s organisation, which does not take into account in a concrete manner the risks in relation to the processing of the data at issue.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be pointed out that it follows from a reading of Articles\u00a05, 24 and 32 of the GDPR together, read in the light of recital\u00a074 thereof, that, in an action for compensation under Article\u00a082 of that regulation, the controller concerned bears the burden of proving that the personal data are processed in such a way as to ensure appropriate security of those data, within the meaning of Article\u00a05(1)(f) and of Article\u00a032 of that regulation. Such an allocation of the burden of proof is capable not only of encouraging the controllers of those data of adopting the security measures required by the GDPR, but also in retaining the effectiveness of the right to compensation provided for in Article\u00a082 of that regulation and upholding the intentions of the EU legislature referred to in recital\u00a011 thereof (see, to that effect, judgment of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraphs\u00a049 to 56).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Court interpreted the principle of accountability of the controller, set out in Article\u00a05(2) of the GDPR and given expression in Article\u00a024 thereof, as meaning that, in an action for compensation under Article\u00a082 of that regulation, the controller in question bears the burden of proving that the security measures implemented by it are appropriate pursuant to Article\u00a032 of that regulation (judgment of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraph\u00a057).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, a court hearing such an action for compensation under Article\u00a082 of the GDPR cannot take into account only the fact that the employees of the controller provided to an unauthorised third party in error a document containing personal data, in order to determine whether there is an infringement of an obligation laid down in that regulation. That court must also take into account all of the evidence that the controller provided to demonstrate that the technical and organisational measures adopted by him or her are appropriate with a view to complying with his or her obligations under Articles\u00a024 and 32 of that regulation.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the foregoing reasons, the answer to the third and fourth questions is that Articles\u00a05, 24, 32 and 82 of the GDPR, read together, must be interpreted as meaning that, in an action for compensation based on Article\u00a082, the fact that the employees of the controller provided to an unauthorised third party in error a document containing personal data is not sufficient, in itself, to consider that the technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller at issue were not \u2018appropriate\u2019, within the meaning of Articles\u00a024 and 32.\n\u00a0\nThe seventh question\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its seventh question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a082 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the right to compensation provided for in that provision, in particular in the case of non-material damage, fulfils a punitive function.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court held that Article\u00a082 of the GDPR fulfils a function that is compensatory and not punitive, contrary to other provisions of that regulation also contained in Chapter VIII thereof, namely Articles\u00a083 and 84, which have, for their part, essentially a punitive purpose, since they permit the imposition of administrative fines and other penalties, respectively. The relationship between the rules set out in Article\u00a082 and those set out in Articles\u00a083 and 84 shows that there is a difference between those two categories of provisions, but also complementarity, in terms of encouraging compliance with the GDPR, it being observed that the right of any person to seek compensation for damage reinforces the operational nature of the protection rules laid down by that regulation and is likely to discourage the reoccurrence of unlawful conduct (see, to that effect, judgments of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Non-material damage in connection with the processing of personal data)\n, C-300/21, EU:C:2023:370, paragraphs\u00a038 and 40, and of 21\u00a0December 2023, \nKrankenversicherung Nordrhein\n, C-667/21, EU:C:2023:1022, paragraph\u00a085).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court stated that, since the right to damages provided for in Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR does not fulfil a deterrent function, or even punitive, but fulfils a compensatory function, the severity of the infringement of that regulation that caused the damage concerned cannot influence the amount of the compensation granted under that provision, even where it concerns non-material damage and not material damage, in that that amount cannot exceed the full compensation for that damage (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2023, \nKrankenversicherung Nordrhein\n, C-667/21, EU:C:2023:1022, paragraphs\u00a086 and 87).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that it is not necessary to rule on the alignment, contemplated by the referring court, between the purpose referred to by the right to compensation laid down in Article\u00a082(1) and the punitive function of a contractual penalty.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the answer to the seventh question is that Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the right to compensation laid down in that provision, in particular in the case of non-material damage, fulfils a compensatory function, in that financial compensation based on that provision must allow the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation to be compensated in full, and not a punitive function.\n\u00a0\nThe sixth question\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its sixth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a082 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that that article requires that the degree of severity of the infringement of that regulation made by the controller is taken into consideration for the purposes of compensation under that provision.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it follows from Article\u00a082 of the GDPR that, first, establishing the liability of the controller is, in particular, subject to fault on the part of the controller, which is presupposed unless it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage, and secondly, Article\u00a082 does not require that the severity of that fault is taken into consideration when setting the amount of the compensation allocated for non-material damage under that provision (judgment of 21\u00a0December 2023, \nKrankenversicherung Nordrhein\n, C-667/21, EU:C:2023:1022, paragraph\u00a0103).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the assessment of the compensation payable under Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, since that regulation does not contain a measure having such an aim, the national courts must, for the purpose of that assessment, apply the internal rules of each Member State relating to the extent of the pecuniary compensation, to the extent that the principles of equivalence and effectiveness of EU law can be observed (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2023, \nKrankenversicherung Nordrhein\n, C-667/21, EU:C:2023:1022, paragraphs\u00a083 and 101 and the case-law cited).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Court stated that, having regard to the compensatory function of the right to compensation laid down in Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, that provision does not require taking into consideration the severity of the infringement of that regulation, that the controller is presumed to have made, while setting the amount of the compensation allocated for non-material damage under that provision, but requires that that amount is set in a way that the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation is compensated in full (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2023, \nKrankenversicherung Nordrhein\n, C-667/21, EU:C:2023:1022, paragraphs\u00a084 to 87 and 102 and the case-law cited).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the foregoing reasons, the answer to the sixth question that Article 82 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that that article does not require that the severity of the infringement made by the controller be taken into consideration for the purposes of compensation under that provision.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the person seeking compensation under that provision is required to establish not only the infringement of provisions of that regulation, but also that that infringement led to his or her non-material or material damage.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR provides that \u2018any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered\u2019.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the wording of that provision that the mere infringement of the GDPR is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation. The existence of \u2018damage\u2019 or \u2018harm\u2019 which has been \u2018suffered\u2019 constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation laid down in Article\u00a082(1), as does the existence of an infringement of that regulation and of a causal link between that damage and that infringement, those three conditions being cumulative (see, to that effect, judgments of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Non-material damage in connection with the processing of personal data)\n, C-300/21, EU:C:2023:370, paragraphs\u00a032 and 42; of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraph\u00a077; of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nGemeinde Ummendorf\n, C-456/22, EU:C:2023:988, paragraph\u00a014; and of 21\u00a0December 2023, \nKrankenversicherung Nordrhein\n, C-667/21, EU:C:2023:1022, paragraph\u00a082).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in particular, the non-material damage, the Court also held that Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR precludes a national rule or practice which makes compensation for non-material damage, within the meaning of that provision, subject to the condition that the damage suffered by the data subject, as defined in Article\u00a04, point\u00a01, of that regulation, has reached a certain degree of seriousness (see, to that effect, judgments of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Non-material damage in connection with the processing of personal data)\n, C-300/21, EU:C:2023:370, paragraph\u00a051; of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraph\u00a078; and of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nGemeinde Ummendorf\n, C-456/78, EU:C:2023:988, paragraph\u00a016).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court stated that a person concerned by an infringement of the GDPR which had negative consequences for him or her is, however, required to demonstrate that those consequences constitute non-material damage, within the meaning of Article\u00a082 of that regulation, since the mere infringement of the provisions thereof are not sufficient to confer a right to compensation (see, to that effect, judgments of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Non-material damage in connection with the processing of personal data)\n, C-300/21, EU:C:2023:370, paragraphs\u00a042 and 50; of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraph\u00a084; and of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nGemeinde Ummendorf\n, C-456/78, EU:C:2023:988, paragraphs\u00a021 and 23).\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the foregoing reasons, the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the person seeking compensation by way of that provision is required to establish not only the infringement of provisions of that regulation, but also that that infringement caused him or her material or non-material damage.\n\u00a0\nThe fifth question\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fifth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, if a document containing personal data was provided to an unauthorised person, and it was established that that person did not become aware of those personal data, \u2018non-material damage\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, is likely to consist of the mere fact that the person concerned fears that, following that communication which made it possible to make a copy of that document before returning it, a dissemination, even abuse, of those data may occur in the future.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is important to specify that the referring court states that, in the present case, the document containing the data concerned was returned to the applicant in the main proceedings within half an hour following it having been provided to an unauthorised third party and that that unauthorised third party did not become aware of those data before the document\u2019s return. That applicant submits, however, that that document\u2019s provision gave that third party the possibility to take copies of the document before returning it and that it therefore created a fear for the applicant linked to the risk occurring in the future of those data being abused.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the absence of any reference in Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR to the domestic law of the Member States, the concept of \u2018non-material damage\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, must be given an autonomous and uniform definition specific to EU law (see, to that effect, judgments of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Non-material damage in connection with the processing of personal data)\n, C-300/21, EU:C:2023:370, paragraphs\u00a030 and 44, and of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nGemeinde Ummendorf\n, C-456/22, EU:C:2023:988, paragraph\u00a015).\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court held that it is apparent not only from the wording of Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of recitals\u00a085 and 146 of that regulation, which encourage the acceptance of a broad interpretation of the concept of \u2018non-material damage\u2019 within the meaning of that first provision, but also the objective of ensuring a high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data, which is referred to by the regulation, that the fear experienced by a data subject with regard to a possible misuse of his or her personal data by third parties as a result of an infringement of that regulation is capable, in itself, of constituting \u2018non-material damage\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a082(1) (see, to that effect, judgment of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraphs\u00a079 to 86).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, on the basis of considerations of a literal, systemic and teleological nature, the Court held that the loss of control of the personal data for a short period of time may cause the data subject \u2018non-material damage\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR, giving rise to a right to compensation, subject to that person demonstrating having actually suffered such damage, however minimal, bearing in mind that the mere infringement of the provisions of that regulation is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation on that basis (see, to that effect, judgment of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nGemeinde Ummendorf\n, C-456/22, EU:C:2023:988, paragraphs\u00a018 to 23).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, in the present case, it should be noted that it is consistent both with the wording of Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR and the objective of protection referred to by that regulation that the concept of \u2018non-material damage\u2019 encompasses a situation in which the data subject experiences the well-founded fear, which is for the national court to determine, that some of his or her personal data be subject to dissemination or misuse by third parties in the future, on account of the fact that a document containing those data was provided to an unauthorised third party who was afforded the opportunity to take copies before returning it.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the fact remains that it is for the applicant in an action for compensation under Article\u00a082 of the GDPR to demonstrate the existence of such damage. In particular, a purely hypothetical risk of misuse by an unauthorised third party cannot give rise to compensation. This is so where no third party became aware of the personal data at issue.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the answer to the fifth question is that Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, if a document containing personal data was provided to an unauthorised third party and it was established that that person did not become aware of those personal data, \u2018non-material damage\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, does not exist due to the mere fact that the data subject fears that, following that communication having made possible the making of a copy of that document before its recovery, a dissemination, even abuse, of those data may occur in the future.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticles\u00a05, 24, 32 and 82 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), read together\nmust be interpreted as meaning that in an action for compensation based on Article\u00a082, the fact that the employees of the controller provided to an unauthorised third party in error a document containing personal data is not sufficient, in itself, to consider that the technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller at issue were not \u2018appropriate\u2019, within the meaning of Articles\u00a024 and 32.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a082(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the right to compensation laid down in that provision, in particular in the case of non-material damage, fulfils a compensatory function, in that financial compensation based on that provision must allow the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation to be compensated in full, and not a punitive function.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a082 of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that that article does not require that the severity of the infringement made by the controller be taken into consideration for the purposes of compensation under that provision.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a082(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the person seeking compensation by way of that provision is required to establish not only the infringement of provisions of that regulation, but also that that infringement caused him or her material or non-material damage.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a082(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that if a document containing personal data was provided to an unauthorised third party and it was established that that person did not become aware of those personal data, \u2018non-material damage\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, does not exist due to the mere fact that the data subject fears that, following that communication having made possible the making of a copy of that document before its recovery, a dissemination, even abuse, of those data may occur in the future."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 4 May 2023, C-300/21 (\n\u00d6sterreichische Post\n)\nGeneral data protection

preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Article\u00a082 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ 2016 L\u00a0119, p.\u00a01; \u2018the GDPR\u2019), read in conjunction with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness.\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The request has been made in proceedings between UI and \u00d6sterreichische Post AG concerning the action brought by the former seeking compensation for the non-material damage which he claims to have suffered as a result of the processing by that company of data relating to the political affinities of persons resident in Austria, in particular himself, even though he had not consented to such processing.\n\u00a0\nLegal context\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a010, 75, 85 and 146 of the GDPR are worded as follows:\n\u2018(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the [European] Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and severity, may result from personal data processing which could lead to physical, material or non-material damage, in particular: where the processing may give rise to discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, or any other significant economic or social disadvantage; where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data; where personal data are processed which reveal racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(85)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A personal data breach may, if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical, material or non-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their personal data or limitation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural person concerned.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(146)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer as a result of processing that infringes this Regulation. The controller or processor should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the damage. The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation. This is without prejudice to any claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in [EU] or Member State law. Processing that infringes this Regulation also includes processing that infringes delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this Regulation and Member State law specifying rules of this Regulation. Data subjects should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered.\u00a0\u2026\u2019\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01 of the GDPR, headed \u2018Subject matter and objectives\u2019, provides in paragraphs\u00a01 and 2:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data.\u2019\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a04(1) of that regulation, that article being entitled \u2018Definitions\u2019:\n\u2018For the purposes of this Regulation:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cpersonal data\u201d means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d);\u00a0\u2026\u2019\n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter VIII of the GDPR, entitled \u2018Remedies, liability and penalties\u2019, contains Articles\u00a077 to 84 of that regulation.\n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a077 of that regulation deals with the \u2018right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority\u2019, while Article\u00a078 concerns the \u2018right to an effective judicial remedy against a supervisory authority\u2019.\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, entitled \u2018Right to compensation and liability\u2019, states in paragraphs\u00a01 and 2:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any controller involved in processing shall be liable for the damage caused by processing which infringes this Regulation.\u00a0\u2026\u2019\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a083 of that regulation, entitled \u2018General conditions for imposing administrative fines\u2019, provides in paragraph\u00a01:\n\u2018Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article in respect of infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs\u00a04, 5 and 6 shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\u2019\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a084(1) of that regulation, that article being headed \u2018Penalties\u2019, provides:\n\u2018Member States shall lay down the rules on other penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation in particular for infringements which are not subject to administrative fines pursuant to Article\u00a083, and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. Such penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 2017, \u00d6sterreichische Post, a company incorporated under Austrian law, an address broker, collected information on the political affinities of the Austrian population. Using an algorithm that takes into account various social and demographic criteria, it defined \u2018target group addresses\u2019. The data thus generated were sold to various organisations, to enable them to send targeted advertising.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the course of its activity, \u00d6sterreichische Post processed data which, by way of statistical extrapolation, led it to infer that the applicant in the main proceedings had a high degree of affinity with a certain Austrian political party. That information was not communicated to third parties, but the applicant in the main proceedings, who had not consented to the processing of his personal data, felt offended by the fact that an affinity with the party in question had been attributed to him. The fact that data relating to his supposed political opinions were retained within that company caused him great upset, a loss of confidence and a feeling of exposure. It is apparent from the order for reference that no harm other than those adverse emotional effects of a temporary nature has been established.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the applicant in the main proceedings brought an action before the Landesgericht f\u00fcr Zivilrechtssachen Wien (Regional Court for Civil Matters, Vienna, Austria) seeking, first, an injunction for \u00d6sterreichische Post to cease processing the personal data in question and, second, an order requiring that company to pay him the sum of EUR\u00a01\u00a0000 by way of compensation for the non-material damage which he claims to have suffered. By decision of 14\u00a0July 2020, that court upheld the application for an injunction but rejected the claim for compensation.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On appeal, the Oberlandesgericht Wien (Higher Regional Court, Vienna, Austria) confirmed, by judgment of 9\u00a0December 2020, the decision at first instance. As regards the claim for compensation, that court referred to recitals\u00a075, 85 and 146 of the GDPR and held that the Member States\u2019 provisions of national law on civil liability supplement the provisions of that regulation, in so far as the latter does not contain special rules. In that regard, it noted that, under Austrian law, a breach of the rules on the protection of personal data is not automatically associated with non-material damage and gives rise to a right to compensation only where such damage reaches a certain \u2018threshold of seriousness\u2019. In its view, that is not the case with regard to the negative feelings which the applicant in the main proceedings has invoked.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing the action brought by the two parties in the main proceedings, the Oberster Gerichtshof (Supreme Court, Austria), by interim judgment of 15\u00a0April 2021, did not uphold the appeal on a point of law brought by \u00d6sterreichische Post against the injunction imposed on it. Therefore, only the appeal on a point of law which the applicant in the main proceedings brought against the rejection of his claim for compensation which had been raised against him remains before that court.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In support of its request for a preliminary ruling, the referring court states that it is apparent from recital\u00a0146 of the GDPR that Article\u00a082 of that regulation established its own rules on liability for the protection of personal data, which superseded the rules in force in the Member States. Therefore, the concepts contained in Article\u00a082, in particular the concept of \u2018damage\u2019 referred to in paragraph\u00a01 thereof, should be interpreted autonomously and the conditions for the implementation of that liability should be defined in the light not of the rules of national law, but of the requirements of EU law.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specifically, in the first place, as regards the right to compensation for a breach of personal data protection, that court tends to consider, in the light of the sixth sentence of recital\u00a0146 of the GDPR, that compensation based on Article\u00a082 of that regulation presupposes that material or non-material damage has actually been suffered by the data subject. It argues that the award of such compensation is subject to proof of specific damage distinct from that breach, which does not in itself establish the existence of non-material damage. In its view, recital\u00a075 of that regulation refers to the mere possibility that non-material damage may result from the breaches listed therein and, although recital\u00a085 refers to the risk of a \u2018loss of control\u2019 of the data affected, that risk is, however, uncertain in the present case, since those data were not transmitted to a third party.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards the assessment of the compensation that may be awarded under Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, that court considers that the principle of effectiveness of EU law must have a limited impact, on the grounds that that regulation already provides for severe penalties for breaches thereof and that it is therefore not necessary to award a high level of compensation in addition to ensure its effectiveness. In its view, any compensation due on that basis must be proportionate, effective and dissuasive, so that the damages awarded may fulfil a compensatory function, but not be punitive in nature, which is extraneous to EU law.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, the referring court questions the argument put forward by \u00d6sterreichische Post that the award of such compensation is subject to the condition that the breach of personal data protection has caused particularly serious harm. In that regard, it notes that recital\u00a0146 of the GDPR advocates a broad interpretation of the concept of \u2018damage\u2019 within the meaning of that regulation. It takes the view that non-material damage must be compensated, under Article\u00a082 of that regulation, if it is tangible, even if it is minor. By contrast, such damage should not be compensated if it appears to be completely negligible, as would be the case for the merely unpleasant feelings that are typically associated with such a breach.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Oberster Gerichtshof (Supreme Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the award of compensation under Article\u00a082 of [the GDPR] also require, in addition to infringement of provisions of the GDPR, that an applicant must have suffered harm, or is the infringement of provisions of the GDPR in itself sufficient for the award of compensation?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the assessment of the compensation depend on further EU-law requirements in addition to the principles of effectiveness and equivalence?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it compatible with EU law to take the view that the award of compensation for non-material damage presupposes the existence of a consequence [or effect] of the infringement of at least some weight that goes beyond the upset caused by that infringement?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nWhether Questions\u00a0\n1 and 2 are admissible\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicant in the main proceedings submits, in essence, that the first question referred is inadmissible on the ground that it is hypothetical. He maintains, first of all, that his claim for compensation is not based on the \u2018mere\u2019 infringement of a provision of the GDPR. Next, the order for reference refers to the fact that there is agreement that compensation is due only if such infringement is accompanied by damage actually suffered. Finally, in his view, the only point that appears not to be common ground between the parties in the main proceedings is whether the damage must exceed a certain \u2018threshold of seriousness\u2019. If the Court were to answer the third question referred in that regard in the negative\u00a0\u2013 as the applicant himself proposes\u00a0\u2013 Question\u00a01 would then be of no use for the resolution of that dispute.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicant in the main proceedings also claims that the second question referred is inadmissible, on the ground that it is both very broad in content and too vague in wording, since the referring court refers to \u2018EU-law requirements\u2019, without specifying any such requirement.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it must be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court, which enjoy a presumption of relevance. If, therefore, the question referred concerns the interpretation or validity of a rule of EU law, the Court is, in principle, required to give a ruling, unless it is quite obvious that the interpretation sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or to its purposes or where the problem is hypothetical or the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the question submitted to it (see, to that effect, judgments of 15\u00a0December 1995, \nBosman\n, C-415/93, EU:C:1995:463, paragraph\u00a061; of 7\u00a0September 1999, \nBeck and Bergdorf\n, C-355/97, EU:C:1999:391, paragraph\u00a022; and of 5\u00a0May 2022, \nZagreba\u010dka banka\n, C-567/20, EU:C:2022:352, paragraph\u00a043 and the case-law cited).\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present proceedings, Question\u00a01 concerns the conditions required for the exercise of the right to compensation provided for in Article\u00a082 of the GDPR. Furthermore, it is not obvious that the interpretation sought bears no relation to the dispute in the main action or that the problem raised is hypothetical. This dispute concerns a claim for compensation falling within the rules established by the GDPR for the protection of personal data. Moreover, that question seeks to determine whether, for the purposes of applying the rules on liability laid down by that regulation, it is necessary for the data subject to have suffered damage that is distinct from the infringement of that regulation.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards Question\u00a02, it has already been held that the mere fact that the Court is called upon to give a decision in abstract and general terms cannot have the effect of rendering a request for a preliminary ruling inadmissible (judgment of 15\u00a0November 2007, \nInternational Mail Spain\n, C-162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph\u00a024). A question submitted in such terms may be considered to be hypothetical, and therefore inadmissible, if the order for reference does not contain the minimum of explanatory material that would be necessary to establish a link between the question and the dispute in the main proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 8\u00a0July 2021, \nSanresa\n, C-295/20, EU:C:2021:556, paragraphs\u00a069 and 70).\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, that is not the case here, since the referring court explains that Question\u00a02 is based on a doubt as to whether, in the context of the assessment of the damages possibly owed by \u00d6sterreichische Post due to a breach of the provisions of the GDPR, it is necessary to ensure compliance not only with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness, which are referred to in that question, but also with any other EU-law requirements. In that context, the absence of more precise information than that provided by that court concerning those principles does not deprive the Court of its ability to provide a useful interpretation of the relevant rules of EU law.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, Questions\u00a01 and 2 are admissible.\n\u00a0\nSubstance\n\u00a0\nQuestion\u00a01\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question\u00a01 the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the mere infringement of the provisions of that regulation is sufficient to confer a right to compensation.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union (judgments of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a081, and of 10\u00a0February 2022, \nShareWood Switzerland\n, C-595/20, EU:C:2022:86, paragraph\u00a021), having regard, inter alia, to the wording of the provision concerned and to its context (see, to that effect, judgments of 15\u00a0April 2021, \nThe North of England P & I Association\n, C-786/19, EU:C:2021:276, paragraph\u00a048, and of 10\u00a0June 2021, \nKRONE\u00a0\n\u2013 \nVerlag\n, C-65/20, EU:C:2021:471, paragraph\u00a025).\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The GDPR makes no reference to the law of the Member States as regards the meaning and scope of the terms set out in Article\u00a082 of that regulation, in particular as regards the concepts of \u2018material or non-material damage\u2019 and of \u2018compensation for the damage suffered\u2019. It follows that those terms must be regarded, for the purposes of the application of that regulation, as constituting autonomous concepts of EU law which must be interpreted in a uniform manner in all of the Member States.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, as regards the wording of Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, it should be recalled that paragraph\u00a01 of that article states that \u2018any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered\u2019.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from the wording of that provision that the existence of \u2018damage\u2019 which has been \u2018suffered\u2019 constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation laid down in that provision, as does the existence of an infringement of the GDPR and of a causal link between that damage and that infringement, those three conditions being cumulative.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it cannot be held that any \u2018infringement\u2019 of the provisions of the GDPR, by itself, confers that right to compensation on the data subject, as defined in Article\u00a04(1) of that regulation. Such an interpretation would run counter to the wording of Article\u00a082(1) of that regulation.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it is important to point out that the separate reference to \u2018damage\u2019 and to an \u2018infringement\u2019 in Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR would be superfluous if the EU legislature had considered that an infringement of the provisions of that regulation could be sufficient, by itself and in any event, to give rise to a right to compensation.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, the foregoing literal interpretation is supported by the context of that provision.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a082(2) of the GDPR, which specifies the rules on liability\u00a0\u2013 the principle of which is established in paragraph\u00a01 of that article\u00a0\u2013 reproduces the three conditions necessary to give rise to the right to compensation, namely processing of personal data that infringes the provisions of the GDPR, damage suffered by the data subject, and a causal link between that unlawful processing and that damage.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the clarifications provided by recitals\u00a075, 85 and 146 of the GDPR support that interpretation. First, recital\u00a0146, which specifically concerns the right to compensation provided for in Article\u00a082(1) of that regulation, refers, in its first sentence, to \u2018damage which a person may suffer as a result of processing that infringes this Regulation\u2019. Second, recitals\u00a075 and 85 state, respectively, that \u2018the risk\u00a0\u2026 may result from personal data processing which could lead to\u00a0\u2026 damage\u2019 and that a \u2018personal data breach may\u00a0\u2026 result in\u00a0\u2026 damage\u2019. It follows, first, that the occurrence of damage in the context of such processing is only potential; second, that an infringement of the GDPR does not necessarily result in damage, and, third, that there must be a causal link between the infringement in question and the damage suffered by the data subject in order to establish a right to compensation.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The literal interpretation of Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR is further supported by a comparison with other provisions also contained in Chapter VIII of that regulation, which governs, inter alia, the various remedies to protect the rights of the data subject in case of processing of his or her personal data that is allegedly contrary to the provisions of that regulation.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that Articles\u00a077 and 78 of the GDPR, contained in that chapter, provide for legal remedies before or against a supervisory authority, in case of an alleged infringement of that regulation, without it being stated that the data subject must have suffered \u2018damage\u2019 in order to be able to bring such actions, contrary to the wording of Article\u00a082 of the GDPR with regard to actions for compensation. That difference in wording is indicative of the importance of the \u2018damage\u2019 criterion, and therefore of its distinctive nature as against the \u2018infringement\u2019 criterion, for the purposes of claims for compensation based on the GDPR.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, Articles\u00a083 and 84 of the GDPR, which permit the imposition of administrative fines and other penalties, have essentially a punitive purpose and are not conditional on the existence of individual damage. The relationship between the rules set out in Article\u00a082 and those set out in Articles\u00a083 and 84 shows that there is a difference between those two categories of provisions, but also complementarity, in terms of encouraging compliance with the GDPR, it being observed that the right of any person to seek compensation for damage reinforces the operational nature of the protection rules laid down by that regulation and is likely to discourage the reoccurrence of unlawful conduct.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last, it is important to note that the fourth sentence of recital\u00a0146 of the GDPR states that the rules laid down by the GDPR apply without prejudice to any claims for damages deriving from the violation of other rules of EU or Member State law.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all of the foregoing reasons, the answer to Question\u00a01 is that Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the mere infringement of the provisions of that regulation is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation.\n\u00a0\nQuestion\u00a03\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question\u00a03, which it is appropriate to examine before Question\u00a02, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as precluding a national rule or practice which makes compensation for non-material damage, within the meaning of that provision, subject to the condition that the damage suffered by the data subject has reached a certain degree of seriousness.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that, as has been pointed out in paragraph 30 of the present judgment, the concept of \u2018damage\u2019 and, specifically in the present case, the concept of \u2018non-material damage\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, must be given an autonomous and uniform definition specific to EU law, in the absence of any reference to the domestic law of the Member States.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, the GDPR does not define the concept of \u2018damage\u2019 for the purposes of the application of this instrument. Article\u00a082 of that regulation confines itself to expressly stating that not only \u2018material damage\u2019 but also \u2018non-material damage\u2019 may give rise to a right to compensation, without any reference being made to any threshold of seriousness.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, the context of that provision also tends to indicate that the right to compensation is not subject to the condition that the damage in question has reached a certain threshold of seriousness. The third sentence of recital\u00a0146 of the GDPR states that \u2018the concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation\u2019. It would be contrary to that broad conception of \u2018damage\u2019, favoured by the EU legislature, if that concept were limited solely to damage of a certain degree of seriousness.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third and last place, such an interpretation is supported by the objectives pursued by the GDPR. In that regard, it must be borne in mind that the third sentence of recital\u00a0146 of that regulation expressly calls for an interpretation of the concept of \u2018damage\u2019, within the meaning of the regulation, which \u2018fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation\u2019.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent, in particular, from recital\u00a010 of the GDPR that the objectives of the GDPR are, inter alia, to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data within the European Union and, to that end, to ensure consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union (see, to that effect, judgments of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0101, and of 12\u00a0January 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Information relating to the recipients of personal data)\n, C-154/21, EU:C:2023:3, paragraph\u00a044 and the case-law cited).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Making compensation for non-material damage subject to a certain threshold of seriousness would risk undermining the coherence of the rules established by the GDPR, since the graduation of such a threshold, on which the possibility or otherwise of obtaining that compensation would depend, would be liable to fluctuate according to the assessment of the courts seised.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact remains that the interpretation thus adopted cannot be understood as meaning that a person concerned by an infringement of the GDPR which had negative consequences for him or her would be relieved of the need to demonstrate that those consequences constitute non-material damage within the meaning of Article\u00a082 of that regulation.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing reasons, the answer to Question\u00a03 is that Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as precluding a national rule or practice which makes compensation for non-material damage, within the meaning of that provision, subject to the condition that the damage suffered by the data subject has reached a certain degree of seriousness.\n\u00a0\nQuestion\u00a02\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question\u00a02 the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a082 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, for the purposes of determining the amount of damages payable under the right to compensation enshrined in that article, national courts must apply the domestic rules of each Member State relating to the extent of financial compensation, having due regard in particular to the principles of equivalence and effectiveness of EU law.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, in the absence of EU rules on the matter, it is for the national legal order of each Member State to establish procedural rules for actions intended to safeguard the rights of individuals, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy, on condition, however, that those rules are not, in situations covered by EU law, less favourable than those governing similar domestic situations (principle of equivalence) and that they do not make it excessively difficult or impossible in practice to exercise the rights conferred by EU law (principle of effectiveness) (see, to that effect, judgments of 13\u00a0December 2017, \nEl Hassani\n, C-403/16, EU:C:2017:960, paragraph\u00a026, and of 15\u00a0September 2022, \nUniqa Versicherungen\n, C-18/21, EU:C:2022:682, paragraph\u00a036).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it should be noted that the GDPR does not contain any provision intended to define the rules on the assessment of the damages to which a data subject, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of that regulation, may be entitled under Article\u00a082 thereof, where an infringement of that regulation has caused him or her harm. Therefore, in the absence of rules of EU law governing the matter, it is for the legal system of each Member State to prescribe the detailed rules governing actions for safeguarding rights which individuals derive from Article\u00a082 and, in particular, the criteria for determining the extent of the compensation payable in that context, subject to compliance with those principles of equivalence and effectiveness (see, by analogy, judgment of 13\u00a0July 2006, \nManfredi and Others\n, C-295/04 to C-298/04, EU:C:2006:461, paragraphs\u00a092 and 98).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the principle of equivalence, in the present proceedings, the Court has nothing before it that is capable of raising doubts as to whether national legislation applicable to the dispute in the main proceedings complies with that principle and, therefore, of showing that that principle may have a specific effect in the context of that dispute.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the principle of effectiveness, it is for the referring court to determine whether the detailed rules laid down in Austrian law for the determination, by the courts, of damages due under the right to compensation enshrined in Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, make it impossible in practice or excessively difficult to exercise the rights conferred by EU law, and more specifically by that regulation.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should be noted that the sixth sentence of recital\u00a0146 of the GDPR states that that instrument is intended to ensure \u2018full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered\u2019.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in view of the compensatory function of the right to compensation under Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, as the Advocate General pointed out, in essence, in points\u00a039, 49 and 52 of his Opinion, financial compensation based on that provision must be regarded as \u2018full and effective\u2019 if it allows the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation to be compensated in its entirety, without there being any need, for the purposes of such compensation for the damage in its entirety, to require the payment of punitive damages.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to Question\u00a02 is that Article\u00a082 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, for the purposes of determining the amount of damages payable under the right to compensation enshrined in that article, national courts must apply the domestic rules of each Member State relating to the extent of financial compensation, provided that the principles of equivalence and effectiveness of EU law are complied with.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a082(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the mere infringement of the provisions of that regulation is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a082(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as precluding a national rule or practice which makes compensation for non-material damage, within the meaning of that provision, subject to the condition that the damage suffered by the data subject has reached a certain degree of seriousness.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a082 of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that for the purposes of determining the amount of damages payable under the right to compensation enshrined in that article, national courts must apply the domestic rules of each Member State relating to the extent of financial compensation, provided that the principles of equivalence and effectiveness of EU law are complied with."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f),

Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 17 Oct 2013, C-291/12 (\nSchwarz\n)\nGeneral data protection law \n >

Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 of 13\u00a0December 2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States (OJ 2004 L 385, p.\u00a01), as amended by Regulation (EC) No\u00a0444/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6\u00a0May 2009 (OJ\u00a02009 L 142, p.\u00a01; corrigendum: OJ 2009 L 188, p.\u00a0127) (\u2018Regulation

latter\u2019s refusal to issue him with a passport unless his fingerprints were taken at the same time so that they could be stored on that passport.\n\u00a0\nLegal context \n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 2 of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L 281, p.\u00a031) provides:\n\u2018For the purposes of this Directive:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cpersonal data\u201d shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cprocessing of personal data\u201d (\u201cprocessing\u201d) shall mean any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction;\n\u2026\u2019\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46 provides:\n\u2018Member States shall provide that personal data may be processed only if:\n\u2026 \n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party to whom the data are disclosed\u2019.\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals 2, 3 and 8 in the preamble to Regulation No 2252/2004 state:\n\u2018(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Minimum security standards for passports were introduced by a Resolution of the representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, on 17 October 2000 [supplementing the resolutions of 23\u00a0June 1981, 30\u00a0June 1982, 14\u00a0July 1986 and 10\u00a0July 1995 as regards the security characteristics of passports and other travel documents (OJ 2000 C\u00a0310, p.\u00a01)]. It is now appropriate to upgrade this Resolution by a Community measure in order to achieve enhanced harmonised security standards for passports and travel documents to protect against falsification. At the same time biometric identifiers should be integrated in the passport or travel document in order to establish a reliable link between the genuine holder and the document.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The harmonisation of security features and the integration of biometric identifiers is an important step towards the use of new elements in the perspective of future developments at European level, which render the travel document more secure and establish a more reliable link between the holder and the passport and the travel document as an important contribution to ensuring that it is protected against fraudulent use. The specifications of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), and in particular those set out in Document 9303 on machine readable travel documents, should be taken into account.\n\u2026 \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the personal data to be processed in the context of passports and travel documents, Directive [95/46] applies. It should be ensured that no further information shall be stored in the passport unless provided for in this Regulation, its annex or unless it is mentioned in the relevant travel document.\u2019\n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under recital 5 in the preamble to Regulation No 444/2009:\n\u2018Regulation [No 2252/2004] requires biometric data to be collected and stored in the storage medium of passports and travel documents with a view to issuing such documents. This is without prejudice to any other use or storage of these data in accordance with national legislation of Member States. Regulation [No 2252/2004] does not provide a legal base for setting up or maintaining databases for storage of those data in Member States, which is strictly a matter of national law.\u2019\n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article 1(1) to (2a) of Regulation No 2252/2004:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Passports and travel documents issued by Member States shall comply with the minimum security standards set out in the Annex.\n\u2026\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Passports and travel documents shall include a highly secure storage medium which shall contain a facial image. Member States shall also include two fingerprints taken flat in interoperable formats. The data shall be secured and the storage medium shall have sufficient capacity and capability to guarantee the integrity, the authenticity and the confidentiality of the data.\n2a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following persons shall be exempt from the requirement to give fingerprints:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Children under the age of 12 years.\n\u2026 \n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0persons, where fingerprinting is physically impossible.\u2019\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 2(a) of that regulation provides:\n\u2018Additional technical specifications \u2026 for passports and travel documents relating to the following shall be established in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 5(2):\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0additional security features and requirements including enhanced anti-forgery, counterfeiting and falsification standards\u2019.\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 3(1) of that regulation provides: \n\u2018In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 5(2) it may be decided that the specifications referred to in Article 2 shall be secret and not be published. In that case, they shall be made available only to the bodies designated by the Member States as responsible for printing and to persons duly authorised by a Member State or the [European] Commission.\u2019\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article 4(3) of that regulation: \n\u2018Biometric data shall be collected and stored in the storage medium of passports and travel documents with a view to issuing such documents. For the purpose of this Regulation the biometric features in passports and travel documents shall only be used for verifying:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the authenticity of the passport or travel document;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the identity of the holder by means of directly available comparable features when the passport or travel document is required to be produced by law.\nThe checking of the additional security features shall be carried out without prejudice to Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\u00a0March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) [(OJ 2006 L 105, p.\u00a01)]. The failure of the matching in itself shall not affect the validity of the passport or travel document for the purpose of the crossing of external borders.\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Schwarz applied to the Stadt Bochum for a passport, but refused at that time to have his fingerprints taken. After the Stadt Bochum rejected his application, Mr\u00a0Schwarz brought an action before the referring court in which he requested that the city be ordered to issue him with a passport without taking his fingerprints.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before that court, Mr Schwarz disputes the validity of the regulation (Regulation No 2252/2004) which created the obligation to take the fingerprints of persons applying for passports. He submits that that regulation does not have an appropriate legal basis and is vitiated by a procedural defect. In addition, he claims that Article 1(2) of that regulation infringes the right to the protection of personal data laid down, in general terms, in Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019), which relates to the right to respect for private life, and explicitly in Article 8 thereof.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the Verwaltungsgericht Gelsenkirchen (Administrative Court, Gelsenkirchen) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018Is Article 1(2) of [Regulation No 2252/2004] to be considered valid?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the question referred\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its question, read in the light of the order for reference, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004 is invalid on the grounds, in the first place, that the regulation has an inappropriate legal basis; in the second, that the procedure for adopting that regulation is vitiated by a defect and, in the third, that Article 1(2) of that regulation breaches certain fundamental rights of the holders of passports issued in accordance with that provision.\n\u00a0\nLegal basis of Regulation No 2252/2004\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court seeks to establish whether it was permissible for the Council to adopt Regulation No 2252/2004 on the basis of Article 62(2)(a) EC, given that that provision does not explicitly refer to any power to regulate issues relating to passports and travel documents issued to citizens of the Union (\u2018passports\u2019).\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that Article 62(2)(a) EC, in the version applicable from 1\u00a0May 1999 to 30\u00a0November 2009, on the basis of which Regulation No 2252/2004 was adopted, was part of Title IV of the EC Treaty, entitled \u2018Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons\u2019. That provision stated that the Council of the European Union, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 67 EC, was, within a period of five years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to adopt \u2018measures on the crossing of the external borders of the Member States which shall establish \u2026 standards and procedures to be followed by Member States in carrying out checks on persons at such borders\u2019.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from both the wording and the aim of Article 62(2)(a) EC that this provision authorised the Council to regulate how checks were to be carried out at the external borders of the European Union in order to ascertain the identity of persons crossing those borders. Such checks necessarily requiring documents to be presented that make it possible to establish that identity, Article 62(2)(a) EC therefore authorised the Council to adopt legal provisions relating to such documents and to passports in particular.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to whether Article 62(2)(a) EC authorised the Council to adopt measures establishing standards and procedures in connection with the issuing of passports to citizens of the Union, it should be noted, first, that the provision referred to checks on \u2018persons\u2019 without providing further details. Thus, it must be presumed that the provision was intended to cover not only third-country nationals, but also citizens of the Union and, hence, their passports.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as also confirmed by the Explanatory Memorandum to the proposal for a Council Regulation on standards for security features and biometrics in EU citizens\u2019 passports [(COM(2004) 116 final)] as submitted by the Commission, harmonised security standards for passports may be required in order to avoid passports having security features which lag behind those provided for by the uniform format for visas and residence permits for third-country nationals. In those circumstances, the EU legislature has the authority to provide for similar security features in respect of passports held by EU citizens, in so far as such authority helps to prevent those passports from becoming targets for falsification or fraudulent use.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that Article 62(2)(a) EC was an appropriate legal basis for adopting Regulation No 2252/2004 and, in particular, Article 1(2) thereof.\n\u00a0\nProcedure for adopting Regulation No 2252/2004\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court seeks to establish whether Article 1(2) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 is valid in view of the procedural requirements listed in Article 67(1) EC. In that regard, that court refers to the line of argument put forward by the applicant, who is of the view that, contrary to the requirements of the latter provision, the European Parliament was not properly consulted in the course of the legislative procedure. According to Mr Schwarz, the Commission\u2019s proposal submitted to the Parliament for consultation purposes provided for the storage of images of fingerprints on passports to be merely an option for the Member States, changing into an obligation after the Parliament had been consulted. That represented a significant amendment; as a result, under Article 67 EC, further consultation of the Parliament was necessary.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it is common ground that Regulation No 444/2009 has replaced the wording of Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004 \u2013 on the subject of which, according to the applicant, the Parliament was not consulted \u2013 with new wording which reproduces the obligation to store images of fingerprints in passports. Regulation No 444/2009 being applicable to the facts in the case before the referring court and adopted following the joint decision procedure and, so, with the full involvement of the Parliament in its role as co-legislator, the ground for invalidity relied on by the applicant in that regard is ineffective.\n\u00a0\nFundamental rights to respect for private life and the protection of personal data\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court must examine whether taking fingerprints and storing them in passports, as provided for in Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004, constitutes a threat to the rights to respect for private life and the protection of personal data. If so, it must then be ascertained whether such a threat can be justified.\n\u00a0Whether such a threat exists\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 7 of the Charter states, inter alia, that everyone has the right to respect for his or her private life. Under Article 8(1) thereof, everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from a joint reading of those articles that, as a general rule, any processing of personal data by a third party may constitute a threat to those rights.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the outset, it should be borne in mind that the right to respect for private life with regard to the processing of personal data concerns any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (Joined Cases C-92/09 and C-93/09 \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n [2010] ECR I-11063, paragraph 52, and Joined Cases C-468/10 and C-469/10 \nASNEF and FECEMD\n [2011] ECR I-12181, paragraph 42).\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fingerprints constitute personal data, as they objectively contain unique information about individuals which allows those individuals to be identified with precision (see, to that effect, in particular, European Court of Human Rights judgment in \nS. and Marper v. United Kingdom\n, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 84, ECHR 2008).\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, as can be seen from Article 2(b) of Directive 95/46, processing of personal data means any operation performed upon such data by a third party, such as the collecting, recording, storage, consultation or use thereof.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004 means that national authorities are to take a person\u2019s fingerprints and that those fingerprints are to be kept in the storage medium in that person\u2019s passport. Such measures must therefore be viewed as a processing of personal data.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the taking and storing of fingerprints by the national authorities which is governed by Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004 constitutes a threat to the rights to respect for private life and the protection of personal data. Accordingly, it must be ascertained whether that twofold threat is justified.\n\u00a0Justification\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article 8(2) of the Charter, personal data cannot be processed except on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, concerning the condition requiring the consent of persons applying for passports before their fingerprints can be taken, it should be noted that, as a general rule, it is essential for citizens of the Union to own a passport in order, for example, to travel to non-member countries and that that document must contain fingerprints pursuant to Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004. Therefore, citizens of the Union wishing to make such journeys are not free to object to the processing of their fingerprints. In those circumstances, persons applying for passports cannot be deemed to have consented to that processing.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, regarding whether the processing of fingerprints can be justified on the basis of some other legitimate basis laid down by law, it should be borne in mind from the outset that the rights recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society (see, to that effect, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, paragraph 48, and Case C-543/09 \nDeutsche Telekom\n [2011] ECR I-3441, paragraph 51).\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, Article 52(1) of the Charter allows for limitations of the exercise of those rights, so long as those limitations are provided for by law, respect the essence of those rights, and, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, in the present case, it is common ground that the limitation arising from the taking and storing of fingerprints when issuing passports must be considered to be provided for by law, for the purposes of Article 52(1) of the Charter, since those operations are provided for by Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, concerning the objective of general interest underlying that limitation, it can be seen that Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004, when read in the light of recitals 2 and 3 of that regulation, has two specific aims: the first, to prevent the falsification of passports and the second, to prevent fraudulent use thereof, that is to say, use by persons other than their genuine holders.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, Article 1(2) is designed, through pursuit of those aims, to prevent, inter alia, illegal entry into the European Union.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it must be found that Article 1(2) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 pursues an objective of general interest recognised by the Union.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, it is not apparent from the evidence available to the Court, nor has it been claimed, that the limitations placed on the exercise of the rights recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter in the present case do not respect the essence of those rights.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, the Court must establish whether the limitations placed on those rights are proportionate to the aims pursued by Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 and, by extension, to the objective of preventing illegal entry into the European Union. It must therefore be ascertained whether the measures implemented by that regulation are appropriate for attaining those aims and do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve them (see \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, paragraph 74).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to whether Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004 is appropriate for attaining the aim of preventing the falsification of passports, it is common ground that the storage of fingerprints on a highly secure storage medium as provided for by that provision requires sophisticated technology. Therefore such storage is likely to reduce the risk of passports being falsified and to facilitate the work of the authorities responsible for checking the authenticity of passports at EU borders.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Schwarz submits that the method of ascertaining identity using fingerprints is not appropriate for attaining the aim of preventing fraudulent use of passports, since there have been mistakes when implementing that method in practice; given that no two digital copies of a set of fingerprints are ever identical, systems using that method are not sufficiently accurate, resulting in not inconsiderable rates of unauthorised persons being incorrectly accepted and of authorised persons being incorrectly rejected.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, however, it must be held that the fact that the method is not wholly reliable is not decisive. Although that method does not prevent all unauthorised persons from being accepted, it is enough that it significantly reduces the likelihood of such acceptance that would exist if that method were not used.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although it is true that the use of fingerprints as a means of ascertaining identity may, on an exceptional basis, lead to authorised persons being rejected by mistake, the fact remains that a mismatch between the fingerprints of the holder of a passport and the data in that document does not mean that the person concerned will automatically be refused entry to the European Union, as is pointed out in the second subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 2252/2004. A mismatch of that kind will simply draw the competent authorities\u2019 attention to the person concerned and will result in a more detailed check of that person in order definitively to establish his identity.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the taking and storing of fingerprints referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004 are appropriate for attaining the aims pursued by that regulation and, by extension, the objective of preventing illegal entry to the European Union.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, in assessing whether such processing is necessary, the legislature is obliged, inter alia, to examine whether it is possible to envisage measures which will interfere less with the rights recognised by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter but will still contribute effectively to the objectives of the European Union rules in question (see, to that effect, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, paragraph 86).\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, with regard to the aim of protecting against the fraudulent use of passports, it must in the first place be considered whether the threat posed by the measure of taking fingerprints does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that aim.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it is be borne in mind, on the one hand, that that action involves no more than the taking of prints of two fingers, which can, moreover, generally be seen by others, so that this is not an operation of an intimate nature. Nor does it cause any particular physical or mental discomfort to the person affected any more than when that person\u2019s facial image is taken.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that those fingerprints are to be taken in addition to the facial image. However, the combination of two operations designed to identify persons may not \na priori\n be regarded as giving rise in itself to a greater threat to the rights recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter than if each of those two operations were to be considered in isolation.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, as regards the case in the main proceedings, nothing in the case file submitted to the Court permits a finding that the fact that fingerprints and a facial image are taken at the same time would, by reason of that fact alone, give rise to greater interference with those rights.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, it should also be noted that the only real alternative to the taking of fingerprints raised in the course of the proceedings before the Court is an iris scan. Nothing in the case file submitted to the Court suggests that the latter procedure would interfere less with the rights recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter than the taking of fingerprints.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, with regard to the effectiveness of those two methods, it is common ground that iris-recognition technology is not yet as advanced as fingerprint-recognition technology. In addition, the procedure for iris recognition is currently significantly more expensive than the procedure for comparing fingerprints and is, for that reason, less suitable for general use.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Court has not been made aware of any measures which would be both sufficiently effective in helping to achieve the aim of protecting against the fraudulent use of passports and less of a threat to the rights recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter than the measures deriving from the method based on the use of fingerprints.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, in order for Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004 to be justified in the light of that aim, it is also crucial that the processing of any fingerprints taken pursuant to that provision should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that aim.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the legislature must ensure that there are specific guarantees that the processing of such data will be effectively protected from misuse and abuse (see, to that effect, European Court of Human Rights judgment, \nS. and Marper\n, \u00a7\u00a0103).\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, it should be noted that Article 4(3) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 explicitly states that fingerprints may be used only for verifying the authenticity of a passport and the identity of its holder.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, that regulation ensures protection against the risk of data including fingerprints being read by unauthorised persons. In that regard, Article 1(2) of that regulation makes it clear that such data are to be kept in a highly secure storage medium in the passport of the person concerned.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the referring court is uncertain, in the light of its assessment, whether Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004 is proportionate in view of the risk that, once fingerprints have been taken pursuant to that provision, the \u2013 extremely high quality \u2013 data will be stored, perhaps centrally, and used for purposes other than those provided for by that regulation.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is true that fingerprints play a particular role in the field of identifying persons in general. Thus, the identification techniques of comparing fingerprints taken in a particular place with those stored in a database make it possible to establish whether a certain person is in that particular place, whether in the context of a criminal investigation or in order to monitor that person indirectly.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it should be borne in mind that Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004 does not provide for the storage of fingerprints except within the passport itself, which belongs to the holder alone.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The regulation not providing for any other form or method of storing those fingerprints, it cannot in and of itself, as is pointed out by recital 5 of Regulation No 444/2009, be interpreted as providing a legal basis for the centralised storage of data collected thereunder or for the use of such data for purposes other than that of preventing illegal entry into the European Union.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the arguments put forward by the referring court concerning the risks linked to possible centralisation cannot, in any event, affect the validity of that regulation and would have, should the case arise, to be examined in the course of an action brought before the competent courts against legislation providing for a centralised fingerprint base.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, it must be held that Article 1(2) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 does not imply any processing of fingerprints that would go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the aim of protecting against the fraudulent use of passports.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the interference arising from Article 1(2) of Regulation No\u00a02252/2004 is justified by its aim of protecting against the fraudulent use of passports.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, there is no longer any need to examine whether the measures put into effect by that regulation are necessary in view of its other aim (namely, preventing the falsification of passports).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that examination of that question has revealed nothing capable of affecting the validity of Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules:\nExamination of the question referred has revealed nothing capable of affecting the validity of Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 of 13\u00a0December 2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6\u00a0May 2009."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}
