The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 16 Jul 2020, C-311/18 (\nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n)\nGeneral data

and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and as regards the exercise of the corresponding rights; such safeguards may in particular result from appropriate contractual clauses.\n\u2026\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the Commission decides, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article\u00a031(2), that certain standard contractual clauses

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46 (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ 2016 L\u00a0119, p.\u00a01; \u2018the GDPR\u2019).\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a06, 10, 101, 103, 104, 107 to 109, 114, 116 and 141 of the GDPR state:\n\u2018(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both private companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally. Technology has transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations, while ensuring a high level of the protection of personal data.\n\u2026\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation. In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the processing of special categories of personal data (\u201csensitive data\u201d). To that extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.\n\u2026\n(101)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flows of personal data to and from countries outside the Union and international organisations are necessary for the expansion of international trade and international cooperation. The increase in these flows has raised new challenges and concerns with regard to the protection of personal data. However, when personal data are transferred from the Union to controllers, processors or other recipients in third countries or to international organisations, the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation should not be undermined, including in cases of onward transfers of personal data from the third country or international organisation to controllers, processors in the same or another third country or international organisation. In any event, transfers to third countries and international organisations may only be carried out in full compliance with this Regulation. A transfer could take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in the provisions of this Regulation relating to the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations are complied with by the controller or processor.\n\u2026\n(103)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission may decide with effect for the entire Union that a third country, a territory or specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation, offers an adequate level of data protection, thus providing legal certainty and uniformity throughout the Union as regards the third country or international organisation which is considered to provide such level of protection. In such cases, transfers of personal data to that third country or international organisation may take place without the need to obtain any further authorisation. The Commission may also decide, having given notice and a full statement setting out the reasons to the third country or international organisation, to revoke such a decision.\n(104)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In line with the fundamental values on which the Union is founded, in particular the protection of human rights, the Commission should, in its assessment of the third country, or of a territory or specified sector within a third country, take into account how a particular third country respects the rule of law, access to justice as well as international human rights norms and standards and its general and sectoral law, including legislation concerning public security, defence and national security as well as public order and criminal law. The adoption of an adequacy decision with regard to a territory or a specified sector in a third country should take into account clear and objective criteria, such as specific processing activities and the scope of applicable legal standards and legislation in force in the third country. The third country should offer guarantees ensuring an adequate level of protection essentially equivalent to that ensured within the Union, in particular where personal data are processed in one or several specific sectors. In particular, the third country should ensure effective independent data protection supervision and should provide for cooperation mechanisms with the Member States\u2019 data protection authorities, and the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights and effective administrative and judicial redress.\n\u2026\n(107)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission may recognise that a third country, a territory or a specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection. Consequently the transfer of personal data to that third country or international organisation should be prohibited, unless the requirements in this Regulation relating to transfers subject to appropriate safeguards, including binding corporate rules, and derogations for specific situations are fulfilled. In that case, provision should be made for consultations between the Commission and such third countries or international organisations. The Commission should, in a timely manner, inform the third country or international organisation of the reasons and enter into consultations with it in order to remedy the situation.\n(108)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the absence of an adequacy decision, the controller or processor should take measures to compensate for the lack of data protection in a third country by way of appropriate safeguards for the data subject. Such appropriate safeguards may consist of making use of binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority or contractual clauses authorised by a supervisory authority. Those safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union, including the availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies, including to obtain effective administrative or judicial redress and to claim compensation, in the Union or in a third country. They should relate in particular to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing, the principles of data protection by design and by default.\u00a0\u2026\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The possibility for the controller or processor to use standard data-protection clauses adopted by the Commission or by a supervisory authority should prevent controllers or processors neither from including the standard data-protection clauses in a wider contract, such as a contract between the processor and another processor, nor from adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, the standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission or by a supervisory authority or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of the data subjects. Controllers and processors should be encouraged to provide additional safeguards via contractual commitments that supplement standard protection clauses.\n\u2026\n(114)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any case, where the Commission has taken no decision on the adequate level of data protection in a third country, the controller or processor should make use of solutions that provide data subjects with enforceable and effective rights as regards the processing of their data in the Union once those data have been transferred so that that they will continue to benefit from fundamental rights and safeguards.\n\u2026\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When personal data moves across borders outside the Union it may put at increased risk the ability of natural persons to exercise data protection rights in particular to protect themselves from the unlawful use or disclosure of that information. At the same time, supervisory authorities may find that they are unable to pursue complaints or conduct investigations relating to the activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventative or remedial powers, inconsistent legal regimes, and practical obstacles like resource constraints.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(141)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every data subject should have the right to lodge a complaint with a single supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, and the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance with Article\u00a047 of the Charter if the data subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed or where the supervisory authority does not act on a complaint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses a complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject.\u00a0\u2026\u2019\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a02(1) and (2) of the GDPR provides:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Chapter\u00a02 of Title\u00a0V of the TEU;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.\u2019\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04 of the GDPR provides:\n\u2018For the purposes of this Regulation:\n\u2026\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cprocessing\u201d means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\n\u2026\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201ccontroller\u201d means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cprocessor\u201d, means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201crecipient\u201d means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not.

In order to enhance transparency and to reflect the legal nature of these commitments, each of the documents listed and annexed to this decision will be published in the U.S. Federal Register.\u2019\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission\u2019s assessment of those limitations and guarantees is summarised in recitals\u00a067 to 135 of the Privacy Shield Decision, while the Commission\u2019s conclusions on the adequate level of protection in the context of the EU-US Privacy Shield are set out in recitals\u00a0136 to 141 thereof.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, Recitals\u00a068, 69, 76, 77, 109, 112 to 116, 120, 136 and 140 of the Privacy Shield Decision state:\n\u2018(68)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the U.S. Constitution, ensuring national security falls within the President\u2019s authority as Commander in Chief, as Chief Executive and, as regards foreign intelligence, to conduct U.S. foreign affairs\u00a0\u2026 While Congress has the power to impose limitations, and has done so in various respects, within these boundaries the President may direct the activities of the U.S. Intelligence Community, in particular through Executive Orders or Presidential Directives.\u00a0\u2026 At present, the two central legal instruments in this regard are Executive Order 12333 (\u201cE.O.\u00a012333\u201d)\u00a0\u2026 and Presidential Policy Directive 28.\n(69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presidential Policy Directive 28 (\u201cPPD-28\u201d), issued on 17\u00a0January 2014, imposes a number of limitations for \u201csignals intelligence\u201d operations\u00a0\u2026 This presidential directive has binding force for U.S. intelligence authorities\u00a0\u2026 and remains effective upon change in the U.S. Administration\u00a0\u2026 PPD-28 is of particular importance for non-US persons, including EU data subjects.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(76)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although not phrased in\u00a0\u2026 legal terms, [the] principles [of PPD-28] capture the essence of the principles of necessity and proportionality.\u00a0\u2026\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a directive issued by the President as the Chief Executive, these requirements bind the entire Intelligence Community and have been further implemented through agency rules and procedures that transpose the general principles into specific directions for day-to-day operations.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(109)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conversely, under Section\u00a0702 [of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)], the [United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC)] does not authorise individual surveillance measures; rather, it authorises surveillance programs (like PRISM, UPSTREAM) on the basis of annual certifications prepared by the [US] Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence [(DNI)].\u00a0\u2026 As indicated, the certifications to be approved by the FISC contain no information about the individual persons to be targeted but rather identify categories of foreign intelligence information\u00a0\u2026 While the FISC does not assess\u00a0\u2014 under a probable cause or any other standard\u00a0\u2014 that individuals are properly targeted to acquire foreign intelligence information\u00a0\u2026, its control extends to the condition that \u201ca significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information\u201d\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(112)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the [FISA] provides a number of remedies, available also to non-U.S. persons, to challenge unlawful electronic surveillance\u00a0\u2026 This includes the possibility for individuals to bring a civil cause of action for money damages against the United States when information about them has been unlawfully and wilfully used or disclosed\u00a0\u2026; to sue U.S. government officials in their personal capacity (\u201cunder colour of law\u201d) for money damages\u00a0\u2026; and to challenge the legality of surveillance (and seek to suppress the information) in the event the U.S. government intends to use or disclose any information obtained or derived from electronic surveillance against the individual in judicial or administrative proceedings in the United States\u00a0\u2026\n(113)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the U.S. government referred the Commission to a number of additional avenues that EU data subjects could use to seek legal recourse against government officials for unlawful government access to, or use of, personal data, including for purported national security purposes\u00a0\u2026\n(114)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the U.S. government has pointed to the [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)] as a means for non-U.S. persons to seek access to existing federal agency records, including where these contain the individual\u2019s personal data\u00a0\u2026 Given its focus, the FOIA does not provide an avenue for individual recourse against interference with personal data as such, even though it could in principle enable individuals to get access to relevant information held by national intelligence agencies.\u00a0\u2026\n(115)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While individuals, including EU data subjects, therefore have a number of avenues of redress when they have been the subject of unlawful (electronic) surveillance for national security purposes, it is equally clear that at least some legal bases that U.S. intelligence authorities may use (e.g. E.O.\u00a012333) are not covered. Moreover, even where judicial redress possibilities in principle do exist for non-U.S. persons, such as for surveillance under FISA, the available causes of action are limited\u00a0\u2026 and claims brought by individuals (including U.S. persons) will be declared inadmissible where they cannot show \u201cstanding\u201d\u00a0\u2026, which restricts access to ordinary courts\u00a0\u2026\n(116)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to provide for an additional redress avenue accessible for all EU data subjects, the U.S. government has decided to create a new Ombudsperson Mechanism as set out in the letter from the U.S. Secretary of State to the Commission which is contained in Annex\u00a0III to this decision. This mechanism builds on the designation, under PPD-28, of a Senior Coordinator (at the level of Under-Secretary) in the State Department as a contact point for foreign governments to raise concerns regarding U.S. signals intelligence activities, but goes significantly beyond this original concept.\n\u2026\n(120)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 the U.S. government commits to ensure that, in carrying out its functions, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will be able to rely on the cooperation from other oversight and compliance review mechanisms existing in U.S. law.\u00a0\u2026 Where any non-compliance has been found by one of these oversight bodies, the Intelligence Community element (e.g. an intelligence agency) concerned will have to remedy the non-compliance as only this will allow the Ombudsperson to provide a \u201cpositive\u201d response to the individual (i.e. that any non-compliance has been remedied) to which the U.S. government has committed.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(136)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of [those] findings, the Commission considers that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the Union to self-certified organisations in the United States under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.\n\u2026\n(140)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, on the basis of the available information about the U.S. legal order, including the representations and commitments from the U.S. government, the Commission considers that any interference by U.S. public authorities with the fundamental rights of the persons whose data are transferred from the Union to the United States under the Privacy Shield for national security, law enforcement or other public interest purposes, and the ensuing restrictions imposed on self-certified organisations with respect to their adherence to the Principles, will be limited to what is strictly necessary to achieve the legitimate objective in question, and that there exists effective legal protection against such interference.\u2019\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a01 of the Privacy Shield Decision:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of Article\u00a025(2) of [Directive 95/46], the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the Union to organisations in the United States under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is constituted by the Principles issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce on 7\u00a0July 2016 as set out in Annex\u00a0II and the official representations and commitments contained in the documents listed in Annexes\u00a0I [and] III to VII.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of paragraph\u00a01, personal data are transferred under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield where they are transferred from the Union to organisations in the United States that are included in the \u201cPrivacy Shield List\u201d, maintained and made publicly available by the U.S. Department of Commerce, in accordance with Sections\u00a0I and III of the Principles set out in Annex\u00a0II.\u2019\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the heading \u2018EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Principles issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019, Annex\u00a0II to the Privacy Shield Decision, provides, in paragraph\u00a0I.5 thereof, that adherence to those principles may be limited, inter alia, \u2018to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements\u2019.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annex\u00a0III to that decision contains a letter from Mr\u00a0John Kerry, then Secretary of State (United States), to the Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality from 7\u00a0July 2016, to which a memorandum, Annex\u00a0A, was attached, entitled \u2018EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Ombudsperson mechanism regarding signals intelligence\u2019, the latter of which contains the following passage:\n\u2018In recognition of the importance of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, this Memorandum sets forth the process for implementing a new mechanism, consistent with [PPD-28], regarding signals intelligence\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026 President Obama announced the issuance of a new presidential directive\u00a0\u2014 PPD-28\u00a0\u2014 to \u201cclearly prescribe what we do, and do not do, when it comes to our overseas surveillance.\u201d\nSection\u00a04(d) of PPD-28 directs the Secretary of State to designate a \u201cSenior Coordinator for International Information Technology Diplomacy\u201d (Senior Coordinator) \u201cto\u00a0[\u2026] serve as a point of contact for foreign governments who wish to raise concerns regarding signals intelligence activities conducted by the United States.\u201d\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 The Senior Coordinator will serve as the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson and\u00a0\u2026 will work closely with appropriate officials from other departments and agencies who are responsible for processing requests in accordance with applicable United States law and policy. The Ombudsperson is independent from the Intelligence Community. The Ombudsperson reports directly to the Secretary of State who will ensure that the Ombudsperson carries out its function objectively and free from improper influence that is liable to have an effect on the response to be provided.\n\u2026\u2019\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annex\u00a0VI to the Privacy Shield Decision contains a letter from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to the United States Department of Commerce and to the International Trade Administration from 21\u00a0June 2016, in which it is stated that PPD-28 allows for \u2018\u201cbulk\u201d collection\u00a0\u2026 of a relatively large volume of signals intelligence information or data under circumstances where the Intelligence Community cannot use an identifier associated with a specific target\u00a0\u2026 to focus the collection\u2019.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr\u00a0Schrems, an Austrian national residing in Austria, has been a user of the Facebook social network (\u2018Facebook\u2019) since 2008.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any person residing in the European Union who wishes to use Facebook is required to conclude, at the time of his or her registration, a contract with Facebook Ireland, a subsidiary of Facebook Inc. which is itself established in the United States. Some or all of the personal data of Facebook Ireland\u2019s users who reside in the European Union is transferred to servers belonging to Facebook Inc. that are located in the United States, where it undergoes processing.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 25\u00a0June 2013, Mr\u00a0Schrems filed a complaint with the Commissioner whereby he requested, in essence, that Facebook Ireland be prohibited from transferring his personal data to the United States, on the ground that the law and practice in force in that country did not ensure adequate protection of the personal data held in its territory against the surveillance activities in which the public authorities were engaged. That complaint was rejected on the ground, inter alia, that, in Decision 2000/520, the Commission had found that the United States ensured an adequate level of protection.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The High Court (Ireland), before which Mr\u00a0Schrems had brought judicial review proceedings against the rejection of his complaint, made a request to the Court for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation and validity of Decision 2000/520. In a judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n (C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650), the Court declared that decision invalid.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following that judgment, the referring court annulled the rejection of Mr\u00a0Schrems\u2019s complaint and referred that decision back to the Commissioner. In the course of the Commissioner\u2019s investigation, Facebook Ireland explained that a large part of personal data was transferred to Facebook Inc. pursuant to the standard data protection clauses set out in the annex to the SCC Decision. On that basis, the Commissioner asked Mr\u00a0Schrems to reformulate his complaint.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his reformulated complaint lodged on 1\u00a0December 2015, Mr\u00a0Schrems claimed, inter alia, that United States law requires Facebook Inc. to make the personal data transferred to it available to certain United States authorities, such as the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He submitted that, since that data was used in the context of various monitoring programmes in a manner incompatible with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter, the SCC Decision cannot justify the transfer of that data to the United States. In those circumstances, Mr\u00a0Schrems asked the Commissioner to prohibit or suspend the transfer of his personal data to Facebook Inc.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 24\u00a0May 2016, the Commissioner published a \u2018draft decision\u2019 summarising the provisional findings of her investigation. In that draft decision, she took the provisional view that the personal data of EU citizens transferred to the United States were likely to be consulted and processed by the US authorities in a manner incompatible with Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter and that US law did not provide those citizens with legal remedies compatible with Article\u00a047 of the Charter. The Commissioner found that the standard data protection clauses in the annex to the SCC Decision are not capable of remedying that defect, since they confer only contractual rights on data subjects against the data exporter and importer, without, however, binding the United States authorities.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking the view that, in those circumstances, Mr\u00a0Schrems\u2019s reformulated complaint raised the issue of the validity of the SCC Decision, on 31\u00a0May 2016, the Commissioner brought an action before the High Court, relying on the case-law arising from the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n (C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a065), in order for the High Court to refer a question on that issue to the Court. By order of 4\u00a0May 2018, the High Court made the present reference for a preliminary ruling to the Court.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In an annex to the order for reference, the High Court provided a copy of a judgment handed down on 3\u00a0October 2017, in which it had set out the results of an examination of the evidence produced before it in the national proceedings, in which the US Government had participated.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that judgment, to which the request for a preliminary ruling refers on several occasions, the referring court stated that, as a matter of principle, it is not only entitled, but is obliged, to consider all of the facts and arguments presented to it and to decide on the basis of those facts and arguments whether or not a reference is required. The High Court considers that, in any event, it is required to take into account any amendments that may have occurred in the interval between the institution of the proceedings and the hearing which it held. That court stated that, in the main proceedings, its own assessment is not confined to the grounds of invalidity put forward by the Commissioner, as a result of which it may of its own motion decide that there are other well-founded grounds of invalidity and, on those grounds, refer questions for a preliminary ruling.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the findings in that judgment, the US authorities\u2019 intelligence activities concerning the personal data transferred to the United States are based, inter alia, on Section\u00a0702 of the FISA and on E.O.\u00a012333.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its judgment, the referring court specifies that Section\u00a0702 of the FISA permits the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to authorise jointly, following FISC approval, the surveillance of individuals who are not United States citizens located outside the United States in order to obtain \u2018foreign intelligence information\u2019, and provides, inter alia, the basis for the PRISM and UPSTREAM surveillance programmes. In the context of the PRISM programme, Internet service providers are required, according to the findings of that court, to supply the NSA with all communications to and from a \u2018selector\u2019, some of which are also transmitted to the FBI and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the UPSTREAM programme, that court found that, in the context of that programme, telecommunications undertakings operating the \u2018backbone\u2019 of the Internet\u00a0\u2014 that is to say, the network of cables, switches and routers\u00a0\u2014 are required to allow the NSA to copy and filter Internet traffic flows in order to acquire communications from, to or about a non-US national associated with a \u2018selector\u2019. Under that programme, the NSA has, according to the findings of that court, access both to the metadata and to the content of the communications concerned.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court found that E.O.\u00a012333 allows the NSA to access data \u2018in transit\u2019 to the United States, by accessing underwater cables on the floor of the Atlantic, and to collect and retain such data before arriving in the United States and being subject there to the FISA. It adds that activities conducted pursuant to E.O.\u00a012333 are not governed by statute.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the limits on intelligence activities, the referring court emphasises the fact that non-US persons are covered only by PPD-28, which merely states that intelligence activities should be \u2018as tailored as feasible\u2019. On the basis of those findings, the referring court considers that the United States carries out mass processing of personal data without ensuring a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards judicial protection, the referring court states that EU citizens do not have the same remedies as US citizens in respect of the processing of personal data by the US authorities, since the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which constitutes, in United States law, the most important cause of action available to challenge unlawful surveillance, does not apply to EU citizens. In that regard, the referring court states that there are substantial obstacles in respect of the causes of action open to EU citizens, in particular that of \nlocus standi\n, which it considers to be excessively difficult to satisfy. Furthermore, according to the findings of the referring court, the NSA\u2019s activities based on E.O.\u00a012333 are not subject to judicial oversight and are not justiciable. Lastly, the referring court considers that, in so far as, in its view, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson is not a tribunal within the meaning of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, US law does not afford EU citizens a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed by the fundamental right enshrined in that article.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its request for reference preliminary ruling, the referring court also states that the parties to the main proceedings disagree, inter alia, on the applicability of EU law to transfers to a third country of personal data which are likely to be processed by the authorities of that country, inter alia, for purposes of national security and on the factors to be taken into consideration for the purposes of assessing whether that country ensures an adequate level of protection. In particular, that court notes that, according to Facebook Ireland, the Commission\u2019s findings on the adequacy of the level of protection ensured by a third country, such as those set out in the Privacy Shield Decision, are also binding on the supervisory authorities in the context of a transfer of personal data pursuant to the standard data protection clauses in the annex to the SCC Decision.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards those standard data protection clauses, that court asks whether the SCC Decision may be considered to be valid, despite the fact that, according to that court, those clauses are not binding on the State authorities of the third country concerned and, therefore, are not capable of remedying a possible lack of an adequate level of protection in that country. In that regard, it considers that the possibility, afforded to the competent authorities in the Member States by Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Decision 2010/87, in its version prior to the entry into force of Implementing Decision 2016/2297, of prohibiting transfers of personal data to a third country that imposes requirements on the importer that are incompatible with the guarantees contained in those clauses, demonstrates that the state of the law in the third country can justify prohibiting the transfer of data, even when carried out pursuant to the standard data protection clauses in the annex to the SCC Decision, and therefore makes clear that those requirements may be insufficient in ensuring an adequate level of protection. Nonetheless, the referring court harbours doubts as to the extent of the Commissioner\u2019s power to prohibit a transfer of data based on those clauses, despite taking the view that discretion cannot be sufficient to ensure adequate protection.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the High Court decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In circumstances in which personal data is transferred by a private company from a European Union (EU) Member State to a private company in a third country for a commercial purpose pursuant to [the SCC Decision] and may be further processed in the third country by its authorities for purposes of national security but also for purposes of law enforcement and the conduct of the foreign affairs of the third country, does EU law (including the Charter) apply to the transfer of the data notwithstanding the provisions of Article\u00a04(2) TEU in relation to national security and the provisions of the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive [95/46] in relation to public security, defence and State security?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In determining whether there is a violation of the rights of an individual through the transfer of data from the [European Union] to a third country under the [SCC Decision] where it may be further processed for national security purposes, is the relevant comparator for the purposes of [Directive 95/46]:\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Charter, the EU Treaty, the FEU Treaty, [Directive 95/46], the [European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed at Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950] (or any other provision of EU law); or\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the national laws of one or more Member States?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the relevant comparator is (ii), are the practices in the context of national security in one or more Member States also to be included in the

Kingdom Governments claim that the request for a preliminary ruling is inadmissible.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the objection raised by Facebook Ireland, that company observes that the provisions of Directive 95/46, on which the questions referred for a preliminary ruling are based, were repealed by the GDPR.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, although Directive 95/46 was, under Article\u00a094(1) of the GDPR, repealed with effect from 25\u00a0May 2018, that directive was still in force when, on 4\u00a0May 2018, the present request for a preliminary ruling, received at the Court on 9\u00a0May 2018, was made. In addition, the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) and Articles\u00a025, 26 and 28(3) of Directive 95/46 cited in the questions referred, were, in essence, reproduced in Article\u00a02(2) and Articles\u00a045, 46 and 58 of the GDPR, respectively. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the Court has a duty to interpret all provisions of EU law which national courts require in order to decide the actions pending before them, even if those provisions are not expressly indicated in the questions referred to the Court of Justice by those courts (judgment of 2\u00a0April 2020, \nRuska Federacija\n, C-897/19\u00a0PPU, EU:C:2020:262, paragraph\u00a043 and the case-law cited). On those grounds, the fact that the referring court referred its questions by reference solely to the provisions of Directive 95/46 cannot render the present request for a preliminary ruling inadmissible.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For its part, the German Government bases its objection of inadmissibility on the fact, first, that the Commissioner merely expressed doubts, and not a definitive opinion, as to the validity of the SCC Decision and, second, that the referring court failed to ascertain whether Mr\u00a0Schrems had unambiguously given his consent to the transfers of data at issue in the main proceedings, which, if that had been the case, would have the effect of rendering an answer to that question redundant. Lastly, the United Kingdom Government maintains that the questions referred for a preliminary ruling are hypothetical since that court did not find that that data had actually been transferred on the basis of that decision.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from settled case-law of the Court that it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, where the questions referred concern the interpretation or the validity of a rule of EU law, the Court is in principle bound to give a ruling. It follows that questions referred by national courts enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court only where it appears that the interpretation sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its object, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgments of 16\u00a0June 2015, \nGauweiler and Others\n, C-62/14, EU:C:2015:400, paragraphs\u00a024 and 25; of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraph\u00a045; and of 19\u00a0December 2019, \nDobersberger\n, C-16/18, EU:C:2019:1110, paragraphs\u00a018 and 19).\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the request for a preliminary ruling contains sufficient factual and legal material to understand the significance of the questions referred. Furthermore, and most importantly, nothing in the file before the Court leads to the conclusion that the interpretation of EU law that is requested is unrelated to the actual facts of the main action or its object, or that the problem is hypothetical, inter alia, on the basis that the transfer of the personal data at issue in the main proceedings may have been based on the express consent of the data subject of that transfer rather than based on the SCC Decision. As indicated in the request for a preliminary ruling, Facebook Ireland has acknowledged that it transfers the personal data of its subscribers residing in the European Union to Facebook Inc. and that those transfers, the lawfulness of which Mr\u00a0Schrems disputes, were in large part carried out pursuant to the standard data protection clauses in the annex to the SCC Decision.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it is irrelevant to the admissibility of the present request for a preliminary ruling that the Commissioner did not express a definitive opinion on the validity of that decision in so far as the referring court considers that an answer to the questions referred for a preliminary ruling concerning the interpretation and validity of rules of EU law is necessary in order to dispose of the case in the main proceedings.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the request for a preliminary ruling is admissible.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary matter, it must be borne in mind that the present request for a preliminary ruling has arisen following a complaint made by Mr\u00a0Schrems requesting that the Commissioner order the suspension or prohibition, in the future, of the transfer by Facebook Ireland of his personal data to Facebook Inc. Although the questions referred for a preliminary ruling refer to the provisions of Directive 95/46, it is common ground that the Commissioner had not yet adopted a final decision on that complaint when that directive was repealed and replaced by the GDPR with effect from 25\u00a0May 2018.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That absence of a national decision distinguishes the situation at issue in the main proceedings from those which gave rise to the judgments of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGoogle (Territorial scope of de-referencing)\n (C-507/17, EU:C:2019:772), and of 1\u00a0October 2019, \nPlanet49\n (C-673/17, EU:C:2019:801), in which decisions adopted prior to the repeal of that directive were at issue.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The questions referred for a preliminary ruling must therefore be answered in the light of the provisions of the GDPR rather than those of Directive 95/46.\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court wishes to know, in essence, whether Article\u00a02(1) and Article\u00a02(2)(a), (b) and (d) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article\u00a04(2) TEU, must be interpreted as meaning that that regulation applies to the transfer of personal data by an economic operator established in a Member State to another economic operator established in a third country, in circumstances where, at the time of that transfer or thereafter, that data is liable to be processed by the authorities of that third country for the purposes of public security, defence and State security.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be made clear at the outset that the rule in Article\u00a04(2) TEU, according to which, within the European Union, national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State, concerns Member States of the European Union only. That rule is therefore irrelevant, in the present case, for the purposes of interpreting Article\u00a02(1) and Article\u00a02(2)(a), (b) and (d) of the GDPR.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a02(1) of the GDPR, that regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system. Article\u00a04(2) of that regulation defines \u2018processing\u2019 as \u2018any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means\u2019 and mentions, by way of example, \u2018disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available\u2019, but does not distinguish between operations which take place within the European Union and those which are connected with a third country. Furthermore, the GDPR subjects transfers of personal data to third countries to specific rules in Chapter\u00a0V thereof, entitled \u2018Transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations\u2019, and also confers specific powers on the supervisory authorities for that purpose, which are set out in Article\u00a058(2)(j) of that regulation.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the operation of having personal data transferred from a Member State to a third country constitutes, in itself, processing of personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR, carried out in a Member State, and falls within the scope of that regulation under Article\u00a02(1) thereof (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a02(b) and Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a045 and the case-law cited).\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to whether such an operation may be regarded as being excluded from the scope of the GDPR under Article\u00a02(2) thereof, it should be noted that that provision lays down exceptions to the scope of that regulation, as defined in Article\u00a02(1) thereof, which must be interpreted strictly (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a037 and the case-law cited).\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, since the transfer of personal data at issue in the main proceedings is from Facebook Ireland to Facebook Inc., namely between two legal persons, that transfer does not fall within Article\u00a02(2)(c) of the GDPR, which refers to the processing of data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity. Such a transfer also does not fall within the exceptions laid down in Article\u00a02(2)(a), (b) and (d) of that regulation, since the activities mentioned therein by way of example are, in any event, activities of the State or of State authorities and are unrelated to fields in which individuals are active (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a038 and the case-law cited).\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The possibility that the personal data transferred between two economic operators for commercial purposes might undergo, at the time of the transfer or thereafter, processing for the purposes of public security, defence and State security by the authorities of that third country cannot remove that transfer from the scope of the GDPR.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, by expressly requiring the Commission, when assessing the adequacy of the level of protection afforded by a third country, to take account, inter alia, of \u2018relevant legislation, both general and sectoral, including concerning public security, defence, national security and criminal law and the access of public authorities to personal data, as well as the implementation of such legislation\u2019, it is patent from the very wording of Article\u00a045(2)(a) of that regulation that no processing by a third country of personal data for the purposes of public security, defence and State security excludes the transfer at issue from the application of the regulation.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that such a transfer cannot fall outside the scope of the GDPR on the ground that the data at issue is liable to be processed, at the time of that transfer or thereafter, by the authorities of the third country concerned, for the purposes of public security, defence and State security.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a02(1) and (2) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that that regulation applies to the transfer of personal data for commercial purposes by an economic operator established in a Member State to another economic operator established in a third country, irrespective of whether, at the time of that transfer or thereafter, that data is liable to be processed by the authorities of the third country in question for the purposes of public security, defence and State security.\n\u00a0\nThe second, third and sixth questions\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second, third and sixth questions, the referring court seeks clarification from the Court, in essence, on the level of protection required by Article\u00a046(1) and Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR in respect of a transfer of personal data to a third country based on standard data protection clauses. In particular, the referring court asks the Court to specify which factors need to be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining whether that level of protection is ensured in the context of such a transfer.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the level of protection required, it follows from a combined reading of those provisions that, in the absence of an adequacy decision under Article\u00a045(3) of that regulation, a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country only if the controller or processor has provided \u2018appropriate safeguards\u2019, and on condition that \u2018enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects\u2019 are available, such safeguards being able to be provided, inter alia, by the standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Article\u00a046 of the GDPR does not specify the nature of the requirements which flow from that reference to \u2018appropriate safeguards\u2019, \u2018enforceable rights\u2019 and \u2018effective legal remedies\u2019, it should be noted that that article appears in Chapter\u00a0V of that regulation and, accordingly, must be read in the light of Article\u00a044 of that regulation, entitled \u2018General principle for transfers\u2019, which lays down that \u2018all provisions [in that chapter] shall be applied in order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by [that regulation] is not undermined\u2019. That level of protection must therefore be guaranteed irrespective of the provision of that chapter on the basis of which a transfer of personal data to a third country is carried out.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General stated in point\u00a0117 of his Opinion, the provisions of Chapter\u00a0V of the GDPR are intended to ensure the continuity of that high level of protection where personal data is transferred to a third country, in accordance with the objective set out in recital\u00a06 thereof.\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first sentence of Article\u00a045(1) of the GDPR provides that a transfer of personal data to a third country may be authorised by a Commission decision to the effect that that third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, ensures an adequate level of protection. In that regard, although not requiring a third country to ensure a level of protection identical to that guaranteed in the EU legal order, the term \u2018adequate level of protection\u2019 must, as confirmed by recital\u00a0104 of that regulation, be understood as requiring the third country in fact to ensure, by reason of its domestic law or its international commitments, a level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms that is essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the European Union by virtue of the regulation, read in the light of the Charter. If there were no such requirement, the objective referred to in the previous paragraph would be undermined (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a073).\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, recital\u00a0107 of the GDPR states that, where \u2018a third country, a territory or a specified sector within a third country\u00a0\u2026 no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection.\u00a0\u2026 the transfer of personal data to that third country\u00a0\u2026 should be prohibited, unless the requirements [of that regulation] relating to transfers subject to appropriate safeguards\u00a0\u2026 are fulfilled\u2019. To that effect, recital\u00a0108 of the regulation states that, in the absence of an adequacy decision, the appropriate safeguards to be taken by the controller or processor in accordance with Article\u00a046(1) of the regulation must \u2018compensate for the lack of data protection in a third country\u2019 in order to \u2018ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union\u2019.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows, as the Advocate General stated in point\u00a0115 of his Opinion, that such appropriate guarantees must be capable of ensuring that data subjects whose personal data are transferred to a third country pursuant to standard data protection clauses are afforded, as in the context of a transfer based on an adequacy decision, a level of protection essentially equivalent to that which is guaranteed within the European Union.\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court also asks whether the level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the European Union must be determined in the light of EU law, in particular the rights guaranteed by the Charter and/or the fundamental rights enshrined in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u2018the ECHR\u2019), or in the light of the national law of the Member States.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, although, as Article\u00a06(3) TEU confirms, the fundamental rights enshrined in the ECHR constitute general principles of EU law and although Article\u00a052(3) of the Charter provides that the rights contained in the Charter which correspond to rights guaranteed by the ECHR are to have the same meaning and scope as those laid down by that convention, the latter does not constitute, as long as the European Union has not acceded to it, a legal instrument which has been formally incorporated into EU law (judgments of 26\u00a0February 2013, \n\u00c5kerberg Fransson\n, C-617/10, EU:C:2013:105, paragraph\u00a044 and the case-law cited, and of 20\u00a0March 2018, \nMenci\n, C-524/15, EU:C:2018:197, paragraph\u00a022).\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Court has held that the interpretation of EU law and examination of the legality of EU legislation must be undertaken in the light of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter (see, by analogy, judgment of 20\u00a0March 2018, \nMenci\n, C-524/15, EU:C:2018:197, paragraph\u00a024).\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the Court has consistently held that the validity of provisions of EU law and, in the absence of an express reference to the national law of the Member States, their interpretation, cannot be construed in the light of national law, even national law of constitutional status, in particular fundamental rights as formulated in the national constitutions (see, to that effect, judgments of 17\u00a0December 1970, \nInternationale Handelsgesellschaft\n, 11/70, EU:C:1970:114, paragraph\u00a03; of 13\u00a0December 1979, \nHauer\n, 44/79, EU:C:1979:290, paragraph\u00a014; and of 18\u00a0October 2016, \nNikiforidis\n, C-135/15, EU:C:2016:774, paragraph\u00a028 and the case-law cited).\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, since, first, a transfer of personal data, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, for commercial purposes by an economic operator established in one Member State to another economic operator established in a third country, falls, as is apparent from the answer to the first question, within the scope of the GDPR and, second, the purpose of that regulation is, inter alia, as is apparent from recital\u00a010 thereof, to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union and, to that end, to ensure a consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of such natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union, the level of protection of fundamental rights required by Article\u00a046(1) of that regulation must be determined on the basis of the provisions of that regulation, read in the light of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter.\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court also seeks to ascertain what factors should be taken into consideration for the purposes of determining the adequacy of the level of protection where personal data is transferred to a third country pursuant to standard data protection clauses adopted under Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR.\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, although that provision does not list the various factors which must be taken into consideration for the purposes of assessing the adequacy of the level of protection to be observed in such a transfer, Article\u00a046(1) of that regulation states that data subjects must be afforded appropriate safeguards, enforceable rights and effective legal remedies.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The assessment required for that purpose in the context of such a transfer must, in particular, take into consideration both the contractual clauses agreed between the controller or processor established in the European Union and the recipient of the transfer established in the third country concerned and, as regards any access by the public authorities of that third country to the personal data transferred, the relevant aspects of the legal system of that third country. As regards the latter, the factors to be taken into consideration in the context of Article\u00a046 of that regulation correspond to those set out, in a non-exhaustive manner, in Article\u00a045(2) of that regulation.\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the answer to the second, third and sixth questions is that Article\u00a046(1) and Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the appropriate safeguards, enforceable rights and effective legal remedies required by those provisions must ensure that data subjects whose personal data are transferred to a third country pursuant to standard data protection clauses are afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the European Union by that regulation, read in the light of the Charter. To that end, the assessment of the level of protection afforded in the context of such a transfer must, in particular, take into consideration both the contractual clauses agreed between the controller or processor established in the European Union and the recipient of the transfer established in the third country concerned and, as regards any access by the public authorities of that third country to the personal data transferred, the relevant aspects of the legal system of that third country, in particular those set out, in a non-exhaustive manner, in Article\u00a045(2) of that regulation.\n\u00a0\nThe eighth question\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its eighth question, the referring court wishes to know, in essence, whether Article\u00a058(2)(f) and (j) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the competent supervisory authority is required to suspend or prohibit a transfer of personal data to a third country pursuant to standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission, if, in the view of that supervisory authority, those clauses are not or cannot be complied with in that third country and the protection of the data transferred that is required by EU law, in particular by Articles\u00a045 and 46 of the GDPR and by the Charter, cannot be ensured, or as meaning that the exercise of those powers is limited to exceptional cases.\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter and Article\u00a051(1) and Article\u00a057(1)(a) of the GDPR, the national supervisory authorities are responsible for monitoring compliance with the EU rules concerning the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. Each of those authorities is therefore vested with the power to check whether a transfer of personal data from its own Member State to a third country complies with the requirements laid down in that regulation (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a047).\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from those provisions that the supervisory authorities\u2019 primary responsibility is to monitor the application of the GDPR and to ensure its enforcement. The exercise of that responsibility is of particular importance where personal data is transferred to a third country since, as is clear from recital\u00a0116 of that regulation, \u2018when personal data moves across borders outside the Union it may put at increased risk the ability of natural persons to exercise data protection rights in particular to protect themselves from the unlawful use or disclosure of that information\u2019. In such cases, as is stated in that recital, \u2018supervisory authorities may find that they are unable to pursue complaints or conduct investigations relating to the activities outside their borders\u2019.\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, under Article\u00a057(1)(f) of the GDPR, each supervisory authority is required on its territory to handle complaints which, in accordance with Article\u00a077(1) of that regulation, any data subject is entitled to lodge where that data subject considers that the processing of his or her personal data infringes the regulation, and is required to examine the nature of that complaint as necessary. The supervisory authority must handle such a complaint with all due diligence (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a063).\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a078(1) and (2) of the GDPR recognises the right of each person to an effective judicial remedy, in particular, where the supervisory authority fails to deal with his or her complaint. Recital\u00a0141 of that regulation also refers to that \u2018right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance with Article\u00a047 of the Charter\u2019 in circumstances where that supervisory authority \u2018does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject\u2019.\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to handle complaints lodged, Article\u00a058(1) of the GDPR confers extensive investigative powers on each supervisory authority. If a supervisory authority takes the view, following an investigation, that a data subject whose personal data have been transferred to a third country is not afforded an adequate level of protection in that country, it is required, under EU law, to take appropriate action in order to remedy any findings of inadequacy, irrespective of the reason for, or nature of, that inadequacy. To that effect, Article\u00a058(2) of that regulation lists the various corrective powers which the supervisory authority may adopt.\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the supervisory authority must determine which action is appropriate and necessary and take into consideration all the circumstances of the transfer of personal data in question in that determination, the supervisory authority is nevertheless required to execute its responsibility for ensuring that the GDPR is fully enforced with all due diligence.\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as the Advocate General also stated in point\u00a0148 of his Opinion, the supervisory authority is required, under Article\u00a058(2)(f) and (j) of that regulation, to suspend or prohibit a transfer of personal data to a third country if, in its view, in the light of all the circumstances of that transfer, the standard data protection clauses are not or cannot be complied with in that third country and the protection of the data transferred that is required by EU law cannot be ensured by other means, where the controller or a processor has not itself suspended or put an end to the transfer.\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The interpretation in the previous paragraph is not undermined by the Commissioner\u2019s reasoning that Article\u00a04 of Decision 2010/87, in its version prior to the entry into force of Implementing Decision 2016/2297, read in the light of recital\u00a011 of that decision, confined the power of supervisory authorities to suspend or prohibit a transfer of personal data to a third country to certain exceptional circumstances. As amended by Implementing Decision 2016/2297, Article\u00a04 of the SCC Decision refers to the power of the supervisory authorities, now under Article\u00a058(2)(f) and (j) of the GDPR, to suspend or ban such a transfer, without confining the exercise of that power to exceptional circumstances.\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, the implementing power which Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR grants to the Commission for the purposes of adopting standard data protection clauses does not confer upon it competence to restrict the national supervisory authorities\u2019 powers on the basis of Article\u00a058(2) of that regulation (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a025(6) and Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraphs\u00a0102 and 103). Moreover, as stated in recital\u00a05 of Implementing Decision 2016/2297, the SCC Decision \u2018does not prevent a [supervisory authority] from exercising its powers to oversee data flows, including the power to suspend or ban a transfer of personal data when it determines that the transfer is carried out in violation of EU or national data protection law\u2019.\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should, however, be pointed out that the powers of the competent supervisory authority are subject to full compliance with the decision in which the Commission finds, where relevant, under the first sentence of Article\u00a045(1) of the GDPR, that a particular third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In such a case, it is clear from the second sentence of Article\u00a045(1) of that regulation, read in conjunction with recital\u00a0103 thereof, that transfers of personal data to the third country in question may take place without requiring any specific authorisation.\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the fourth paragraph of Article\u00a0288 TFEU, a Commission adequacy decision is, in its entirety, binding on all the Member States to which it is addressed and is therefore binding on all their organs in so far as it finds that the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and has the effect of authorising such transfers of personal data (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a051 and the case-law cited).\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, until such time as a Commission adequacy decision is declared invalid by the Court, the Member States and their organs, which include their independent supervisory authorities, cannot adopt measures contrary to that decision, such as acts intended to determine with binding effect that the third country covered by it does not ensure an adequate level of protection (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a052 and the case-law cited) and, as a result, to suspend or prohibit transfers of personal data to that third country.\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, a Commission adequacy decision adopted pursuant to Article\u00a045(3) of the GDPR cannot prevent persons whose personal data has been or could be transferred to a third country from lodging a complaint, within the meaning of Article\u00a077(1) of the GDPR, with the competent national supervisory authority concerning the protection of their rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of that data. Similarly, a decision of that nature cannot eliminate or reduce the powers expressly accorded to the national supervisory authorities by Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter and Article\u00a051(1) and Article\u00a057(1)(a) of the GDPR (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a025(6) and Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a053).\n120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, even if the Commission has adopted a Commission adequacy decision, the competent national supervisory authority, when a complaint is lodged by a person concerning the protection of his or her rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, must be able to examine, with complete independence, whether the transfer of that data complies with the requirements laid down by the GDPR and, where relevant, to bring an action before the national courts in order for them, if they share the doubts of that supervisory authority as to the validity of the Commission adequacy decision, to make a reference for a preliminary ruling for the purpose of examining its validity (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a025(6) and Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraphs\u00a057 and 65).\n121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the eighth question is that Article\u00a058(2)(f) and (j) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, unless there is a valid Commission adequacy decision, the competent supervisory authority is required to suspend or prohibit a transfer of data to a third country pursuant to standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission, if, in the view of that supervisory authority and in the light of all the circumstances of that transfer, those clauses are not or cannot be complied with in that third country and the protection of the data transferred that is required by EU law, in particular by Articles\u00a045 and 46 of the GDPR and by the Charter, cannot be ensured by other means, where the controller or a processor has not itself suspended or put an end to the transfer.\n\u00a0\nThe\n7th and 11th\n questions\n122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its 7th and 11th questions, which it is appropriate to consider together, the referring court seeks clarification from the Court, in essence, on the validity of the SCC Decision in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter.\n123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, as is clear from the wording of the seventh question and the corresponding explanations in the request for a preliminary ruling, the referring court asks whether the SCC Decision is capable of ensuring an adequate level of protection of the personal data transferred to third countries given that the standard data protection clauses provided for in that decision do not bind the supervisory authorities of those third countries.\n124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01 of the SCC Decision provides that the standard data protection clauses set out in its annex are considered to offer adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of the privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals in accordance with the requirements of Article\u00a026(2) of Directive 95/46. The latter provision was, in essence, reproduced in Article\u00a046(1) and Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR.\n125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, although those clauses are binding on a controller established in the European Union and the recipient of the transfer of personal data established in a third country where they have concluded a contract incorporating those clauses, it is common ground that those clauses are not capable of binding the authorities of that third country, since they are not party to the contract.\n126\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, although there are situations in which, depending on the law and practices in force in the third country concerned, the recipient of such a transfer is in a position to guarantee the necessary protection of the data solely on the basis of standard data protection clauses, there are others in which the content of those standard clauses might not constitute a sufficient means of ensuring, in practice, the effective protection of personal data transferred to the third country concerned. That is the case, in particular, where the law of that third country allows its public authorities to interfere with the rights of the data subjects to which that data relates.\n127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the question arises whether a Commission decision concerning standard data protection clauses, adopted pursuant to Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR, is invalid in the absence, in that decision, of guarantees which can be enforced against the public authorities of the third countries to which personal data is or could be transferred pursuant to those clauses.\n128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a046(1) of the GDPR provides that, in the absence of an adequacy decision, a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country only if the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. According to Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR, those safeguards may be provided by standard data protection clauses drawn up by the Commission. However, those provisions do not state that all safeguards must necessarily be provided for in a Commission decision such as the SCC Decision.\n129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted in that regard that such a standard clauses decision differs from an adequacy decision adopted pursuant to Article\u00a045(3) of the GDPR, which seeks, following an examination of the legislation of the third country concerned taking into account, inter alia, the relevant legislation on national security and public authorities\u2019 access to personal data, to find with binding effect that a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country ensures an adequate level of protection and that the access of that third country\u2019s public authorities to such data does not therefore impede transfers of such personal data to the third country. Such an adequacy decision can therefore be adopted by the Commission only if it has found that the third country\u2019s relevant legislation in that field does in fact provide all the necessary guarantees from which it can be concluded that that legislation ensures an adequate level of protection.\n130\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, in the case of a Commission decision adopting standard data protection clauses, such as the SCC Decision, in so far as such a decision does not refer to a third country, a territory or one or more specific sectors in a third country, it cannot be inferred from Article\u00a046(1) and Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR that the Commission is required, before adopting such a decision, to assess the adequacy of the level of protection ensured by the third countries to which personal data could be transferred pursuant to such clauses.\n131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, according to Article\u00a046(1) of the GDPR, in the absence of a Commission adequacy decision, it is for the controller or processor established in the European Union to provide, inter alia, appropriate safeguards. Recitals\u00a0108 and 114 of the GDPR confirm that, where the Commission has not adopted a decision on the adequacy of the level of data protection in a third country, the controller or, where relevant, the processor \u2018should take measures to compensate for the lack of data protection in a third country by way of appropriate safeguards for the data subject\u2019 and that \u2018those safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union, including the availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies\u00a0\u2026 in the Union or in a third country\u2019.\n132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since by their inherently contractual nature standard data protection clauses cannot bind the public authorities of third countries, as is clear from paragraph\u00a0125 above, but that Article\u00a044, Article\u00a046(1) and Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR, interpreted in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter, require that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by that regulation is not undermined, it may prove necessary to supplement the guarantees contained in those standard data protection clauses. In that regard, recital\u00a0109 of the regulation states that \u2018the possibility for the controller\u00a0\u2026 to use standard data-protection clauses adopted by the Commission\u00a0\u2026 should [not] prevent [it]\u00a0\u2026 from adding other clauses or additional safeguards\u2019 and states, in particular, that the controller \u2018should be encouraged to provide additional safeguards\u00a0\u2026 that supplement standard [data] protection clauses\u2019.\n133\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR are solely intended to provide contractual guarantees that apply uniformly in all third countries to controllers and processors established in the European Union and, consequently, independently of the level of protection guaranteed in each third country. In so far as those standard data protection clauses cannot, having regard to their very nature, provide guarantees beyond a contractual obligation to ensure compliance with the level of protection required under EU law, they may require, depending on the prevailing position in a particular third country, the adoption of supplementary measures by the controller in order to ensure compliance with that level of protection.\n134\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as the Advocate General stated in point\u00a0126 of his Opinion, the contractual mechanism provided for in Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR is based on the responsibility of the controller or his or her subcontractor established in the European Union and, in the alternative, of the competent supervisory authority. It is therefore, above all, for that controller or processor to verify, on a case-by-case basis and, where appropriate, in collaboration with the recipient of the data, whether the law of the third country of destination ensures adequate protection, under EU law, of personal data transferred pursuant to standard data protection clauses, by providing, where necessary, additional safeguards to those offered by those clauses.\n135\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the controller or a processor established in the European Union is not able to take adequate additional measures to guarantee such protection, the controller or processor or, failing that, the competent supervisory authority, are required to suspend or end the transfer of personal data to the third country concerned. That is the case, in particular, where the law of that third country imposes on the recipient of personal data from the European Union obligations which are contrary to those clauses and are, therefore, capable of impinging on the contractual guarantee of an adequate level of protection against access by the public authorities of that third country to that data.\n136\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the mere fact that standard data protection clauses in a Commission decision adopted pursuant to Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR, such as those in the annex to the SCC Decision, do not bind the authorities of third countries to which personal data may be transferred cannot affect the validity of that decision.\n137\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That validity depends, however, on whether, in accordance with the requirement of Article\u00a046(1) and Article\u00a046(2)(c) of the GDPR, interpreted in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter, such a standard clauses decision incorporates effective mechanisms that make it possible, in practice, to ensure compliance with the level of protection required by EU law and that transfers of personal data pursuant to the clauses of such a decision are suspended or prohibited in the event of the breach of such clauses or it being impossible to honour them.\n138\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the guarantees contained in the standard data protection clauses in the annex to the SCC Decision, it is clear from Clause\u00a04(a) and (b), Clause\u00a05(a), Clause\u00a09 and Clause\u00a011(1) thereof that a data controller established in the European Union, the recipient of the personal data and any processor thereof mutually undertake to ensure that the processing of that data, including the transfer thereof, has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with \u2018the applicable data protection law\u2019, namely, according to the definition set out in Article\u00a03(f) of that decision, \u2018the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established\u2019. The provisions of the GDPR, read in the light of the Charter, form part of that legislation.\n139\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, a recipient of personal data established in a third country undertakes, pursuant to Clause\u00a05(a), to inform the controller established in the European Union promptly of any inability to comply with its obligations under the contract concluded. In particular, according to Clause\u00a05(b), the recipient certifies that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling its obligations under the contract entered into and undertakes to notify the data controller about any change in the national legislation applicable to it which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the standard data protection clauses in the annex to the SCC Decision, promptly upon notice thereof. Furthermore, although Clause\u00a05(d)(i) allows a recipient of personal data not to notify a controller established in the European Union of a legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority, in the event of legislation prohibiting that recipient from doing so, such as a prohibition under criminal law the aim of which is to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation, the recipient is nevertheless required, pursuant to Clause\u00a05(a) in the annex to the SCC Decision, to inform the controller of his or her inability to comply with the standard data protection clauses.\n140\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clause\u00a05(a) and (b), in both cases to which it refers, confers on the controller established in the European Union the right to suspend the transfer of data and/or to terminate the contract. In the light of the requirements of Article\u00a046(1) and (2)(c) of the GDPR, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, the controller is bound to suspend the transfer of data and/or to terminate the contract where the recipient is not, or is no longer, able to comply with the standard data protection clauses. Unless the controller does so, it will be in breach of its obligations under Clause\u00a04(a) in the annex to the SCC Decision as interpreted in the light of the GDPR and of the Charter.\n141\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that Clause\u00a04(a) and Clause\u00a05(a) and (b) in that annex oblige the controller established in the European Union and the recipient of personal data to satisfy themselves that the legislation of the third country of destination enables the recipient to comply with the standard data protection clauses in the annex to the SCC Decision, before transferring personal data to that third country. As regards that verification, the footnote to Clause\u00a05 states that mandatory requirements of that legislation which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society to safeguard, inter alia, national security, defence and public security are not in contradiction with those standard data protection clauses. Conversely, as stated by the Advocate General in point\u00a0131 of his Opinion, compliance with an obligation prescribed by the law of the third country of destination which goes beyond what is necessary for those purposes must be treated as a breach of those clauses. Operators\u2019 assessments of the necessity of such an obligation must, where relevant, take into account a finding that the level of protection ensured by the third country in a Commission adequacy decision, adopted under Article\u00a045(3) of the GDPR, is appropriate.\n142\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that a controller established in the European Union and the recipient of personal data are required to verify, prior to any transfer, whether the level of protection required by EU law is respected in the third country concerned. The recipient is, where appropriate, under an obligation, under Clause\u00a05(b), to inform the controller of any inability to comply with those clauses, the latter then being, in turn, obliged to suspend the transfer of data and/or to terminate the contract.\n143\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the recipient of personal data to a third country has notified the controller, pursuant to Clause\u00a05(b) in the annex to the SCC Decision, that the legislation of the third country concerned does not allow him or her to comply with the standard data protection clauses in that annex, it follows from Clause\u00a012 in that annex that data that has already been transferred to that third country and the copies thereof must be returned or destroyed in their entirety. In any event, under Clause\u00a06 in that annex, breach of those standard clauses will result in a right for the person concerned to receive compensation for the damage suffered.\n144\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be added that, under Clause\u00a04(f) in the annex to the SCC Decision, a controller established in the European Union undertakes, where special categories of data could be transferred to a third country not providing adequate protection, to inform the data subject before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer. That notice enables the data subject to be in a position to bring legal action against the controller pursuant to Clause\u00a03(1) in that annex so that the controller suspends the proposed transfer, terminates the contract concluded with the recipient of the personal data or, where appropriate, requires the recipient to return or destroy the data transferred.\n145\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, under Clause\u00a04(g) in that annex, the controller established in the European Union is required, when the recipient of personal data notifies him or her, pursuant to Clause\u00a05(b), in the event of a change in the relevant legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the standard data protection clauses, to forward any notification to the competent supervisory authority if the controller established in the European Union decides, notwithstanding that notification, to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension. The forwarding of such a notification to that supervisory authority and its right to conduct an audit of the recipient of personal data pursuant to Clause\u00a08(2) in that annex enable that supervisory authority to ascertain whether the proposed transfer should be suspended or prohibited in order to ensure an adequate level of protection.\n146\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, Article\u00a04 of the SCC Decision, read in the light of recital\u00a05 of Implementing Decision 2016/2297, supports the view that the SCC Decision does not prevent the competent supervisory authority from suspending or prohibiting, as appropriate, a transfer of personal data to a third country pursuant to the standard data protection clauses in the annex to that decision. In that regard, as is apparent from the answer to the eighth question, unless there is a valid Commission adequacy decision, the competent supervisory authority is required, under Article\u00a058(2)(f) and (j) of the GDPR, to suspend or prohibit such a transfer, if, in its view and in the light of all the circumstances of that transfer, those clauses are not or cannot be complied with in that third country and the protection of the data transferred that is required by EU law cannot be ensured by other means, where the controller or a processor has not itself suspended or put an end to the transfer.\n147\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the fact, underlined by the Commissioner, that transfers of personal data to such a third country may result in the supervisory authorities in the various Member States adopting divergent decisions, it should be added that, as is clear from Article\u00a055(1) and Article\u00a057(1)(a) of the GDPR, the task of enforcing that regulation is conferred, in principle, on each supervisory authority on the territory of its own Member State. Furthermore, in order to avoid divergent decisions, Article\u00a064(2) of the GDPR provides for the possibility for a supervisory authority which considers that transfers of data to a third country must, in general, be prohibited, to refer the matter to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) for an opinion, which may, under Article\u00a065(1)(c) of the GDPR, adopt a binding decision, in particular where a supervisory authority does not follow the opinion issued.\n148\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the SCC Decision provides for effective mechanisms which, in practice, ensure that the transfer to a third country of personal data pursuant to the standard data protection clauses in the annex to that decision is suspended or prohibited where the recipient of the transfer does not comply with those clauses or is unable to comply with them.\n149\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the 7th and 11th questions is that examination of the SCC Decision in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter has disclosed nothing to affect the validity of that decision.\n\u00a0\nThe\n\u00a0\n4th, 5th, 9th and 10th\n questions\n150\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its ninth question, the referring court wishes to know, in essence, whether and to what extent findings in the Privacy Shield Decision to the effect that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection are binding on the supervisory authority of a Member State. By its 4th, 5th and 10th questions, that court asks, in essence, whether, in view of its own findings on US law, the transfer to that third country of personal data pursuant to the standard data protection clauses in the annex to the SCC Decision breaches the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter and asks the Court, in particular, whether the introduction of the ombudsperson referred to in Annex\u00a0III to the Privacy Shield Decision is compatible with Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n151\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary matter, it should be noted that, although the Commissioner\u2019s action in the main proceedings only calls into question the SCC Decision, that action was brought before the referring court prior to the adoption of the Privacy Shield Decision. In so far as, by its fourth and fifth questions, that court asks the Court, at a general level, what protection must be ensured, under Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter, in the context of such a transfer, the Court\u2019s analysis must take into consideration the consequences arising from the subsequent adoption of the Privacy Shield Decision. A fortiori that is the case in so far as the referring court asks expressly, by its 10th question, whether the protection required by Article\u00a047 of the Charter is ensured by the offices of the ombudsperson to which the Privacy Shield Decision refers.\n152\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it is clear from the information provided in the order for reference that, in the main proceedings, Facebook Ireland claims that the Privacy Shield Decision is binding on the Commissioner in respect of the finding on the adequacy of the level of protection ensured by the United States and therefore in respect of the lawfulness of a transfer to that third country of personal data pursuant to the standard data protection clauses in the annex to the SCC Decision.\n153\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As appears from paragraph\u00a059 above, in its judgment of 3\u00a0October 2017, provided in an annex to the order for reference, the referring court stated that it was obliged to take account of amendments to the law that may have occurred in the interval between the institution of the proceedings and the hearing of the action before it. Thus, that court would appear to be obliged to take into account, in order to dispose of the case in the main proceedings, the change in circumstances brought about by the adoption of the Privacy Shield Decision and any binding force it may have.\n154\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the question whether the finding in the Privacy Shield Decision that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection is binding is relevant for the purposes of assessing both the obligations, set out in paragraphs\u00a0141 and 142 above, of the controller and recipient of personal data transferred to a third country pursuant to the standard data protection clauses in the annex to the SCC Decision and also any obligations to which the supervisory authority may be subject to suspend or prohibit such a transfer.\n155\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to whether the Privacy Shield Decision has binding effects, Article\u00a01(1) of that decision provides that, for the purposes of Article\u00a045(1) of the GDPR, \u2018the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the [European] Union to organisations in the United States under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield\u2019. In accordance with Article\u00a01(3) of the decision, personal data are regarded as transferred under the EU-US Privacy Shield where they are transferred from the Union to organisations in the United States that are included in the \u2018Privacy Shield List\u2019, maintained and made publicly available by the US Department of Commerce, in accordance with Sections\u00a0I and III of the Principles set out in Annex\u00a0II to that decision.\n156\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As follows from the case-law set out in paragraphs\u00a0117 and 118 above, the Privacy Shield Decision is binding on the supervisory authorities in so far as it finds that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection and, therefore, has the effect of authorising personal data transferred under the EU-US Privacy Shield. Therefore, until the Court should declare that decision invalid, the competent supervisory authority cannot suspend or prohibit a transfer of personal data to an organisation that abides by that privacy shield on the ground that it considers, contrary to the finding made by the Commission in that decision, that the US legislation governing the access to personal data transferred under that privacy shield and the use of that data by the public authorities of that third country for national security, law enforcement and other public interest purposes does not ensure an adequate level of protection.\n157\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact remains that, in accordance with the case-law set out in paragraphs\u00a0119 and 120 above, when a person lodges a complaint with the competent supervisory authority, that authority must examine, with complete independence, whether the transfer of personal data at issue complies with the requirements laid down by the GDPR and, if, in its view, the arguments put forward by that person with a view to challenging the validity of an adequacy decision are well founded, bring an action before the national courts in order for them to make a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling for the purpose of examining the validity of that decision.\n158\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A complaint lodged under Article\u00a077(1) of the GDPR, by which a person whose personal data has been or could be transferred to a third country contends that, notwithstanding what the Commission has found in a decision adopted pursuant to Article\u00a045(3) of the GDPR, the law and practices of that country do not ensure an adequate level of protection must be understood as concerning, in essence, the issue of whether that decision is compatible with the protection of the privacy and of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a025(6) and Article\u00a028(4) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a059).\n159\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, in essence, Mr\u00a0Schrems requested the Commissioner to prohibit or suspend the transfer by Facebook Ireland of his personal data to Facebook Inc., established in the United States, on the ground that that third country did not ensure an adequate level of protection. Following an investigation into Mr\u00a0Schrems\u2019s claims, the Commissioner brought the matter before the referring court and that court appears, in the light of the evidence adduced and of the competing arguments put by the parties before it, to be unsure whether Mr\u00a0Schrems\u2019s doubts as to the adequacy of the level of protection ensured in that third country are well founded, despite the subsequent findings of the Commission in the Privacy Shield Decision, and that has led that court to refer the 4th, 5th and 10th questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling.\n160\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a0175 of his Opinion, those questions must therefore be regarded, in essence, as calling into question the Commission\u2019s finding, in the Privacy Shield Decision, that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection of personal data transferred from the European Union to that third country, and, therefore, as calling into question the validity of that decision.\n161\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the considerations set out in paragraphs\u00a0121 and 157 to 160 above and in order to give the referring court a full answer, it should therefore be examined whether the Privacy Shield Decision complies with the requirements stemming from the GDPR read in the light of the Charter (see, by analogy, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a067).\n162\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order for the Commission to adopt an adequacy decision pursuant to Article\u00a045(3) of the GDPR, it must find, duly stating reasons, that the third country concerned in fact ensures, by reason of its domestic law or its international commitments, a level of protection of fundamental rights essentially equivalent to that guaranteed in the EU legal order (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a025(6) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a096).\n\u00a0\nThe Privacy Shield Decision\n163\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission found, in Article\u00a01(1) of the Privacy Shield Decision, that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the Union to organisations in the United States under the EU-US Privacy Shield, the latter being comprised, inter alia, under Article\u00a01(2) of that decision, of the Principles issued by the US Department of Commerce on 7\u00a0July 2016 as set out in Annex\u00a0II to the decision and the official representations and commitments contained in the documents listed in Annexes\u00a0I and III to VII to that decision.\n164\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the Privacy Shield Decision also states, in paragraph\u00a0I.5. of Annex\u00a0II, under the heading \u2018EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Principles\u2019, that adherence to those principles may be limited, inter alia, \u2018to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements\u2019. Thus, that decision lays down, as did Decision 2000/520, that those requirements have primacy over those principles, primacy pursuant to which self-certified United States organisations receiving personal data from the European Union are bound to disregard the principles without limitation where they conflict with the requirements and therefore prove incompatible with them (see, by analogy, as regards Decision 2000/520, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a086).\n165\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of its general nature, the derogation set out in paragraph\u00a0I.5 of Annex\u00a0II to the Privacy Shield Decision thus enables interference, based on national security and public interest requirements or on domestic legislation of the United States, with the fundamental rights of the persons whose personal data is or could be transferred from the European Union to the United States (see, by analogy, as regards Decision 2000/520, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a087). More particularly, as noted in the Privacy Shield Decision, such interference can arise from access to, and use of, personal data transferred from the European Union to the United States by US public authorities through the PRISM and UPSTREAM surveillance programmes under Section\u00a0702 of the FISA and E.O.\u00a012333.\n166\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, in recitals\u00a067 to 135 of the Privacy Shield Decision, the Commission assessed the limitations and safeguards available in US law, inter alia under Section\u00a0702 of the FISA, E.O.\u00a012333 and PPD-28, as regards access to, and use of, personal data transferred under the EU-US Privacy Shield by US public authorities for national security, law enforcement and other public interest purposes.\n167\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following that assessment, the Commission found, in recital\u00a0136 of that decision, that \u2018the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the [European] Union to self-certified organisations in the United States\u2019, and, in recital\u00a0140 of the decision, it considered that, \u2018on the basis of the available information about the U.S. legal order,\u00a0\u2026 any interference by U.S. public authorities with the fundamental rights of the persons whose data are transferred from the [European] Union to the United States under the Privacy Shield for national security, law enforcement or other public interest purposes, and the ensuing restrictions imposed on self-certified organisations with respect to their adherence to the Principles, will be limited to what is strictly necessary to achieve the legitimate objective in question, and that there exists effective legal protection against such interference\u2019.\n\u00a0\nThe finding of an adequate level of protection\n168\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the factors mentioned by the Commission in the Privacy Shield Decision and the referring court\u2019s findings in the main proceedings, the referring court harbours doubts as to whether US law in fact ensures the adequate level of protection required under Article\u00a045 of the GDPR, read in the light of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter. In particular, that court considers that the law of that third country does not provide for the necessary limitations and safeguards with regard to the interferences authorised by its national legislation and does not ensure effective judicial protection against such interferences. As far as concerns effective judicial protection, it adds that the introduction of a Privacy Shield Ombudsperson cannot, in its view, remedy those deficiencies since an ombudsperson cannot be regarded as a tribunal within the meaning of Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n169\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the first place, Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, which contribute to the level of protection required within the European Union, compliance with which must be established by the Commission before it adopts an adequacy decision under Article\u00a045(1) of the GDPR, it must be borne in mind that Article\u00a07 of the Charter states that everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications. Article\u00a08(1) of the Charter expressly confers on everyone the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\n170\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, access to a natural person\u2019s personal data with a view to its retention or use affects the fundamental right to respect for private life guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, which concerns any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. Such processing of data also falls within the scope of Article\u00a08 of the Charter because it constitutes the processing of personal data within the meaning of that article and, accordingly, must necessarily satisfy the data protection requirements laid down in that article (see, to that effect, judgments of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraphs\u00a049 and 52, and of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a029; and Opinion 1/15 (EU-Canada PNR Agreement) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0122 and 123).\n171\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has held that the communication of personal data to a third party, such as a public authority, constitutes an interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, whatever the subsequent use of the information communicated. The same is true of the retention of personal data and access to that data with a view to its use by public authorities, irrespective of whether the information in question relating to private life is sensitive or whether the persons concerned have been inconvenienced in any way on account of that interference (see, to that effect, judgments of 20\u00a0May 2003, \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01, EU:C:2003:294, paragraphs\u00a074 and 75, and of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraphs\u00a033 to 36; and Opinion 1/15 (EU-Canada PNR Agreement) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0124 and 126).\n172\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society (see, to that effect, judgments of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraph\u00a048 and the case-law cited, and of 17\u00a0October 2013, \nSchwarz\n, C-291/12, EU:C:2013:670, paragraph\u00a033 and the case-law cited; and Opinion 1/15 (EU-Canada PNR Agreement) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0136).\n173\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this connection, it should also be observed that, under Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter, personal data must, inter alia, be processed \u2018for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law\u2019.\n174\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in accordance with the first sentence of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by the Charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. Under the second sentence of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made to those rights and freedoms only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.\n175\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following from the previous point, it should be added that the requirement that any limitation on the exercise of fundamental rights must be provided for by law implies that the legal basis which permits the interference with those rights must itself define the scope of the limitation on the exercise of the right concerned (Opinion 1/15 (EU-Canada PNR Agreement) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0139 and the case-law cited).\n176\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, in order to satisfy the requirement of proportionality according to which derogations from and limitations on the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary, the legislation in question which entails the interference must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose data has been transferred have sufficient guarantees to protect effectively their personal data against the risk of abuse. It must, in particular, indicate in what circumstances and under which conditions a measure providing for the processing of such data may be adopted, thereby ensuring that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subject to automated processing (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 (EU-Canada PNR Agreement) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0140 and 141 and the case-law cited).\n177\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that effect, Article\u00a045(2)(a) of the GDPR states that, in its assessment of the adequacy of the level of protection in a third country, the Commission is, in particular, to take account of \u2018effective and enforceable data subject rights\u2019 for data subjects whose personal data are transferred.\n178\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the Commission\u2019s finding in the Privacy Shield Decision that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data essentially equivalent to that guaranteed in the European Union by the GDPR, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, has been called into question, inter alia, on the ground that the interference arising from the surveillance programmes based on Section\u00a0702 of the FISA and on E.O.\u00a012333 are not covered by requirements ensuring, subject to the principle of proportionality, a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed by the second sentence of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter. It is therefore necessary to examine whether the implementation of those surveillance programmes is subject to such requirements, and it is not necessary to ascertain beforehand whether that third country has complied with conditions essentially equivalent to those laid down in the first sentence of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter.\n179\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as regards the surveillance programmes based on Section\u00a0702 of the FISA, the Commission found, in recital\u00a0109 of the Privacy Shield Decision, that, according to that article, \u2018the FISC does not authorise individual surveillance measures; rather, it authorises surveillance programs (like PRISM, UPSTREAM) on the basis of annual certifications prepared by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI)\u2019. As is clear from that recital, the supervisory role of the FISC is thus designed to verify whether those surveillance programmes relate to the objective of acquiring foreign intelligence information, but it does not cover the issue of whether \u2018individuals are properly targeted to acquire foreign intelligence information\u2019.\n180\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is thus apparent that Section\u00a0702 of the FISA does not indicate any limitations on the power it confers to implement surveillance programmes for the purposes of foreign intelligence or the existence of guarantees for non-US persons potentially targeted by those programmes. In those circumstances and as the Advocate General stated, in essence, in points\u00a0291, 292 and 297 of his Opinion, that article cannot ensure a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed by the Charter, as interpreted by the case-law set out in paragraphs\u00a0175 and 176 above, according to which a legal basis which permits interference with fundamental rights must, in order to satisfy the requirements of the principle of proportionality, itself define the scope of the limitation on the exercise of the right concerned and lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and imposing minimum safeguards.\n181\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the findings in the Privacy Shield Decision, the implementation of the surveillance programmes based on Section\u00a0702 of the FISA is, indeed, subject to the requirements of PPD-28. However, although the Commission stated, in recitals\u00a069 and 77 of the Privacy Shield Decision, that such requirements are binding on the US intelligence authorities, the US Government has accepted, in reply to a question put by the Court, that PPD-28 does not grant data subjects actionable rights before the courts against the US authorities. Therefore, the Privacy Shield Decision cannot ensure a level of protection essentially equivalent to that arising from the Charter, contrary to the requirement in Article\u00a045(2)(a) of the GDPR that a finding of equivalence depends, inter alia, on whether data subjects whose personal data are being transferred to the third country in question have effective and enforceable rights.\n182\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the monitoring programmes based on E.O.\u00a012333, it is clear from the file before the Court that that order does not confer rights which are enforceable against the US authorities in the courts either.\n183\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be added that PPD-28, with which the application of the programmes referred to in the previous two paragraphs must comply, allows for \u2018\u201cbulk\u201d collection\u00a0\u2026 of a relatively large volume of signals intelligence information or data under circumstances where the Intelligence Community cannot use an identifier associated with a specific target\u00a0\u2026 to focus the collection\u2019, as stated in a letter from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to the United States Department of Commerce and to the International Trade Administration from 21\u00a0June 2016, set out in Annex\u00a0VI to the Privacy Shield Decision. That possibility, which allows, in the context of the surveillance programmes based on E.O.\u00a012333, access to data in transit to the United States without that access being subject to any judicial review, does not, in any event, delimit in a sufficiently clear and precise manner the scope of such bulk collection of personal data.\n184\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows therefore that neither Section\u00a0702 of the FISA, nor E.O.\u00a012333, read in conjunction with PPD-28, correlates to the minimum safeguards resulting, under EU law, from the principle of proportionality, with the consequence that the surveillance programmes based on those provisions cannot be regarded as limited to what is strictly necessary.\n185\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the limitations on the protection of personal data arising from the domestic law of the United States on the access and use by US public authorities of such data transferred from the European Union to the United States, which the Commission assessed in the Privacy Shield Decision, are not circumscribed in a way that satisfies requirements that are essentially equivalent to those required, under EU law, by the second sentence of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter.\n186\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards Article\u00a047 of the Charter, which also contributes to the required level of protection in the European Union, compliance with which must be determined by the Commission before it adopts an adequacy decision pursuant to Article\u00a045(1) of the GDPR, it should be noted that the first paragraph of Article\u00a047 requires everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are violated to have the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal in compliance with the conditions laid down in that article. According to the second paragraph of that article, everyone is entitled to a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.\n187\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to settled case-law, the very existence of effective judicial review designed to ensure compliance with provisions of EU law is inherent in the existence of the rule of law. Thus, legislation not providing for any possibility for an individual to pursue legal remedies in order to have access to personal data relating to him or her, or to obtain the rectification or erasure of such data, does not respect the essence of the fundamental right to effective judicial protection, as enshrined in Article\u00a047 of the Charter (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a095 and the case-law cited).\n188\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that effect, Article\u00a045(2)(a) of the GDPR requires the Commission, in its assessment of the adequacy of the level of protection in a third country, to take account, in particular, of \u2018effective administrative and judicial redress for the data subjects whose personal data are being transferred\u2019. Recital\u00a0104 of the GDPR states, in that regard, that the third country \u2018should ensure effective independent data protection supervision and should provide for cooperation mechanisms with the Member States\u2019 data protection authorities\u2019, and adds that \u2018the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights and effective administrative and judicial redress\u2019.\n189\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The existence of such effective redress in the third country concerned is of particular importance in the context of the transfer of personal data to that third country, since, as is apparent from recital\u00a0116 of the GDPR, data subjects may find that the administrative and judicial authorities of the Member States have insufficient powers and means to take effective action in relation to data subjects\u2019 complaints based on allegedly unlawful processing, in that third country, of their data thus transferred, which is capable of compelling them to resort to the national authorities and courts of that third country.\n190\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the Commission\u2019s finding in the Privacy Shield Decision that the United States ensures a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed in Article\u00a047 of the Charter has been called into question on the ground, inter alia, that the introduction of a Privacy Shield Ombudsperson cannot remedy the deficiencies which the Commission itself found in connection with the judicial protection of persons whose personal data is transferred to that third country.\n191\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Commission found, in recital\u00a0115 of the Privacy Shield Decision, that \u2018while individuals, including EU data subjects,\u00a0\u2026 have a number of avenues of redress when they have been the subject of unlawful (electronic) surveillance for national security purposes, it is equally clear that at least some legal bases that U.S. intelligence authorities may use (e.g. E.O.\u00a012333) are not covered\u2019. Thus, as regards E.O.\u00a012333, the Commission emphasised, in recital\u00a0115, the lack of any redress mechanism. In accordance with the case-law set out in paragraph\u00a0187 above, the existence of such a lacuna in judicial protection in respect of interferences with intelligence programmes based on that presidential decree makes it impossible to conclude, as the Commission did in the Privacy Shield Decision, that United States law ensures a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed by Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n192\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as regards both the surveillance programmes based on Section\u00a0702 of the FISA and those based on E.O.\u00a012333, it has been noted in paragraphs\u00a0181 and 182 above that neither PPD-28 nor E.O.\u00a012333 grants data subjects rights actionable in the courts against the US authorities, from which it follows that data subjects have no right to an effective remedy.\n193\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission found, however, in recitals\u00a0115 and 116 of the Privacy Shield Decision, that, as a result of the Ombudsperson Mechanism introduced by the US authorities, as described in a letter from the US Secretary of State to the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality from 7\u00a0July 2016, set out in Annex\u00a0III to that decision, and of the nature of that Ombudsperson\u2019s role, in the present instance, a \u2018Senior Coordinator for International Information Technology Diplomacy\u2019, the United States can be deemed to ensure a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed by Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n194\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An examination of whether the ombudsperson mechanism which is the subject of the Privacy Shield Decision is in fact capable of addressing the Commission\u2019s finding of limitations on the right to judicial protection must, in accordance with the requirements arising from Article\u00a047 of the Charter and the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a0187 above, start from the premiss that data subjects must have the possibility of bringing legal action before an independent and impartial court in order to have access to their personal data, or to obtain the rectification or erasure of such data.\n195\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the letter referred to in paragraph\u00a0193 above, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson, although described as \u2018independent from the Intelligence Community\u2019, was presented as \u2018[reporting] directly to the Secretary of State who will ensure that the Ombudsperson carries out its function objectively and free from improper influence that is liable to have an effect on the response to be provided\u2019. Furthermore, in addition to the fact that, as found by the Commission in recital\u00a0116 of that decision, the Ombudsperson is appointed by the Secretary of State and is an integral part of the US State Department, there is, as the Advocate General stated in point\u00a0337 of his Opinion, nothing in that decision to indicate that the dismissal or revocation of the appointment of the Ombudsperson is accompanied by any particular guarantees, which is such as to undermine the Ombudsman\u2019s independence from the executive (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0January 2020, \nBanco de Santander\n, C-274/14, EU:C:2020:17, paragraphs\u00a060 and 63 and the case-law cited).\n196\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, as the Advocate General stated, in point\u00a0338 of his Opinion, although recital\u00a0120 of the Privacy Shield Decision refers to a commitment from the US Government that the relevant component of the intelligence services is required to correct any violation of the applicable rules detected by the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson, there is nothing in that decision to indicate that that ombudsperson has the power to adopt decisions that are binding on those intelligence services and does not mention any legal safeguards that would accompany that political commitment on which data subjects could rely.\n197\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the ombudsperson mechanism to which the Privacy Shield Decision refers does not provide any cause of action before a body which offers the persons whose data is transferred to the United States guarantees essentially equivalent to those required by Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n198\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in finding, in Article\u00a01(1) of the Privacy Shield Decision, that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the Union to organisations in that third country under the EU-US Privacy Shield, the Commission disregarded the requirements of Article\u00a045(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter.\n199\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that Article\u00a01 of the Privacy Shield Decision is incompatible with Article\u00a045(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter, and is therefore invalid.\n200\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Article\u00a01 of the Privacy Shield Decision is inseparable from Articles\u00a02 and 6 of, and the annexes to, that decision, its invalidity affects the validity of the decision in its entirety.\n201\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all of the foregoing considerations, it is to be concluded that the Privacy Shield Decision is invalid.\n202\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to whether it is appropriate to maintain the effects of that decision for the purposes of avoiding the creation of a legal vacuum (see, to that effect, judgment of 28\u00a0April 2016, \nBorealis Polyolefine and Others\n, C-191/14, C-192/14, C-295/14, C-389/14 and C-391/14 to C-393/14, EU:C:2016:311, paragraph\u00a0106), the Court notes that, in any event, in view of Article\u00a049 of the GDPR, the annulment of an adequacy decision such as the Privacy Shield Decision is not liable to create such a legal vacuum. That article details the conditions under which transfers of personal data to third countries may take place in the absence of an adequacy decision under Article\u00a045(3) of the GDPR or appropriate safeguards under Article\u00a046 of the GDPR.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n203\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), must be interpreted as meaning that that regulation applies to the transfer of personal data for commercial purposes by an economic operator established in a Member State to another economic operator established in a third country, irrespective of whether, at the time of that transfer or thereafter, that data is liable to be processed by the authorities of the third country in question for the purposes of public security, defence and State security.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a046(1) and Article\u00a046(2)(c) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the appropriate safeguards, enforceable rights and effective legal remedies required by those provisions must ensure that data subjects whose personal data are transferred to a third country pursuant to standard data protection clauses are afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the European Union by that regulation, read in the light of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. To that end, the assessment of the level of protection afforded in the context of such a transfer must, in particular, take into consideration both the contractual clauses agreed between the controller or processor established in the European Union and the recipient of the transfer established in the third country concerned and, as regards any access by the public authorities of that third country to the personal data transferred, the relevant aspects of the legal system of that third country, in particular those set out, in a non-exhaustive manner, in Article\u00a045(2) of that regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a058(2)(f) and (j) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that, unless there is a valid European Commission adequacy decision, the competent supervisory authority is required to suspend or prohibit a transfer of data to a third country pursuant to standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission, if, in the view of that supervisory authority and in the light of all the circumstances of that transfer, those clauses are not or cannot be complied with in that third country and the protection of the data transferred that is required by EU law, in particular by Articles\u00a045 and 46 of that regulation and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, cannot be ensured by other means, where the controller or a processor has not itself suspended or put an end to the transfer.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nExamination of Commission Decision 2010/87/EU of 5\u00a0February 2010 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries under Directive 95/46/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, as amended by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/2297 of 16\u00a0December 2016 in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights has disclosed nothing to affect the validity of that decision.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCommission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12\u00a0July 2016 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-US Privacy Shield is invalid.\nLenaerts\nSilva\u00a0de\u00a0Lapuerta\nArabadjiev\nPrechal\nVilaras\nSafjan\nRodin\nXuereb\nRossi\nJarukaitis\nIle\u0161i\u010d\nvon\u00a0Danwitz\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0160v\u00e1by\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 16\u00a0July 2020.\nA.\u00a0Calot Escobar\n\u00a0\nK.

non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated

IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct

That website enables searches to be carried out either on the basis of general vehicle information, such as the model, engine or the year of manufacture, or on a given vehicle, by entering the last seven figures of the VIN of that vehicle. The results of those searches can only be printed or saved on the computer as a PDF file, which excludes automated use of data. The results of searches concerning information on spare parts can be saved in the form of an XML file.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the order for reference that Scania does not make the VINs available to independent operators. Only repairers have access to those data, by virtue of the registration documents or the indication on the chassis of the vehicle entrusted by the customer for the maintenance or repair of the vehicle.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gesamtverband, together with its members, accounts for 80% of the turnover in the independent trade in motor vehicle parts in Germany. Taking the view that the access to information granted by Scania falls short of the requirements imposed on it by Article\u00a061(1) and (2) of Regulation 2018/858, it requested the Landgericht K\u00f6ln (Regional Court, Cologne, Germany), the referring court, to order Scania to grant independent operators other than repairers, referred to in point\u00a045 of Article\u00a03 of that regulation, access to vehicle repair and maintenance information, within the meaning of point\u00a048 of Article\u00a03 of that regulation, through a database interface, enabling automated queries to be carried out and the results to be downloaded in the form of sets of data intended for electronic use.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court considers that the outcome of the dispute before it depends on the interpretation of Article\u00a061(1) and (2) of Regulation 2018/858. It asks, in the first place, whether the obligation imposed by paragraph\u00a01 on vehicle manufacturers to present the information in an \u2018easily accessible manner in the form of machine-readable and electronically processable datasets\u2019 covers all vehicle repair and maintenance information, within the meaning of point\u00a048 of Article\u00a03 of that regulation, or only the information relating to spare parts, referred to in the third subparagraph of point\u00a06.1 of Annex\u00a0X to that regulation, to which Article\u00a061(4) of that regulation refers.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, the referring court notes that, although Article\u00a061(1) and (2) of Regulation 2018/858 does not expressly require the vehicle manufacturer to establish a database interface, they nevertheless require that the information be presented in an \u2018easily accessible\u2019 manner. According to that court, manual consultation of that information, which it considers to be a time-consuming method of access, does not comply with that requirement.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, the referring court asks whether Article\u00a061(1) and (2) of Regulation 2018/858 must be interpreted as allowing a vehicle manufacturer to limit access, in relation to vehicle repair and maintenance information, to targeted searches by means of the VIN, without, however, making available to independent operators an up-to-date list of all the VINs of its vehicles.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fourth place, the referring court notes that Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2018/858, in so far as it requires independent operators to be provided with the information which it sets out in the form of \u2018machine-readable and electronically processable datasets\u2019, does not mean that the file format may be processed directly electronically, without an intermediate step such as conversion into another file format. It doubts, however, whether the tables and texts of a PDF file can be regarded as complying with Directive 2019/1024, recital\u00a035 of which states that, in order for a document to be regarded as being in machine-readable format, it must be in a structured file format, so that software applications can easily identify and recognise specific data and extract them.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fifth place, the referring court, while taking the view that, as a general rule, the VIN does not constitute personal data, questions whether Article\u00a061 of Regulation 2018/858 must be interpreted as imposing on vehicle manufacturers a legal obligation to process data, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(c) of the GDPR.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Landgericht K\u00f6ln (Regional Court, Cologne) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the requirement laid down in the second sentence of Article\u00a061(1) of [Regulation 2018/858]\u00a0\u2026 cover all vehicle repair and maintenance information within the meaning of point\u00a048 of Article\u00a03 of that regulation, or is that requirement limited to \u2018spare parts information\u2019\u00a0\u2026 referred to in point\u00a06.1 of Annex\u00a0X to that regulation?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the second sentence of Article\u00a061(1) [and (2), second subparagraph, of Regulation No\u00a02018/858] be interpreted as meaning that the vehicle manufacturer fulfils its obligations in that regard only by:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0making the information accessible via the internet by means of a machine-controlled query via a database interface, which provides the possibility to download the results, or is it sufficient that the vehicle manufacturer enables only a manual search by a human user on-screen on a website and limits the result of the query to the visible content of the pages displayed on-screen?\nand\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0making it possible for all information in the database linked to the vehicle manufacturer\u2019s vehicle identification numbers (VINs) to be searched for on the basis of those VINs, which are to be provided by it in a separate list, and, independently of that possibility,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0also on the basis of other vehicle identification characteristics in accordance with the third subparagraph of point\u00a06.1 of Annex\u00a0X to [Regulation 2018/858]\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and on the basis of the terms that the vehicle manufacturer otherwise uses for categories (such as categories of components, spare parts, repair and maintenance instructions and technical illustrations) and other database entries in any combination\nor is it sufficient that the manufacturer offers the search exclusively as an individual query based on the VIN of a single, specific vehicle without at the same time providing an up-to-date list of all its vehicles\u2019 VINs?\nand\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0providing those datasets in files in a format which is intended to make the datasets contained therein directly amenable to (further) electronic processing, the description of the dataset concerned being specified (in the case of texts and tables), or is the possibility to export mere screenshots in any conventional file format, such as a PDF file, sufficient for that purpose?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation [2018/858] constitute, for vehicle manufacturers, a legal obligation within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(c) of the GDPR which justifies the disclosure of VINs or information linked to VINs to independent operators as other controllers within the meaning of point\u00a07 of Article\u00a04 of the GDPR?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the second sentence of Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2018/858 must be interpreted as meaning that the obligation to present the information referred to in that paragraph in an easily accessible manner, in the form of machine-readable and electronically processable data sets, covers all \u2018vehicle repair and maintenance information\u2019, within the meaning of point\u00a048 of Article\u00a03 of that regulation, or only the information relating to the spare parts referred to in point\u00a06.1 of Annex\u00a0X to that regulation.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first sentence of Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2018/858 requires vehicle manufacturers to provide independent operators with unrestricted, standardised and non-discriminatory access, inter alia, to \u2018vehicle repair and maintenance information\u2019, within the meaning of point\u00a048 of Article\u00a03 of that regulation. Under the second sentence of Article\u00a061(1) of that regulation, all such information must be presented in an easily accessible manner, in the form of machine-readable and electronically processable data sets.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It thus follows from the wording itself of that provision that the obligation which it lays down covers the same information as that referred to in the first sentence of Article\u00a061(1) of that regulation, namely, in particular, vehicle repair and maintenance information.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although, under Article\u00a061(4) of Regulation 2018/858, \u2018the details of the technical requirements for access\u00a0\u2026 to vehicle repair and maintenance information, in particular technical specifications on how vehicle OBD information and vehicle repair and maintenance information are to be provided, are laid down in Annex\u00a0X\u2019, and although the third paragraph of point\u00a06.1 of that annex refers only to information on vehicle parts which can be replaced by spare parts, the fact remains that the latter provision does not itself govern the extent of access to vehicle repair and maintenance information. It cannot therefore have the effect of reducing the vehicle repair and maintenance information to that relating to spare parts.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that the second sentence of Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2018/858 must be interpreted as meaning that the obligation to present the information referred to in that paragraph in an easily accessible manner, in the form of machine-readable and electronically processable datasets, covers all \u2018vehicle repair and maintenance information\u2019, within the meaning of \n\u00a0\npoint\u00a048 of Article\u00a03 of that regulation, and not only the information relating to spare parts referred to in point\u00a06.1 of Annex\u00a0X to that regulation.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the second sentence of Article\u00a061(1) and the second subparagraph of Article\u00a061(2) of Regulation 2018/858 must be interpreted as meaning that it requires vehicle manufacturers, first, to make vehicle repair and maintenance information accessible via a database interface enabling automated searches with downloading of results, second, to establish a database enabling search on the basis not only of the VIN but also of additional means and, third, to make that information available to independent operators in files the format of which allows the direct electronic use of the sets of data contained in those files.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, as has been recalled in paragraph\u00a026 of the present judgment, Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2018/858 requires vehicle manufacturers to provide independent operators with unrestricted, standardised and non-discriminatory access, inter alia, to vehicle repair and maintenance information and to present it in a manner that is \u2018easily accessible, in the form of machine-readable and electronically processable datasets\u2019.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first sentence of the second subparagraph of Article\u00a061(2) requires those manufacturers to make vehicle repair and maintenance information available on their websites in a standardised format or, if that is not feasible due to the nature of the information, in another appropriate format. The second sentence of that second subparagraph requires those manufacturers to provide that information to independent operators other than repairers in a machine-readable format, capable of being electronically processed by means of generally available computer tools and software, so that those operators can carry out their activities in the supply chain of the market for spare parts and equipment (see, to that effect, judgment of 27\u00a0October 2022, \nADPA and Gesamtverband Autoteile-Handel\n, C-390/21, EU:C:2022:837, paragraph\u00a028).\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Until the adoption by the Commission of an appropriate standard, the same manufacturers must, under the first subparagraph of Article\u00a061(2) of Regulation 2018/858, present that information in an \u2018easily accessible\u2019 manner in such a way that it can be processed by independent operators \u2018with reasonable effort\u2019.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Article\u00a061 of that regulation does not impose an obligation on vehicle manufacturers to set up an interface that can be used to search those manufacturers\u2019 databases.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, under the third paragraph of point\u00a06.1 of Annex\u00a0X to Regulation 2018/858, to which Article\u00a061(4) of that regulation refers, \u2018information on all parts of the vehicle, with which the vehicle, as identified by the VIN and any additional criteria such as wheelbase, engine output, trim level or options, is equipped by the vehicle manufacturer and that can be replaced by spare parts offered by the vehicle manufacturer to its authorised repairers or dealers or third parties by means of reference to original equipment (OE) parts number, shall be made available, in the form of machine readable and electronically processable datasets, in a database that is easily accessible to independent operators\u2019.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the wording itself of the third paragraph of point\u00a06.1 that, as regards information on parts that can be replaced by spare parts, manufacturers are required to create a database (see, to that effect, judgment of 19\u00a0September 2019, \nGesamtverband Autoteile-Handel\n, C-527/18, EU:C:2019:762, paragraph\u00a032), allowing searches to be carried out using not only the VIN but also the \u2018additional criteria\u2019 provided for in that provision.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is consistent with the objective of ensuring effective competition on the market for vehicle repair and maintenance information services, as set out in recitals\u00a050 and 52 of Regulation 2018/858. To that end, independent operators, such as publishers of technical information and manufacturers of parts, must be able, in order to carry out their activities in the supply chain of the spare parts and equipment market, to carry out searches by all the means listed in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, the manufacturers\u2019 obligation to make vehicle repair and maintenance information available to independent operators in a form amenable to electronic processing, laid down in Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2018/858, must enable those operators to \u2018retrieve the technical information\u2019 (see, to that effect, judgment of 27\u00a0October 2022, \nADPA and Gesamtverband Autoteile-Handel\n, C-390/21, EU:C:2022:837, paragraph\u00a027).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it should be noted that, according to recital\u00a035 of Directive 2019/1024, in order for a document to be regarded as being in machine-readable format, it must be presented \u2018in a file format structured in such a way that software applications can easily identify and recognise and extract specific data from it\u2019.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the order for reference that making information available in a format such as that offered by Scania lends itself only to indirect electronic processing and requires those operators to carry out intermediate stages of file conversion which do not allow automated processing in a directly processable format. Subject to the checks which it is ultimately for the referring court to carry out, such making available cannot be regarded as complying with the second sentence of Article\u00a061(1) and the second subparagraph of Article\u00a061(2) of Regulation 2018/858.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is consistent with the objective of ensuring effective competition on the market for vehicle repair and maintenance information services, as set out in recitals\u00a050 and 52 of Regulation 2018/858. To that end, it is essential, as the Commission pointed out in its written observations, that independent operators should be able to extract technical data from the format by which manufacturers make the necessary information available to them and to retain those data immediately after their retrieval for re-use.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the second question is that the second sentence of Article\u00a061(1) and the second subparagraph of Article\u00a061(2) of Regulation 2018/858 must be interpreted as meaning that:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0it does not require vehicle manufacturers to make vehicle repair and maintenance information accessible by means of a database interface allowing automated search with downloading of results, but requires them to make that information available to independent operators in files the format of which allows for direct electronic processing of the sets of data contained in those files;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0read in conjunction with Article\u00a061(4) of that regulation and the third subparagraph of point\u00a06.1 of Annex\u00a0X thereto, it requires vehicle manufacturers to establish a database making it possible to search for information on all the original parts of the vehicle on the basis not only of the VIN but also of the additional means provided for in that provision.\n\u00a0\nThe third question\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2018/858 must be interpreted as establishing a \u2018legal obligation\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(c) of the GDPR, on vehicle manufacturers, to make the VINs of the vehicles that they manufacture available to independent operators, as \u2018controllers\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of that regulation.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer that question, it is necessary to examine, first, whether the VIN falls within the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR, which defines that concept as \u2018any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That definition is applicable where, by reason of its content, purpose and effect, the information in question is linked to a particular natural person (judgment of 8\u00a0December 2022, \nInspektor\n v \nInspektorata kam Visshia sadeben savet (Purposes of the processing of personal data\u00a0\u2013 Criminal investigation)\n, C-180/21, EU:C:2022:967, paragraph\u00a070). In order to determine whether a natural person is identifiable, directly or indirectly, account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be used either by the controller, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR, or by any other person, to identify that person, without, however, requiring that all the information enabling that person to be identified should be in the hands of a single entity (see, to that effect, judgment of 19\u00a0October 2016, \nBreyer\n (C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraphs\u00a042 and 43).\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in points\u00a034 and 39 of his Opinion, a datum such as the VIN\u00a0\u2013 which is defined by Article\u00a02(2) of Regulation No\u00a019/2011 as an alphanumeric code assigned to the vehicle by its manufacturer in order to ensure that the vehicle is properly identified and which, as such, is not \u2018personal\u2019\u00a0\u2013 becomes personal as regards someone who reasonably has means enabling that datum to be associated with a specific person.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from point\u00a0II.5 of Annex\u00a0I to Directive 1999/37 that the VIN must appear on the registration certificate for a vehicle, as must the name and address of the holder of that certificate. In addition, under points\u00a0II.5 and II.6 of that annex, a natural person may be designated in that certificate as the owner of the vehicle, or as a person who can use the vehicle on a legal basis other than that of owner.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the VIN constitutes personal data, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR, of the natural person referred to in that certificate, in so far as the person who has access to it may have means enabling him to use it to identify the owner of the vehicle to which it relates or the person who may use that vehicle on a legal basis other than that of owner.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in points\u00a034 and 41 of his Opinion, where independent operators may reasonably have at their disposal the means enabling them to link a VIN to an identified or identifiable natural person, which it is for the referring court to determine, that VIN constitutes personal data for them, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR, and, indirectly, for the vehicle manufacturers making it available, even if the VIN is not, in itself, personal data for them, and is not personal data for them in particular where the vehicle to which the VIN has been assigned does not belong to a natural person.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If it follows from the determination referred to in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment that a VIN must be regarded as personal data, it falls within the scope of the GDPR, pursuant to Article\u00a02(1) thereof, and must therefore be processed in accordance with that regulation.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concept of \u2018processing\u2019 is defined in Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR as any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available. That concept therefore covers the making available of a VIN by the \u2018controller\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of that regulation, where that VIN makes it possible to identify a natural person.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06 of the GDPR lays down the conditions for the lawfulness of the processing of such data. In accordance with paragraph\u00a01(c) of that article, processing is lawful where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06(3) of the GDPR states, moreover, that that processing must be based on EU law or on Member State law to which the controller is subject and that that legal basis must define the purposes of the processing and meet a public interest objective, and be proportionate to the pursuit of such an objective.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As stated in recital\u00a062 of Regulation 2018/858, the rules on the protection of personal data must be applied whenever the measures provided for in that regulation entail the processing of personal data.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is in the light of the foregoing that it is necessary to examine, secondly, the content and scope of Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2018/858.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That provision, as has already been pointed out in paragraphs\u00a026 and 31 of the present judgment, requires, first of all, vehicle manufacturers to make available to independent operators, inter alia, vehicle repair and maintenance information, defined in point\u00a048 of Article\u00a03 of that regulation as \u2018all information, including all subsequent amendments and supplements thereto, that is required for diagnosing, servicing and inspecting a vehicle, preparing it for road worthiness testing, repairing, re-programming or re-initialising of a vehicle, or that is required for the remote diagnostic support of a vehicle or for the fitting on a vehicle of parts and equipment, and that is provided by the manufacturer to his authorised partners, dealers and repairers or is used by the manufacturer for the repair and maintenance purposes.\u2019\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Annex\u00a0X to Regulation 2018/858, to which Article\u00a061(4) of that regulation refers, states, in point\u00a02.5.1, that vehicle repair and maintenance information is to include \u2018an unequivocal identification of the vehicle\u2019. Furthermore, in accordance with the fourth paragraph of point\u00a06.1 of that annex, the VIN is to appear in the database that the manufacturer is required to establish, pursuant to the third subparagraph of point\u00a06.1, concerning the original parts of the vehicle that can be replaced by spare parts.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those provisions of EU law thus impose on vehicle manufacturers the \u2018legal obligation\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(c) of the GDPR, to make available to independent operators, among other data, the VINs. Such a \u2018legal obligation\u2019 satisfies the first condition for the lawfulness of the processing of personal data set out in paragraph\u00a052 of the present judgment.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2018/858 defines the purpose of that data processing obligation, which is to provide independent operators with unrestricted, standardised and non-discriminatory access to, inter alia, vehicle repair and maintenance information within the meaning of point\u00a048 of Article\u00a03 of that regulation. The \u2018legal obligation\u2019 for manufacturers to make the VINs of their vehicles available to independent operators therefore meets the objective, set out in recital\u00a052 of that regulation, of ensuring effective and undistorted competition on the market for vehicle repair and maintenance information services.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to recital\u00a050 of Regulation 2018/858, such competition is necessary in order to improve the functioning of the internal market, in particular as regards the free movement of goods, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services. Therefore, the objective referred to in the preceding paragraph is in the public interest and, accordingly, legitimate (see, by analogy, judgment of 1\u00a0August 2022, \nVyriausioji tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija\n, C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601, paragraph\u00a075). The second condition for the lawfulness of the processing of personal data set out in paragraph\u00a053 of the present judgment is thus satisfied.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, lastly, the third condition for the lawfulness of the processing of personal data, laid down in Article\u00a06(3) of the GDPR and requiring that that processing be \u2018proportionate to the legitimate objective pursued\u2019, it is sufficient to note, as the Advocate General did in the fourth indent of point\u00a052 of his Opinion, first, that only the search using the VIN enables the data corresponding to a particular vehicle to be accurately identified and, second, that the file before the Court does not refer to any other less restrictive means of identification which, at the same time, would be as effective as search on the basis of the VIN and would enable the public interest objective identified in the preceding paragraph to be pursued. Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2018/858 thus satisfies the third condition referred to in paragraph\u00a053 of the present judgment.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the third question is that Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2018/858, read in conjunction with Article\u00a061(4) and point\u00a06.1 of Annex\u00a0X to that regulation, must be interpreted as meaning that it establishes a \u2018legal obligation\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(c) of the GDPR, on car manufacturers, to make the VINs of the vehicles which they manufacture available to independent operators, as \u2018controllers\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of that regulation.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe second sentence of Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30\u00a0May 2018 on the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, amending Regulations (EC) No\u00a0715/2007 and (EC) No\u00a0595/2009 and repealing Directive 2007/46/EC,\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the obligation to present the information referred to in that paragraph in an easily accessible manner, in the form of machine-readable and electronically processable datasets, covers all \u2018vehicle repair and maintenance information\u2019, within the meaning of point\u00a048 of Article\u00a03 of that regulation, and not only the information relating to spare parts referred to in point\u00a06.1 of Annex\u00a0X to that regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe second sentence of Article\u00a061(1) and the second subparagraph of Article\u00a061(2) of Regulation 2018/858\nmust be interpreted as meaning that:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nit does not require vehicle manufacturers to make vehicle repair and maintenance information accessible by means of a database interface allowing automated search with downloading of results, but requires them to make that information available to independent operators in files the format of which serves for direct electronic processing of the sets of data contained in those files;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nread in conjunction with Article\u00a061(4) of that regulation and the third subparagraph of point\u00a06.1 of Annex\u00a0X thereto, it requires vehicle manufacturers to establish a database making it possible to search for information on all the original parts of the vehicle on the basis not only of the vehicle identification number (VIN) but also of the additional means provided for in that provision.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2018/858, read in conjunction with Article\u00a061(4) and with point\u00a06.1 of Annex\u00a0X to that regulation,\nmust be interpreted as meaning that it establishes a \u2018legal obligation\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), on car manufacturers, to make the VINs of the vehicles which they manufacture available to independent operators, as \u2018controllers\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of that regulation."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f),

Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 21 Jun 2022, C-817/19 (\nLigue des droits humains\n)\n \nJUDGMENT OF THE COURT

Member States may entrust competent authorities within the meaning of [Directive 2016/680] with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so that the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is within the scope of [EU] law, falls within the scope of this Regulation.\n\u2026\u2019\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a02 of that regulation, entitled \u2018Material scope\u2019, provides in its paragraphs\u00a01 and 2:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of [EU] law;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Chapter\u00a02 of Title V [TEU];\n\u2026\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.\u2019\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04 of that regulation, entitled \u2018Definitions\u2019, provides:\n\u2018For the purposes of this Regulation:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cpersonal data\u201d means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u00a0\u2026;\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cprocessing\u201d means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\n\u2026\u2019\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a023 of the GDPR, entitled \u2018Restrictions\u2019, provides:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[EU] or Member State law to which the data controller or processor is subject may restrict by way of a legislative measure the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Articles\u00a012 to 22 and Article\u00a034, as well as in Article\u00a05 in so far as its provisions correspond to the rights and obligations provided for in Articles\u00a012 to 22, when such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0national security;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0defence;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0public security;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security;\n\u2026\n(h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a monitoring, inspection or regulatory function connected, even occasionally, to the exercise of official authority in the cases referred to in points (a) to (e) and (g);\n\u2026\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, any legislative measure referred to in paragraph\u00a01 shall contain specific provisions at least, where relevant, as to:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the purposes of the processing or categories of processing;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the categories of personal data;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the scope of the restrictions introduced;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the safeguards to prevent abuse or unlawful access or transfer;\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the specification of the controller or categories of controllers;\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the storage periods and the applicable safeguards taking into account the nature, scope and purposes of the processing or categories of processing;\n(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects;

Such competent authorities may include not only public authorities such as the judicial authorities, the police or other law-enforcement authorities but also any other body or entity entrusted by Member State law to exercise public authority and public powers for the purposes of this Directive. Where such a body or entity processes personal data for purposes other than for the purposes of this Directive, [the GDPR] applies. [The GDPR] therefore applies in cases where a body or entity collects personal data for other purposes and further processes those personal data in order to comply with a legal obligation to which it is subject. For example, for the purposes of investigation detection or prosecution of criminal offences financial institutions retain certain personal data which are processed by them, and provide those personal data only to the competent national authorities in specific cases and in accordance with Member State law. A body or entity which processes personal data on behalf of such authorities within the scope of this Directive should be bound by a contract or other legal act and by the provisions applicable to processors pursuant to this Directive, while the application of [the GDPR] remains unaffected for the processing of personal data by the processor outside the scope of this Directive.\u2019\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01 of that directive, entitled \u2018Subject matter and objectives\u2019, which corresponds, in essence, to Article\u00a01 of Framework Decision 2008/977, provides, in its paragraph\u00a01:\n\u2018This Directive lays down the rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.\u2019\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a03 of that directive, entitled \u2018Definitions\u2019:\n\u2018For the purposes of this Directive:\n\u2026\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201ccompetent authority\u201d means:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any public authority competent for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security; or\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any other body or entity entrusted by Member State law to exercise public authority and public powers for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security;\n\u2026\u2019\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe PNR Directive\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a04 to 12, 15, 19, 20, 22, 25, 27, 28, 33, 36 and 37 of the PNR Directive state:\n\u2018(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[The API Directive] regulates the transfer of advance passenger information (API) data by air carriers to the competent national authorities for the purpose of improving border controls and combating illegal immigration.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The objectives of this Directive are, inter alia, to ensure security, to protect the life and safety of persons, and to create a legal framework for the protection of PNR data with regard to their processing by competent authorities.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective use of PNR data, for example by comparing PNR data against various databases on persons and objects sought, is necessary to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist offences and serious crime and thus enhance internal security, to gather evidence and, where relevant, to find associates of criminals and unravel criminal networks.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assessment of PNR data allows identification of persons who were unsuspected of involvement in terrorist offences or serious crime prior to such an assessment and who should be subject to further examination by the competent authorities. By using PNR data it is possible to address the threat of terrorist offences and serious crime from a different perspective than through the processing of other categories of personal data. However, to ensure that the processing of PNR data remains limited to what is necessary, the creation and application of assessment criteria should be limited to terrorist offences and serious crime for which the use of such criteria is relevant. Furthermore, the assessment criteria should be defined in a manner which keeps to a minimum the number of innocent people wrongly identified by the system.\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Air carriers already collect and process their passengers\u2019 PNR data for their own commercial purposes. This Directive should not impose any obligation on air carriers to collect or retain any additional data from passengers or any obligation on passengers to provide any data in addition to that already being provided to air carriers.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some air carriers retain as part of the PNR data the API data they collect, while others do not. The use of PNR data together with API data has added value in assisting Member States in verifying the identity of an individual, thus reinforcing the law enforcement value of that result and minimising the risk of carrying out checks and investigations on innocent people. It is therefore important to ensure that where air carriers collect API data, they transfer it irrespective of whether they retain API data by different technical means as for other PNR data.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist offences and serious crime, it is essential that all Member States introduce provisions laying down obligations on air carriers operating extra-EU flights to transfer PNR data they collect, including API data. Member States should also have the possibility to extend this obligation to air carriers operating intra-EU flights. Those provisions should be without prejudice to [the API Directive].\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data should be proportionate to the specific security goals pursued by this Directive.\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The definition of terrorist offences applied in this Directive should be the same as in Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA [of 13\u00a0June 2002 on combating terrorism (OJ 2002 L\u00a0164, p.\u00a03)]. The definition of serious crime should encompass the categories of offence listed in Annex\u00a0II to this Directive.\n\u2026\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A list of the PNR data to be obtained by a [passenger information unit (PIU)] should be drawn up with the objective of reflecting the legitimate requirements of public authorities to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist offences or serious crime, thereby improving internal security within the Union as well as protecting the fundamental rights, in particular privacy and the protection of personal data. To that end, high standards should be applied in accordance with [the Charter], the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (\u201cConvention No\u00a0108\u201d), and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedom[, signed at Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950] (the \u201cECHR\u201d). Such a list should not be based on a person\u2019s race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, trade union membership, health, sexual life or sexual orientation. The PNR data should only contain details of passengers\u2019 reservations and travel itineraries that enable competent authorities to identify air passengers representing a threat to internal security.\n\u2026\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State should be responsible for assessing the potential threats related to terrorist offences and serious crime.\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking fully into consideration the right to the protection of personal data and the right to non-discrimination, no decision that produces an adverse legal effect on a person or significantly affects that person should be taken only by reason of the automated processing of PNR data. Moreover, in respect of Articles\u00a08 and 21 of the Charter, no such decision should discriminate on any grounds such as a person\u2019s sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation. The [European] Commission should also take those principles into account when reviewing the application of this Directive.\n\u2026\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking fully into consideration the principles outlined in recent relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the application of this Directive should ensure full respect for fundamental rights, for the right to privacy and for the principle of proportionality. It should also genuinely meet the objectives of necessity and proportionality in order to achieve the general interests recognised by the [European] Union and the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others in the fight against terrorist offences and serious crime. The application of this Directive should be duly justified and the necessary safeguards put in place to ensure the lawfulness of any storage, analysis, transfer or use of PNR data.\n\u2026\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The period during which PNR data are to be retained should be as long as is necessary for and proportionate to the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. Because of the nature of the data and their uses, it is necessary that the PNR data be retained for a sufficiently long period to carry out analysis and for use in investigations. To avoid disproportionate use, after the initial retention period the PNR data should be depersonalised through masking out of data elements. To ensure the highest level of data protection, access to the full PNR data, which enable direct identification of the data subject, should be granted only under very strict and limited conditions after that initial period.\n\u2026\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of PNR data in each Member State by the PIU and by competent authorities should be subject to a standard of protection of personal data under national law in line with Framework Decision [2008/977] and the specific data protection requirements laid down in this Directive. References to Framework Decision [2008/977] should be understood as references to legislation currently in force as well as to legislation that will replace it.\n(28)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking into consideration the right to the protection of personal data, the rights of data subjects concerning the processing of their PNR data, such as the rights of access, rectification, erasure and restriction and the rights to compensation and judicial redress, should be in line both with Framework Decision [2008/977] and with the high level of protection provided by the Charter and the ECHR.\n\u2026\n(33)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive does not affect the possibility for Member States to provide, under their national law, for a system of collecting and processing PNR data from non-carrier economic operators, such as travel agencies and tour operators which provide travel-related services\u00a0\u2013 including the booking of flights\u00a0\u2013 for which they collect and process PNR data, or from transportation providers other than those specified in this Directive, provided that such national law complies with [EU] law.\n\u2026\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive respects the fundamental rights and the principles of the Charter, in particular the right to the protection of personal data, the right to privacy and the right to non-discrimination as protected by Articles\u00a08, 7 and 21 thereof; it should therefore be implemented accordingly. This Directive is compatible with data protection principles and its provisions are in line with Framework Decision [2008/977]. Furthermore, to comply with the proportionality principle, on specific issues this Directive provides for stricter rules on data protection than Framework Decision [2008/977].\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scope of this Directive is as limited as possible since: it provides for the retention of PNR data in the PIUs for a period of time not exceeding five years, after which the data should be deleted; it provides for the data to be depersonalised through masking out of data elements after an initial period of six months; and it prohibits the collection and use of sensitive data. To ensure efficiency and a high level of data protection, Member States are required to ensure that an independent national supervisory authority and, in particular, a data protection officer are responsible for advising and monitoring the way PNR data are processed. All processing of PNR data should be logged or documented for the purposes of verifying its legality, self-monitoring and ensuring proper data integrity and secure processing. Member States should also ensure that passengers are clearly and precisely informed about the collection of PNR data and their rights.\u2019\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01 of the PNR Directive, entitled \u2018Subject matter and scope\u2019, is worded as follows:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive provides for:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the transfer by air carriers of passenger name record (PNR) data of passengers of extra-EU flights,\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the processing of the data referred to in point (a), including its collection, use and retention by Member States and its exchange between Member States.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PNR data collected in accordance with this Directive may be processed only for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime, as provided for in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article\u00a06(2).\u2019\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a02 of that directive, entitled \u2018Application of this Directive to intra-EU flights\u2019:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If a Member State decides to apply this Directive to intra-EU flights, it shall notify the Commission in writing.

According to the referring court, it follows from the \ntravaux pr\u00e9paratoires\n that that law seeks to \u2018create a legal framework requiring international passenger transport carriers in various sectors (air, rail, international road and sea), as well as tour operators, to transfer data on their passengers to a database managed by the [Service public f\u00e9d\u00e9ral int\u00e9rieur (Home Affairs Federal Public Service, Belgium)]\u2019. The national legislature also stated that the intended purposes of the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016 fall into three categories, namely (i) the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or the enforcement of criminal penalties; (ii) the tasks of the intelligence and security services; and (iii) improving external border controls and combating illegal immigration.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In support of its action, the Ligue des droits humains raises two pleas, the first, alleging breach of Article\u00a022 of the Constitution, read in conjunction with Article\u00a023 of the GDPR, Articles\u00a07, 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter as well as Article\u00a08 ECHR, and the second, alleging, in the alternative, breach of Article\u00a022 of the Charter, read in conjunction with Article\u00a03(2) TEU and Article\u00a045 of the Charter.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first plea, the Ligue des droits humains submits, in essence, that that law entails an interference with the rights to respect for private life and the protection of personal data, which does not comply with Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter and, inter alia, the principle of proportionality. The scope of that law and the definition of the data collected, which may reveal sensitive information, are too broad. Similarly, the concept of \u2018passenger\u2019, within the meaning of that same law, leads to systematic, non-targeted automated processing of the data of all passengers. Moreover, the nature and detailed rules of the \u2018pre-screening\u2019 method and the databases against which those data are compared, once transmitted, are not defined in a sufficiently clear manner. Furthermore, the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016 pursues objectives other than those of the PNR Directive. Finally, the five-year period laid down by that law for the retention of those data is disproportionate.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second plea, concerning Article\u00a03(1), Article\u00a08(2) and Articles\u00a028 to 31 of the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016, the Ligue des droits humains submits that, by extending the system provided for by the PNR Directive to intra-EU transport operations, those provisions have the effect of indirectly restoring internal border control, in breach of the free movement of persons. Once a person is on Belgian territory, whether on arrival, departure or during a stop-over, their data are automatically collected.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Council of Ministers disputes those arguments. It considers, in particular, that the first plea is inadmissible in so far as it concerns the GDPR, which is not applicable to the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016. Furthermore, the processing of data provided for by that law, in accordance with the PNR Directive, is an essential tool for, inter alia, the fight against terrorism and serious crime, and the measures stemming from that law are necessary to achieve the aims pursued and are proportionate.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the first plea, the referring court asks, first of all, whether the protection provided for by the GDPR applies to the processing of data established by the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016, which is intended to implement, primarily, the PNR Directive. Next, that court notes, with reference to the case-law stemming from Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017 (EU:C:2017:592), that the definition of PNR data in Article\u00a03(5) of and Annex\u00a0I to that directive may, first, not be sufficiently clear and precise, on account of the non-exhaustive nature of the description of some of those data contained in those provisions and, secondly, lead indirectly to the disclosure of sensitive data. Furthermore, the definition of the concept of \u2018passenger\u2019 in Article\u00a03(4) of that directive may result in the collection, transfer, processing and retention of PNR data constituting generalised and indiscriminate obligations, applying to every person carried or to be carried who appears on the passengers list, regardless of whether there are serious grounds for believing that that person has committed or is about to commit an offence or has been found guilty of an offence.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court also observes that PNR data, in accordance with the provisions of the PNR Directive, are systematically subject to advance assessment involving cross-checks with databases or pre-determined criteria with a view to finding matches. The Consultative Committee of Convention No\u00a0108 of the Council of Europe indicated in its Opinion of 19\u00a0August 2016 on the Data protection implications of the processing of Passenger Name Records (T-PD(2016)18rev) that the processing of personal data concerns all passengers and not only the targeted individuals suspected of involvement in a criminal offence or posing an immediate threat to national security or public order, and that PNR data may not only be compared (\u2018data matching\u2019) to databases but also be processed by \u2018data mining\u2019 according to selectors or predictive algorithms, with the aim of identifying anyone who may be involved or might engage in criminal activities, as this assessment of passengers by data mining may raise the question of predictability, in particular when operated on the basis of predictive algorithms using dynamic criteria that may constantly evolve in light of self-learning capacities. In that context, the referring court considers that, although the pre-determined criteria for identifying high-risk profiles must be specific, reliable and non-discriminatory, in accordance with Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017 (EU:C:2017:592), it seems to be impossible technically to define those criteria further.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the five-year retention period and access to the data provided for in Article\u00a012 of the PNR Directive, the referring court notes that the Commission for the protection of privacy (Belgium), in its avis d\u2019initiative no 01/2010 du 13 janvier 2010 relatif au projet de loi portant assentiment \u00e0 l\u2019accord PNR UE-\u00c9tats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique (own-initiative Opinion No\u00a001/2010 of 13\u00a0January 2010 on the Draft law ratifying the PNR Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America), considered that when data is retained for a long period and is stored \nen masse\n, the risk of the data subjects being profiled rises, as does the potential for improper use of the data for purposes other than those originally intended. It is also apparent from the Opinion of 19\u00a0August 2016 of the Consultative Committee of Convention No\u00a0108 of the Council of Europe that masked out data still enables individuals to be identified and continue as such to constitute personal data, and that their retention should be limited in time in order to avoid permanent and general surveillance.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, having regard to the case-law resulting in particular from Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017 (EU:C:2017:592), the referring court asks whether the system for the collection, transfer, processing and retention of PNR data established by the PNR Directive may be regarded as coming within the limits of what is strictly necessary. That court considers that it is also appropriate to ascertain whether that directive precludes national legislation authorising the processing of PNR data for a purpose other than that provided for by that directive and whether disclosure of the full data after they have been depersonalised, pursuant to Article\u00a012 of that directive, may be approved by a national authority such as the PIU created by the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the second plea, the referring court states that Article\u00a03(1) of that law lays down the obligations of carriers and tour operators regarding the transfer of data relating to passengers \u2018travelling to or from or transiting through Belgian territory\u2019. That court adds, with regard to the scope of that law, that the national legislature decided to \u2018inclu[de] intra-EU travel in the data collection\u2019 in order to obtain \u2018a fuller picture of passenger movements representing a potential threat to intra-Community and national security\u2019, as envisaged by Article\u00a02 of the PNR Directive, read in conjunction with recital\u00a010 thereof, for flights within the European Union. The referring court also states that the Commission for the protection of privacy, in its Opinion No\u00a055/2015 of 16\u00a0December 2015 on the draft bill which became the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016, had raised the issue of whether the Belgian PNR system might conflict with the principle of the free movement of persons, in so far as that system includes transport operations carried out within the European Union.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is in those circumstances that the Cour constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court) decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a023 of [the GDPR], read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(2)(d) of that regulation, to be interpreted as applying to national legislation such as the [Law of 25\u00a0December 2016], which transposes [the PNR Directive] as well as [the API Directive] and Directive [2010/65]?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Annex\u00a0I to [the PNR Directive] compatible with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 52(1) of [the Charter], given that the data it refers to are very wide in scope\u00a0\u2013 particularly the data referred to in paragraph\u00a018 of Annex\u00a0I to [that directive], which go beyond the data referred to in Article\u00a03(2) of [the API Directive]\u00a0\u2013 and also given that, taken together, they may reveal sensitive information, and thus go beyond what is \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are paragraphs\u00a012 and 18 of Annex\u00a0I to [the PNR Directive] compatible with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 52(1) of [the Charter], given that, having regard to the word \u201cincluding\u201d, the data referred to in those paragraphs is given by way of example and not exhaustively, such that the requirement for precision and clarity in rules which interfere with the right to respect for private life and the right to protection of personal data is not satisfied?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are Article\u00a03(4) of [the PNR Directive] and Annex\u00a0I to that directive compatible with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 52(1) of [the Charter], given that the system of generalised collection, transfer and processing of passenger data established by those provisions relates to any person using the mode of transport concerned, regardless of whether there is any objective ground for considering that that person may present a risk to public security?\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a06 of [the PNR Directive], read in conjunction with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 52(1) of [the Charter], to be interpreted as precluding national legislation such as the contested law, which includes, among the purposes for which PNR data is processed, [monitoring] activities within the remit of the intelligence and security services, thus treating that purpose as an integral part of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime?\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a06 of [the PNR Directive] compatible with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 52(1) of [the Charter], given that the advance assessment for which it provides, which is made by comparing passenger data against databases and pre-determined criteria, applies to such data in a systematic and generalised manner, regardless of whether there is any objective ground for considering that the passengers concerned may present a risk to public security?\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can the expression \u201canother national authority competent under national law\u201d in Article\u00a012(3) of [the PNR Directive] be interpreted as including the PIU created by the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016, which would then have power to authorise access to PNR data after six months had passed, for the purposes of ad hoc searches?\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a012 of [the PNR Directive], read in conjunction with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 52(1) of [the Charter], to be interpreted as precluding national legislation such as the contested law which provides for a general data retention period of five years, without making any distinction in terms of whether the advance assessment indicated that the passengers might present a risk to public security?\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is [the API Directive] compatible with Article\u00a03(2) [TEU] and Article\u00a045 of [the Charter], given that the obligations for which it provides apply to flights within the European Union?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is [the API Directive], read in conjunction with Article\u00a03(2) [TEU] and Article\u00a045 of [the Charter], to be interpreted as precluding national legislation such as the contested law which, for the purposes of combating illegal immigration and improving border controls, authorises a system of collection and processing of data relating to passengers \u201ctravelling to, from or transiting through Belgian territory\u201d, which may indirectly involve a re-establishment of internal border controls?\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, on the basis of the answers to the preceding questions, the Cour constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court) concludes that the contested law, which transposes, inter alia, [the PNR Directive], fails to fulfil one or more of the obligations arising under the provisions referred to in those questions, would it be open to it to maintain the effects of the [Law of 25\u00a0December 2016], on a temporary basis, in order to avoid legal uncertainty and enable the data hitherto collected and retained to continue to be used for the purposes envisaged by the law?\u2019\nIII.\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nQuestion 1\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its Question 1, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a02(2)(d) and Article\u00a023 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that that regulation applies to the processing of personal data envisaged by national legislation intended to transpose, into domestic law, the provisions of the PNR Directive, those of the API Directive and also those of Directive 2010/65, in particular, the transfer, the retention and the processing of PNR data.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from Article\u00a02(1) of the GDPR, that regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of such data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system. The concept of \u2018processing\u2019 is defined in broad terms in Article\u00a04(2) of that regulation as including, inter alia, collection, recording, storage, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or erasure of such data or sets of data.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Belgian Government submits however that the transfer of PNR data by economic operators to the PIU, for the purposes of the prevention and detection of criminal offences, as provided for in Article\u00a01(1)(a) and (2) and Article\u00a08 of the PNR Directive, which constitutes \u2018processing\u2019 of personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR, as well as the advance collection thereof, fall outside the scope of Article\u00a02(2)(d) of the said regulation, on the ground that the case-law stemming from the judgment of 30\u00a0May 2006, Parliament v Council and Commission, C-317/04 and C-318/04, EU:C:2006:346 (paragraphs\u00a057 to 59), relating to the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, is applicable to that provision of the regulation.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is true that, as previously held by the Court, the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, which was repealed and replaced by the GDPR with effect from 25\u00a0May 2018, generally excluded from its scope \u2018processing operations concerning public security, defence [and] State security\u2019, without drawing any distinction according the person carrying out the data processing operation concerned. Thus, processing operations carried out by private operators resulting from obligations imposed by the public authorities could, where appropriate, fall within the scope of the exception laid down in that provision, given that the wording of that provision covered all processing operations concerning public security, defence or State security, regardless of the person carrying out those operations (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, La Quadrature du Net and Others, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0101).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Article\u00a02(2)(d) of the GDPR draws such a distinction, since, as noted by the Advocate General in points\u00a041 and 46 of his Opinion, it is clearly apparent from the wording of that provision that two conditions need to be met for data processing to fall within the scope of the exception it lays down. While the first one of those conditions related to the purposes of the processing operation, namely, the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, the second condition relates to the person carrying out that operation, namely a \u2018competent authority\u2019 within the meaning of that provision.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has also held, it is apparent from Article\u00a023(1)(d) and (h) of the GDPR that the processing of personal data carried out by individuals for the purposes set out in Article\u00a02(2)(d) of that regulation falls within the scope of thereof (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, La Quadrature du Net and Others, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0102).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the case-law stemming from the judgment of 30\u00a0May 2006, Parliament v Council and Commission (C-317/04 and C-318/04, EU:C:2006:346), relied on by the Belgian Government, is not applicable to the exception to the scope of the GDPR set out in Article\u00a02(2)(d) thereof.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, that exception, like the other exceptions to the scope of the GDPR laid down in Article\u00a02(2) of that regulation, must be interpreted strictly.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from recital\u00a019 of the GDPR, the reason for that exception is that the processing of personal data by authorities competent for the purposes, inter alia, of the prevention and detection of criminal offences, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security is governed by a more specific EU legal act, namely Directive 2016/680, which was adopted on the same day as the GDPR (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a069).\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is stated, moreover, in recitals\u00a09 to 11 of Directive 2016/680, the latter lays down the specific rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to such processing operations, respecting the specific nature of those activities in the fields of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation, while the GDPR defines general rules concerning the protection of those persons which are intended to apply to those processing operations when Directive 2016/680, as a more specific legal act, does not apply. In particular, according to recital\u00a011 of that directive, the GDPR applies to processing of personal data that is carried out by a \u2018competent authority\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a03(7) of the said directive, but for purposes other than those of that directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a070).\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the first condition set out in paragraph\u00a067 above, and, specifically, the purposes for which the personal data are to be processed under the PNR Directive, it is appropriate to recall that, in accordance with Article\u00a01(2) of that directive, PNR data may be processed only for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. Those purposes are covered by those set out in Article\u00a02(2)(d) of the GDPR and Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, with the result that such processing operations may be caught by the exception laid down in Article\u00a02(2)(d) of that regulation and, consequently, be within the scope of that directive.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, that is not the case with regard to the processing operations covered by the API Directive and Directive 2010/65, the purposes of which are other than those in Article\u00a02(2)(d) of the GDPR and Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the API Directive aims at improving border controls and combating illegal immigration, as is apparent from recitals\u00a01, 7 and 9 as well as Article\u00a01 thereof, by the transmission of advance passenger data by carriers to the competent national authorities. Moreover, several recitals and provisions of that directive make clear that the data processing operations envisaged for its implementation are within the scope of the GDPR. Recital\u00a012 of that directive states that \u2018Directive [95/46] applies with regard to the processing of personal data by the authorities of the Member States\u2019. In addition, the fifth subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the API Directive specifies that Member States may also use API data for law enforcement purposes, \u2018subject to data protection provisions under Directive [95/46]\u2019, that phrase being used also in the third subparagraph of that provision. Similarly, the phrase \u2018without prejudice to the provisions of Directive [95/46]\u2019 is used, inter alia, in recital\u00a09 of the API Directive. Article\u00a06(2) of the API Directive provides, lastly, that passengers must be informed by carriers \u2018in accordance with the provisions laid down in Directive [95/46]\u2019.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to Directive 2010/65, it follows from recital\u00a02 and Article\u00a01(1) thereof that the purpose of that directive is to simplify and harmonise the administrative procedures applied to maritime transport by making the electronic transmission of information standard and by rationalising reporting formalities, for the facilitation of maritime transport, and in order to reduce the administrative burden for shipping companies. Article\u00a08(2) of the said directive confirms that the data processing operations envisaged for its implementation fall within the scope of the GDPR, since that provision require Member States, concerning personal data, to ensure compliance with Directive 95/46.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the data processing operations envisaged by national legislation transposing, into domestic law, the provisions of the API Directive and of Directive 2010/65 are within the scope of the GDPR. By contrast, data processing operations envisaged by national legislation that transpose, into domestic law, the PNR Directive may, pursuant to the exception in Article\u00a02(2)(d) of that regulation, fall outside the scope of the regulation, subject to compliance with the second condition recalled in paragraph\u00a067 above, namely that the person carrying out the processing operations is a competent authority within the meaning of the latter provision.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards that second condition, the Court has held that, in so far as Directive 2016/680 defines, in Article\u00a03(7) thereof, the concept of \u2018competent authority\u2019, such a definition must be applied, by analogy, to Article\u00a02(2)(d) of the GDPR (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a069).\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Articles\u00a04 and 7 of the PNR Directive, each Member State must, respectively, designate, as its PIU, an authority competent for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of terrorist offences and of serious crime and adopt a list of the competent authorities entitled to request or receive PNR data or the result of processing those data from the PIU, the latter authorities being also competent for those purposes, as specified in Article\u00a07(2) of that directive.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows therefrom that the processing of PNR data by the PIU and the said competent authorities for such purposes satisfy both conditions referred to in paragraph\u00a067 above, with the result that those operations are covered by the provisions of the PNR Directive itself as well as those of Directive 2016/680 and not those of the GDPR, as confirmed, moreover, by recital\u00a027 of the PNR Directive.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, since economic operators such as air carriers, although they have a legal obligation to transfer PNR data, are neither in charge of exercising public authority nor entrusted with public powers by that directive, they cannot be regarded as being competent authorities within the meaning of Article\u00a03(7) of Directive 2016/680 and Article\u00a02(2)(d) of the GDPR, with the result that the collection of those data and transfer to the PIU, by air carriers, are covered by that regulation. The same applies in a situation, such as that provided for by the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016, where the collection and transfer of the said data are operated by other carriers or by tour operators.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring, lastly, raises the question of the impact, if any, of the adoption of national legislation intended to transpose the provisions of the PNR Directive, those of the API Directive and also those of Directive 2010/65, such as the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016. In that regard, it should be borne in mind that, as is apparent from paragraphs\u00a072 and 75 to 77 above, the data processing operations provided for under those last two directives fall within the scope of the GDPR, which entails general rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, when a data processing operation carried out on the basis of that legislation is covered by the API Directive and/or Directive 2010/65, the GDPR applies to that operation. The same is true of a data processing operation carried out on that same basis and, in terms of its purpose and in addition to the PNR Directive, falls within the API Directive and/or Directive 2010/65. Lastly, when a data processing operation carried out on the basis of that same legislation, in terms of its purpose, falls outside the PNR Directive, the GDPR applies if the operation relates to the collection of PNR data and transfer to the PIU, by air carriers. By contrast, where such a processing operation is carried out by the PIU or the authorities competent for the purposes referred to in Article\u00a01(2) of the PNR Directive, that operation is covered by Directive 2016/680, in addition to national law.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Question 1 is that Article\u00a02(2)(d) and Article\u00a023 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that that regulation applies to the processing of personal data envisaged by national legislation intended to transpose, into domestic law, the provisions of the API Directive, those of Directive 2010/65 and also those of the PNR Directive in respect of, on the one hand, data processing operations carried out by private operators and, on the other hand, data processing operations carried out by public authorities covered, solely or in addition, by the API Directive or Directive 2010/65. By contrast, the said regulation does not apply to the data processing operations envisaged by such legislation which are covered only by the PNR Directive and are carried out by the PIU or by the authorities competent for the purposes referred to in Article\u00a01(2) of that directive.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nQuestions 2 to 4 and Question 6\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its Questions 2 to 4 and Question 6, which it is appropriate to consider together, the referring court asks the Court, in essence, whether the PNR Directive is valid in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter. Those questions concern, inter alia:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Annex\u00a0I to that directive and the data listed in that annex, in particular those referred to in paragraphs\u00a012 and 18 thereof, concerning the requirements for clarity and precision (Questions 2 and 3);\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03(4) of the said directive and Annex\u00a0I thereto, in that the system of generalised collection, transfer and processing of PNR data established by those provisions may apply to any person on a flight covered by the provisions of that directive (Question 4), and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06 of the PNR Directive in that it provides for advance assessment, by comparing PNR data against databases and/or processing them against pre-determined criteria, which applies to such data in a systematic and generalised manner, regardless of whether there is any objective ground for considering that the passengers concerned may present a risk to public security (Question 6).\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted as a preliminary point that, in accordance with a general principle of interpretation, an EU act must be interpreted, as far as possible, in such a way as not to affect its validity and in conformity with primary law as a whole and, in particular, with the provisions of the Charter Thus, if the wording of secondary EU legislation is open to more than one interpretation, preference should be given to the interpretation which renders the provision consistent with primary law rather than to the interpretation which leads to its being incompatible with primary law (judgment of 2\u00a0February 2021, \nConsob\n, C-481/19, EU:C:2021:84, paragraph\u00a050 and the case-law cited).\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it is settled case-law that, when a directive allows the Member States discretion to define transposition measures adapted to the various situations possible, they must, when implementing those measures, not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with the directive in question but also ensure that they do not rely on an interpretation of the directive that would be in conflict with the fundamental rights protected by the EU legal order or with the other general principles recognised by EU law (see, to that effect, judgments of 15\u00a0February 2016, \nN.\n, C-601/15\u00a0PPU, EU:C:2016:84, paragraph\u00a060 and the case-law cited, and of 16\u00a0July 2020, \n\u00c9tat belge (Family reunification\n\u00a0\u2013 Minor child)\n, C-133/19, C-136/19 and C-137/19, EU:C:2020:577, paragraph\u00a033 and the case-law cited).\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the PNR Directive, it should be noted that recitals\u00a015, 20, 22, 25, 36 and 37 thereof stress the importance that the EU legislature, by referring to the high level of data protection, gives to the full respect for fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07, 8 and 21 of the Charter as well as the principle of proportionality, with the result that, as stated in recital\u00a036, that directive \u2018should\u00a0\u2026 be implemented accordingly\u2019.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, recital\u00a022 of the PNR Directive points out that, \u2018[by] taking fully into consideration the principles outlined in recent relevant case-law of the [Court], the application of th[at] Directive should ensure full respect for fundamental rights, for the right to privacy and for the principle of proportionality\u2019 and \u2018genuinely meet the objectives of necessity and proportionality in order to achieve the general interests recognised by the [European] Union and the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others in the fight against terrorist offences and serious crime\u2019. That recital adds that that application \u2018should be duly justified and the necessary safeguards put in place to ensure the lawfulness of any storage, analysis, transfer or use of PNR data\u2019.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, under Article\u00a019(2) of the PNR Directive, the Commission, when reviewing the directive, must pay special attention to \u2018compliance with the applicable standards of protection of personal data\u2019, \u2018the necessity and proportionality of collecting and processing PNR data for each of the purposes set out in this Directive\u2019 and \u2018the length of the data retention period\u2019.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is therefore appropriate to determine whether the PNR Directive, in accordance with, in particular, the requirements set out in its recitals and its provisions referred to in paragraphs\u00a088 to 90 above, may be interpreted in a way that ensures full respect for the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter as well as the principle of proportionality enshrined in Article\u00a052(1) thereof.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nInterferences with the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter resulting from the PNR Directive\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a07 of the Charter guarantees everyone the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications, while Article\u00a08(1) of the Charter expressly confers on everyone the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from Article\u00a03(5) of the PNR Directive and the list in Annex\u00a0I thereto, the PNR data covered by that directive include, inter alia, besides the name(s) of the air passenger(s), information necessary to the reservation, such as the dates of intended travel and the travel itinerary, information relating to tickets, groups of persons checked-in under the same reservation number, passenger contact information, information relating to the means of payment or billing, information concerning baggage and general remarks regarding the passengers.\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the PNR data therefore include information on identified individuals, namely the air passengers concerned, the various forms of processing to which those data may be subject affect the fundamental right to respect for private life, guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the Charter (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0121 and 122 and the case-law cited).\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the processing of PNR data such as that covered by the PNR Directive also falls within the scope of Article\u00a08 of the Charter because it constitutes the processing of personal data within the meaning of that article and, accordingly, must necessarily satisfy the data protection requirements laid down in that article (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0123 and the case-law cited).\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is settled case-law that the communication of personal data to a third party, such as a public authority, constitutes an interference with the fundamental rights enshrined Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, whatever the subsequent use of the information communicated. The same is true of the retention of personal data and access to those data with a view to their use by public authorities. In this connection, it does not matter whether the information in question relating to private life is sensitive or whether the persons concerned have been inconvenienced in any way on account of that interference (Opinion 1/15, \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0124 and 126 and the case-law cited).\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, both the transfer of PNR data by air carriers to the PIU of the Member State concerned, provided for in Article\u00a01(1)(a) of the PNR Directive, read in conjunction with Article\u00a08 thereof, and the framework of conditions governing the retention of those data, their use and any further transfer to the competent authorities of that Member State, to the PIUs and the competent authorities of the other Member States, to Europol or to the authorities of third countries, which are permitted, inter alia, by Articles\u00a06, 7, 9 and 10 to 12 of that directive, constitute interferences with the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the seriousness of those interferences, it should be noted, first, that according to Article\u00a01(1)(a), read in conjunction with Article\u00a08 thereof, the PNR Directive provides for the systematic and continuous transfer to the PIUs of PNR data relating to any air passenger on an extra-EU flight within the meaning of Article\u00a03(2) of that directive, operated between third countries and the European Union. As noted by the Advocate General in point\u00a073 of his Opinion, such a transfer involves general and full access, by the PIUs, to the PNR data disclosed, concerning all the persons using air transport services, irrespective of subsequent use of those data.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, Article\u00a02 of the PNR Directive provides, in paragraph\u00a01 thereof, that Member States may decide to apply the directive to intra-EU flights within the meaning of Article\u00a03(3) thereof, and specifies, in paragraph\u00a02 thereof, that in that case all the provisions of the said directive \u2018shall apply to intra-EU flights as if they were extra-EU flights and to PNR data from intra-EU flights as if they were PNR data from extra-EU flights\u2019.\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, even if some of the PNR data listed on Annex\u00a0I to the PNR Directive, as summarised in paragraph\u00a093 above, taken in isolation, do not appear to be liable to reveal precise information about the private life of the persons concerned, the fact remains that, taken as a whole, the data may, inter alia, reveal a complete travel itinerary, travel habits, relationships existing between one or more persons and the financial situation of air passengers, their dietary habits or state of health, and may even reveal sensitive information about those passengers (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0128).\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourthly, under Article\u00a06(2)(a) and (b) of the PNR Directive, the data transferred by air carriers are intended for advance assessment, prior to the passengers\u2019 scheduled arrival or departure, as well as subsequent \n\u00a0\nassessment.\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards advance assessment, it is apparent from Article\u00a06(2)(a) and (3) of the PNR Directive that that assessment is carried out by the PIUs of the Member States, systematically and by automated means, that is to say continuously and regardless of whether there is any indication that there is a risk that the person concerned is involved in terrorist offences or serious crime. To that end, those provisions provide that PNR data may be compared against \u2018relevant databases\u2019 and be processed against \u2018pre-determined\u2019 criteria.\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against this background, it should be borne in mind that the Court has already held that the extent of the interference which automated analyses of PNR data entail in respect of the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter essentially depends on the pre-determined models and criteria and on the databases on which that type of data processing is based (Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0172).\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted by the Advocate General in point\u00a078 of his Opinion, the processing operation provided for in Article\u00a06(3)(a) of the PNR Directive, namely the comparison of PNR data against \u2018relevant databases\u2019, may provide additional information on the private lives of air passengers and may allow very precise conclusions to be drawn in that regard.\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the processing of PNR data against \u2018pre-determined criteria\u2019 provided for in Article\u00a06(3)(b) of the PNR Directive, it is true that Article\u00a06(4) of that directive requires that any assessment of passengers by those means must be carried out in a non-discriminatory manner and, in particular, should not be based on a series of characteristics referred to in the last sentence of that paragraph\u00a04. In addition, the criteria used must be targeted, proportionate and specific.\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being said, the Court has already held that, since automated analyses of PNR data are carried out on the basis of unverified personal data and are based on pre-determined models and criteria, they necessarily present some margin of error (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) \nof 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0169). In particular, as noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in point\u00a078 of his Opinion, it is apparent from Commission Working Document (SWD(2020) 128 final) annexed to its report of 24\u00a0July 2020 on the review of the PNR Directive that the number of positive matches from automated processing under Article\u00a06(3)(a) and (b) of that directive which prove to be incorrect following individual review by non-automated means is fairly substantial, amounting in 2018 and 2019 to at least five out of six individuals identified. Those processing operations thus lead to a careful analysis of the PNR data relating to the said persons.\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the subsequent assessment of PNR data provided for in Article\u00a06(2)(b) of the PNR Directive, it is apparent from that provision that, during the period of six months after the transfer of the PNR data, referred to in Article\u00a012(2) of that directive, the PIU is required, upon request from the competent authorities, to provide them with the PNR data and process those data in specific cases, for the purposes of combating terrorist offences and serious crime.\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, even if, upon expiry of that period of six months, PNR data are depersonalised through masking out of certain data elements, the PIU may be required, pursuant to Article\u00a012(3) of the PNR Directive, to disclose, following such a request, full PNR data in a form which permits the identification of the data subject by the competent authorities where it is reasonably believed that it is necessary for the purposes referred to Article\u00a06(2)(b) of that directive, such disclosure being however subject to approval granted by a judicial authority or \u2018another [competent] national authority\u2019.\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fifthly, by providing, in Article\u00a012(1) thereof, without providing further details in that regard, that PNR data are to be retained in a database for a period of five years following their transfer to the PIU of the Member State on the territory of which the flight is landing or departing, the PNR Directive, given the fact that, despite being depersonalised upon expiry of the initial period of six months though masking out of certain data elements, full PNR data may still be disclosed in the scenario referred to in the preceding paragraph, makes it possible for information on the private life of air passengers to be available for a period of time which the Court, in its Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) \nof 26\u00a0July 2017 (EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0132), has already described as being particularly long.\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given how common use of air transport services is, the effect of a retention period that long is that a very large part of the population of the European Union is liable to have its PNR data retained, repeatedly, under the system established by the PNR Directive and, accordingly, be accessible for analyses carried out in the context of advance and subsequent assessments by the PIU and competent authorities over a considerable\u00a0\u2013 even indefinite\u00a0\u2013 period of time, in the case of persons who travel by air more than once every five years.\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all of the foregoing, it is appropriate to find that the PNR Directive entails undeniably serious interferences with the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, in so far, inter alia, as it seeks to introduce a surveillance regime that is continuous, untargeted and systematic, including the automated assessment of the personal data of everyone using air transport services.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nJustification for the interferences resulting from the PNR Directive\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be borne in mind that the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society (Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) \nof 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0136 and the case-law cited, and judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nPrivacy International\n, C-623/17, EU:C:2020:790, paragraph\u00a063 and the case-law cited).\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the first sentence of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by the Charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. Under the second sentence of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made to those rights and freedoms only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others. In this connection, Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter states that personal data must, inter alia, be processed \u2018for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law\u2019.\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be added that the requirement that any limitation on the exercise of fundamental rights must be provided for by law implies that the act which permits the interference with those rights must itself define the scope of the limitation on the exercise of the right concerned, bearing in mind, on the one hand, that that requirement does not preclude the limitation in question from being formulated in terms which are sufficiently open to be able to adapt to different scenarios and keep pace with changing circumstances (see, to that effect, judgment of 26\u00a0April 2022, \nPoland\n v \nParliament and Council\n, C-401/19, EU:C:2022:297, paragraphs\u00a064 and 74 and the case-law cited) and, on the other hand, that the Court may, where appropriate, specify, by means of interpretation, the actual scope of the limitation in the light of the very wording of the EU legislation in question as well as its general scheme and the objectives it pursues, as interpreted in view of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter.\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards observance of the principle of proportionality, the protection of the fundamental right to respect for private life at EU level requires, in accordance with settled case-law of the Court, that derogations from and limitations on the protection of personal data should apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. In addition, an objective of general interest may not be pursued without having regard to the fact that it must be reconciled with the fundamental rights affected by the measure, by properly balancing the objective of general interest against the rights at issue (Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) \nof 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0140, and judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others,\n C-140/20, \nEU:C:2022:258\n, paragraph\u00a052 and the case-law cited).\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, the question whether the Member States may justify a limitation on the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter must be assessed by measuring the seriousness of the interference which such a limitation entails and by verifying that the importance of the objective of general interest pursued by that limitation is proportionate to that seriousness (see, to that effect, judgments of 2\u00a0October 2018, Ministerio Fiscal, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraph\u00a055 and the case-law cited, and of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a053 and the case-law cited).\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to satisfy the proportionality requirement, the legislation in question entailing the interference must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measures provided for and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose data have been transferred have sufficient guarantees to protect effectively their personal data against the risk of abuse. It must, in particular, indicate in what circumstances and under which conditions a measure providing for the processing of such data may be adopted, thereby ensuring that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data are subject to automated processing. Those considerations apply especially where the PNR data are liable to reveal sensitive passenger data (Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) \nof 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0141, and judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0132 and the case-law cited).\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, legislation that provides for the retention of personal data must continue to satisfy objective criteria that establish a connection between the data to be retained and the objective pursued (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) \nof 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0191 and the case-law cited, and judgments of 3\u00a0October 2019, \nA and Others\n, C-70/18, EU:C:2019:823, paragraph\u00a063, and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0133).\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nObservance of the principle of legality and respect for the essence of the fundamental rights in question\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Provision is made in an EU legislative act for the limitation of the exercise of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter stemming from the system established by the PNR Directive. As to the question whether, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraph\u00a0114 above, that directive, as an act of EU law which permits interference with those rights, itself defines the scope of the limitation on the exercise of the rights concerned, it must be noted that the provisions of the said directive as well as Annexes\u00a0I and II thereto, first, list PNR data and, secondly, provide a framework for processing those data, inter alia, by laying down the purposes and detailed rules governing those processing operations. Moreover that question is largely the same as that of compliance with the proportionality requirement referred to in paragraph\u00a0117 above (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, Facebook Ireland and Schrems, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0180), and will be examined in paragraph\u00a0125 et seq. below.\n120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards respect for the essence of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, it is true that PNR data may, in some circumstances, reveal very specific information on the private life of a person. However, in so far as, on the one hand, the nature of that information is limited to certain aspects of a person\u2019s private life, concerning that person\u2019s air travel in particular, and, on the other hand, the PNR Directive expressly prohibits in Article\u00a013(4) thereof the processing of sensitive data within the meaning of Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR, the data covered by that directive do not by themselves allow for a full overview of the private life of a person. In addition, that directive, in Article\u00a01(2) thereof read in conjunction with Article\u00a03(8) and (9) thereof as well as Annex\u00a0II thereto, circumscribes the purposes for which those data are to be processed. Lastly, that same directive, in Articles\u00a04 to 15 thereof, lays down the rules governing the transfer, processing and retention of those data as well as the rules intended to ensure, inter alia, the security, confidentiality and integrity of those data, and to protect them against unlawful access and processing. In those circumstances, the interferences which the PNR Directive entails do not adversely affect the essence of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nObjective of general interest and appropriateness of the processing of PNR data having regard to that objective\n121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the question whether the system established by the PNR Directive pursues an objective of general interest, it is apparent from recitals\u00a05, 6 and 15 of that directive that the objectives thereof are to ensure the internal security of the European Union and thus protect the life and safety of persons, while creating a legal framework that guarantees a high level of protection of passengers\u2019 fundamental rights, in particular the right to the respect for private life and that of the protection of personal data, where PNR data are processed by the competent authorities.\n122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, Article\u00a01(2) of the PNR Directive provides that PNR data collected in accordance with that directive may be subject to the processing operations referred to in Article\u00a06(2)(a) to (c) thereof only for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. Those purposes undoubtedly constitute objectives of general interest of the European Union that are capable of justifying even serious interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 8\u00a0April 2014, Digital Rights Ireland and Others, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a042, and Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, \nEU:C:2017:592\n, paragraphs\u00a0148 and 149).\n123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the whether the system established by the PNR Directive is appropriate for the purpose of attaining the objectives pursued, it should be noted that while the possibility of \u2018false negatives\u2019 and the fairly substantial number of \u2018false positives\u2019 resulting, as noted in paragraph\u00a0106 above, from automated processing under that directive in 2018 and 2019, are liable to limit the appropriateness of that system, they are not capable, however, of rendering the said system inappropriate for the purpose of contributing to the attainment of the objective of combating terrorist offences and serious crime. As is apparent from the Commission working document referred to in paragraph\u00a0106 above, automated processing carried out under the said directive have indeed already made it possible to identify air passengers presenting a risk in the context of the fight against terrorist offences and serious crime.\n124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, having regard to the margin of error inherent in the automated processing of PNR data and, in particular, the fairly substantial number of \u2018false positives\u2019, the appropriateness of the system established by the PNR Directive essentially depends on the proper functioning of the subsequent verification of the results obtained under those processing operations, by non-automated means, which, pursuant to that directive, is task for the PIU. The provisions laid down to that effect by the said directive thus contribute to the attainment of those objectives.\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhether the interferences from the PNR Directive are necessary\n125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the case-law recalled in paragraphs\u00a0115 to 118 above, it must be determined whether the interferences resulting from the PNR Directive are limited to what is strictly necessary and, inter alia, whether that directive lays down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measures provided for and whether the system it establishes continues to meet objective criteria that establish a connection between PNR data, closely linked to booking for and engaging in air travel, and the objectives pursued by that directive, namely the fight against terrorist offences and serious crime.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAir passenger data covered by the PNR Directive\n126\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is necessary to assess whether the data headings in Annex\u00a0I to the PNR Directive define in a clear and precise manner the PNR data which air carriers are required to provide to the PIU.\n127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it must be recalled that, as is apparent from recital\u00a015 of the PNR Directive, the EU legislature intended for the list of the PNR data to be obtained by a PIU to be drawn up \u2018with the objective of reflecting the legitimate requirements of public authorities to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist offences or serious crime, thereby improving internal security within the [European] Union as well as protecting the fundamental rights, in particular privacy and the protection of personal data\u2019. In particular, under that same recital, those data \u2018should only contain details of passengers\u2019 reservations and travel itineraries that enable competent authorities to identify air passengers representing a threat to internal security\u2019. In addition, the PNR Directive prohibits, in the first sentence of Article\u00a013(4) thereof, \u2018the processing of PNR data revealing a person\u2019s race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, sexual life or sexual orientation\u2019.\n128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, PNR data collected and provided in accordance with Annex\u00a0I to the PNR Directive must relate directly to the flight operated and the passenger concerned and must be limited in such a way as to, on the one hand, meet solely the legitimate requirements of public authorities to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist offences or serious crime and, on the other, exclude sensitive data. \n129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Headings\u00a01 to 4, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17 and 19 of Annex\u00a0I to the PNR Directive meet those requirements as well as those of clarity and precision, in that they concern clearly identifiable and circumscribed information directly related to the flight operated and the passenger concerned. As noted by the Advocate General in point\u00a0165 of his Opinion, the same is true of headings\u00a010, 13, 14 and 16, despite their \u2018open-ended\u2019 wording. \n130\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, clarifications are needed for the purposes of interpreting headings\u00a05, 6, 8, 12 and 18.\n131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heading\u00a05, entitled \u2018address and contact information (telephone number, email address)\u2019, does not expressly specify whether the said address and contact information refer to the air passenger alone or also cover third parties who made the flight reservation for the air passenger, third parties through whom an air passenger may be contacted, or indeed third parties who are to be informed in the event of an emergency. However, as noted by the Advocate General, in essence, in point\u00a0162 of his Opinion, given the requirements of clarity and precision, that heading cannot be interpreted as allowing, implicitly, also the collection and transfer of personal data of such third parties. Consequently, that heading should be interpreted as referring only to the postal address and contact information, namely the telephone number and email address, of the air passenger on behalf of whom the reservation is made. \n132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to heading\u00a06, which relates to \u2018all forms of payment information, including billing address\u2019, that heading, in order to meet the requirements of clarity and precision, must be interpreted as covering solely information relating to the payment methods for, and billing of, the air ticket, to the exclusion of any other information not directly relating to the flight (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0159).\n133\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heading\u00a08, which relates to \u2018frequent flyer information\u2019, must be interpreted, as noted by the Advocate General in point\u00a0164 of his Opinion, as referring exclusively to data relating to the status of the passenger concerned in the context of a customer loyalty programme of a given airline or a given group of airlines as well as the number identifying that passenger as a \u2018frequent flyer\u2019. Heading\u00a08 thus does not permit the collection of information relating to transactions through which that status was acquired.\n134\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heading\u00a012 concerns \u2018general remarks (including all available information on unaccompanied minors under 18\u00a0years, such as name and gender of the minor, age, language(s) spoken, name and contact details of guardian on departure and relationship to the minor, name and contact details of guardian on arrival and relationship to the minor, departure and arrival agent)\u2019.\n135\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be noted from the outset that whereas the phrase \u2018general remarks\u2019 does not meet the requirements of clarity and precision in that it does not set, as such, any limitation on the nature and scope of the information that may be collected and provided to a PIU under heading\u00a012 (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0160), the list in brackets does.\n136\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, in order to interpret heading\u00a012, in accordance with the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a086 above, in a manner that complies with the requirements of clarity and precision and, more generally, with Articles\u00a07 and 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, it is appropriate to consider that only the collection and provision of information expressly listed under that heading are allowed, namely the name and gender of minor air passengers, their age, language(s) spoken, the name and contact details of the guardian on departure and relationship to the minor, the name and contact details of the guardian on arrival and relationship to the minor, departure and arrival agent.\n137\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, heading\u00a018 refers to \u2018any advance passenger information (API) data collected (including the type, number, country of issuance and expiry date of any identity document, nationality, family name, given name, gender, date of birth, airline, flight number, departure date, arrival date, departure port, arrival port, departure time and arrival time)\u2019.\n138\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted, in essence, by the Advocate General, in points\u00a0156 to 160 of his Opinion, it is apparent from that heading\u00a018, read in the light of recitals\u00a04 and 9 of the PNR Directive, that the information to which it refers is exhaustively the API data listed in the said heading as well as in Article\u00a03(2) of the API Directive.\n139\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus heading\u00a018, in so far as it is construed as covering only the information expressly referred to in that heading and in Article\u00a03(2) of the API Directive, may be regarded as meeting the requirements of clarity and precision (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0161).\n140\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it must be held that, interpreted in accordance with the considerations set out inter alia in paragraphs\u00a0130 to 139 above, Annex\u00a0I to the PNR Directive is of a sufficiently clear and precise nature overall, thus defining the scope of the interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe purposes for which PNR data may be processed\n141\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from Article\u00a01(2) of the PNR Directive, the PNR data collected in accordance with that directive are to be processed for the purposes of combating \u2018terrorist offences\u2019 and \u2018serious crime\u2019.\n142\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to whether the PNR Directive provides, in that context, for clear and precise rules that limit the application of the system established by that directive to what is strictly necessary for those purposes, it should be borne in mind, first, that the phrase \u2018terrorist offences\u2019 is defined in Article\u00a03(8) of the said directive by reference to the \u2018offences under national law referred to in Articles\u00a01 to 4 of Framework Decision [2002/475]\u2019.\n143\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the fact that that framework decision, in Articles\u00a01 to 3 thereof, defined in a clear and precise manner \u2018terrorist offences\u2019, \u2018offences related to a terrorist group\u2019 and \u2018offences related to terrorist activities\u2019, which Member States had to ensure were made punishable as criminal offences under that framework decision, Directive 2017/541, in Articles\u00a03 to 14 thereof, also defines those same offences in a clear and precise manner.\n144\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, Article\u00a03(9) of the PNR Directive defines \u2018serious crime\u2019 by reference to the \u2018offences listed in Annex\u00a0II [to that directive] that are punishable by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years under the national law of a Member State\u2019.\n145\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, first of all, that annex lists exhaustively the different categories of offences that might be covered by the notion of \u2018serious crime\u2019 referred to in Article\u00a03(9) of the PNR Directive.\n146\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, having regard to the particular features, at the time that directive was adopted, of the criminal justice systems of the Member States in the absence of harmonisation of the offences thus referred to, it was possible for the EU legislature merely to refer to categories of offences without defining the constitutive elements thereof, especially since those elements are necessarily defined under the national law to which Article\u00a03(9) of the PNR Directive refers, in that Member States are bound by the respect for the principle of legality of criminal offences and penalties as a component of the common value, shared with the European Union, of the rule of law under Article\u00a02 TEU (see, by analogy, judgment of 16\u00a0February 2022, \nHungary\n v \nParliament and Council\n, C-156/21, EU:C:2022:97, paragraphs\u00a0136, 160 and 234), which principle is, moreover, is enshrined in Article\u00a049(1) of the Charter, which Member States are required to observe when they implement an EU measure such as the PNR Directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 10\u00a0November 2011, \nQB\n, C-405/10, EU:C:2011:722, paragraph\u00a048 and the case-law cited). Thus, in the light of the usual meaning of the terms used in that annex, it must be found that the said annex determines, in a sufficiently clear and precise manner, the offences that may constitute serious crime. \n147\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that paragraphs\u00a07, 8, 10 and 16 of Annex\u00a0II relate to categories of offences that are very general (fraud, laundering of the proceeds of crime and counterfeiting of currency, environmental crime, illicit trafficking in cultural goods) while nonetheless referring to specific offences falling within those general categories. In order to ensure the requisite level of precision under Article\u00a049 of the Charter also, those paragraphs must be interpreted as referring to the said offences, as defined in the relevant area of national and/or EU law. When interpreted that way those paragraphs can be regarded as meeting the requirements of clarity and precision. \n148\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, it is important also to bear in mind that, although, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, the objective of combating serious crime is capable of justifying the serious interference with the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter which the PNR Directive entails, the same is not true of the objective of combating criminality in general, since the latter objective may justify solely non-serious interferences (see, by analogy, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a059 and the case-law cited). Thus, that directive must ensure, by means of clear and precise rules, that the application of the system established by the said directive is limited to offences amounting to serious crime and thereby excludes those amounting to ordinary crime. \n149\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as noted by the Advocate General in point\u00a0121 of his Opinion, many of the offences listed in Annex\u00a0II to the PNR Directive\u00a0\u2013 such as human trafficking, the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, illicit trafficking in weapons munitions and explosives, money laundering, cybercrime, illicit trade in human organs and tissue, illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, illicit trafficking in nuclear or radioactive materials, unlawful seizure of aircraft/ships, serious crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, murder, rape, kidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage-taking\u00a0\u2013 are inherently and indisputably extremely serious.\n150\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, although other offences, also referred to in that Annex\u00a0II, are less likely, a priori, to be associated with serious crime, it is nevertheless apparent from Article\u00a03(9) of the PNR Directive that those offences may be considered to amount to serious crime only if they are punishable by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years under the national law of the Member State concerned. The requirements flowing from that provision, which relate to the nature and severity of the penalty applicable, are, in principle, such as to limit the application of the system established by that directive to offences that have the requisite level of seriousness to justify the interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter stemming from the system established by the said directive.\n151\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nonetheless, since Article\u00a03(9) of the PNR Directive refers to the maximum rather than the minimum penalty applicable, it cannot be ruled out that PNR data may be processed for the purposes of combating offences which, although meeting the criterion laid down by that provision relating to the threshold of severity, amount to ordinary crime rather than serious crime, having regard to the particular features of the domestic criminal justice system.\n152\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is thus for the Member States to ensure that the application of the system established by the PNR Directive is effectively limited to combating serious crime and that that system does not extend to offences that amount to ordinary crime. \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe link between PNR data and the purposes for which those data are processed\n153\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, as noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in point\u00a0119 of his Opinion, the wording of Article\u00a03(8) and Article\u00a03(9) of the PNR Directive, read in conjunction with Annex\u00a0II thereto, does not expressly refer to a criterion that is capable of confining the scope of that directive solely to offences that may, by their nature, have an objective link, even if only indirect one, with air travel and, therefore, with the categories of data transferred, processed and retained pursuant to that directive.\n154\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, as pointed out by the Advocate General in point\u00a0121 of his Opinion, certain offences listed in Annex\u00a0II to the PNR Directive, such as human trafficking, illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs or weapons, facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence and the unlawful seizure of aircraft, are, by their very nature, likely to have a direct link with the carriage of passengers by air. The same is true of certain terrorist offences, such as causing extensive destruction to a transport system or an infrastructure facility or seizure of aircraft, offences under Article\u00a01(1)(d) and (e) of Framework Decision 2002/475, to which Article\u00a03(8) of the PNR Directive refers, or travelling for the purpose of terrorism and organising or otherwise facilitating such travelling, offences under Articles\u00a09 and 10 of Directive 2017/541.\n155\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against that background, it must also be borne in mind that the Commission provided reasons for its Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the use of Passenger Name Record data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime of 2\u00a0February 2011 (COM(2011) 32 final), which became the PNR Directive, emphasising the fact that \u2018the terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001, the aborted terrorist attack in August 2006 aimed at blowing up a number of aircraft on their way from the United Kingdom to the United States, and the attempted terrorist attack on board a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit in December 2009 showed the ability of terrorists to mount attacks, targeting international flights, in any country\u2019 and that \u2018most terrorist activities are transnational in character and involve international travel, inter alia to training camps outside the [European Union]\u2019. In addition, in order to justify the need for analysis of PNR data for the purposes of combating serious crime, the Commission referred, by way of example, to the case of a group of human traffickers who had used fake documents to check in for a flight as well as that of a human and drug trafficking network which, for the purposes of importing drugs to several destinations in Europe, had used persons who were themselves trafficked persons and had bought their air tickets with stolen credit cards. All of those cases concerned offences having a direct link with the carriage of passengers by air in that they were offences targeting the carriage of passengers by air as well as offences committed during or through travel by air.\n156\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it is important to note that even offences that have no such direct link with the carriage of passengers by air may, depending on the circumstances of the case, have an indirect link with the carriage of passengers by air. Such is the case, in particular, when air transport is used as a means of preparing such offences or evading criminal prosecution after committing such offences. By contrast, offences having no objective link, not even an indirect one, with the carriage of passengers by air cannot justify the application of the system established by the PNR Directive.\n157\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, Article\u00a03(8) and (9) of that directive, read in conjunction with Annex\u00a0II thereto and in the light of the requirements stemming from Articles\u00a07 and 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, requires Member States, in particular upon individual review by non-automated means as referred to in Article\u00a06(5) of that directive, to ensure that the application of the system established by it be limited to terrorist offences and serious crime having an objective link, even if only an indirect one, with the carriage of passengers by air. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe air passengers and flights concerned\n158\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The system established by the PNR Directive covers the PNR data of anyone who meets the definition of \u2018passenger\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a03(4) of that directive on a flight falling within the scope thereof. \n159\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Article\u00a08(1) of the said directive, those data are transferred to the PIU of the Member State on the territory of which the flight will land or from the territory of which the flight will depart, regardless of whether there is any objective evidence from which it may be inferred that the passengers concerned may present a risk of being involved in a terrorist offence or serious crime. The data thus transferred are, inter alia, processed by automated means in connection with the advance assessment under Article\u00a06(2)(a) and (3) of the PNR Directive, the objective of that assessment, as is apparent from recital\u00a07 of that directive, being the identification of persons who were not suspected of involvement in terrorist offences or serious crime prior to that assessment and who should be subject to further examination by the competent authorities.\n160\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specifically, it is apparent from Article\u00a01(1)(a) and Article\u00a02 of the PNR Directive that the latter distinguishes between passengers of extra-EU flights, operated between the European Union and third countries, and those of intra-EU flights, operated between different Member States.\n161\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards passengers of extra-EU flights, it must be recalled that, in respect of passengers flying between the European Union and Canada, the Court has already held that the automated processing of their PNR data, before their arrival in Canada, facilitates and expedites security checks, in particular at borders. Furthermore, the exclusion of certain categories of persons, or of certain areas of origin, would be liable to prevent the achievement of the objective of automated processing of PNR data, namely identifying, through verification of that data, persons liable to present a risk to public security from amongst all air passengers, and make it possible for that verification to be circumvented (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0187).\n162\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those considerations can be applied \nmutatis mutandis\n to the situation of passengers flying between the European Union and all third countries, whom Member States are required to subject to the system established by the PNR Directive pursuant to Article\u00a01(1)(a) of that directive, read in conjunction with Article\u00a03(2) and (4) of the said directive. The transfer and advance assessment of the PNR data of air passengers entering or leaving the European Union cannot be restricted to a particular group of air passengers, given the very nature of the threats to public security that may stem from terrorist offences and serious crime having an objective link, even if only an indirect one, with the carriage of passengers by air between the European Union and third countries. Thus, it must be found that the necessary connection between those data and the objective of combating such offences exists, with the result that the PNR Directive does not go beyond what is strictly necessary merely because it imposes on Member States the systematic transfer and advance assessment of the PNR data of all those passengers.\n163\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards passengers flying between different Member States of the European Union, Article\u00a02(1) of the PNR Directive, read in conjunction with recital\u00a010 thereof, provides only that Member States may extend the application of the system established by that directive to intra-EU flights.\n164\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the EU legislature did not intend to oblige Member States to extend the application of the system established by the PNR Directive to intra-EU flights but, as is apparent from Article\u00a019(3) of that directive, reserved its decision concerning such an extension, while taking the view that it should be preceded by a detailed assessment of the legal implications thereof, in particular for the fundamental rights of the data subjects. \n165\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, by stating that the Commission\u2019s review report referred to in Article\u00a019(1) of the PNR Directive must \u2018also include a review of the necessity, proportionality, and effectiveness of including within the scope of th[at] Directive the mandatory collection and transfer of PNR data relating to all or selected intra-EU flights\u2019 and that it must, in that regard, take into account \u2018the experience gained by Member States, especially those Member States that apply th[at] Directive to intra-EU flights in accordance with Article\u00a02\u2019, Article\u00a019(3) of that directive makes apparent that, for the EU legislature, the system established by the said directive must not necessarily extend to all intra-EU flights. \n166\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a similar vein, Article\u00a02(3) of the PNR Directive provides that Member States may decide to apply that directive only to selected intra-EU flights when they consider it necessary in order to pursue the objectives of the said directive, while being able to change the selected flights at any time.\n167\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, the Member States\u2019 power to extend the application of the system established by the PNR Directive to intra-EU flights is to be exercised, as is apparent from recital\u00a022 thereof, in full respect for the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter. In that regard, while, according to recital\u00a019 of the directive, it is for the Member States to assess the threats linked to terrorist offences and serious crime, the fact remains that the exercise of that power presupposes that, upon that assessment, Member States find that there is a threat related to those offences which is capable of justifying the application of the said directive to intra-EU flights also. \n168\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, a Member State, when it wishes to exercise the power provided for in Article\u00a02 of the PNR Directive, either for all intra-EU flights under paragraph\u00a02 of that article or only for such selected flights under paragraph\u00a03 of the said article, is not exempt from the requirement to verify that the extension of the application of that directive to selected or all intra-EU flights is effectively necessary and proportionate for the purposes of attaining the objective set out in Article\u00a01(2) of the said directive. \n169\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, given recitals\u00a05 to 7, 10 and 22 of the PNR Directive, the Member State must verify that the processing, under that directive, of the PNR data of passengers of intra-EU flights or selected such flights is strictly necessary, having regard to the seriousness of the interference with the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, in order to ensure the internal security of the European Union or, at least, that of that Member State and, thus, protect the life and safety of persons. \n170\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in particular, the threats related to terrorist offences, it is apparent from the Court\u2019s case-law that terrorist activities are amongst those capable of seriously destabilising the fundamental constitutional, political, economic or social structures of a country and, particularly, of directly threatening society, the population or the State itself, and that it is of paramount interest for each Member State to prevent and punish those activities to protect the essential functions of the State and the fundamental interests of society in order to safeguard national security. Such threats are distinguishable, by their nature, their particular seriousness and the specific nature of the circumstances of which they are constituted, from the general and permanent risk of serious criminal offences being committed (see, to that effect, judgments of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0135 and 136, and of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraphs\u00a061 and 62).\n171\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in a situation where it is established, on the basis of the assessment carried out by a Member State, that there are sufficiently solid grounds for considering that the latter is confronted with a terrorist threat which is shown to be genuine and present or foreseeable, the fact that that Member State makes provision for the application of the PNR Directive, pursuant to Article\u00a02(1) of that directive, to all intra-EU flights from or to the said Member State, for a limited period of time, does not appear to go beyond what is strictly necessary. The existence of that threat is, in itself, capable of establishing a connection between, on the one hand, the transfer and processing of the data concerned and, on the other, the fight against terrorism (see, by analogy, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0137).\n172\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision providing for that application must be open to effective review, either by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision is binding, in order to verify that that situation exists and that the conditions and safeguards which must be laid down are observed. The period of application must also be limited in time to what is strictly necessary but may be extended if that threat persists (see, by analogy, judgments of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0168, and of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a058).\n173\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, in the absence of a genuine and present or foreseeable terrorist threat with which the Member State concerned is confronted, the indiscriminate application by that Member State of the system established by the PNR Directive not only to extra-EU flights but also to all intra-EU flights would not be considered to be limited to what is strictly necessary. \n174\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In such a situation, the application of the system established by the PNR Directive to selected intra-EU flights must be limited to the transfer and processing of the PNR data of flights relating, inter alia, to certain routes or travel patterns or to certain airports in respect of which there are indications that are such as to justify that application. It is for the Member State concerned, in that situation, to select the intra-EU flights, according to the outcome of the assessment which it must carry out on the basis of the requirements set out in paragraphs\u00a0163 to 169 above, and to review that assessment regularly in accordance with changes in the circumstances that justified their selection, for the purposes of ensuring that the application of the system established by that directive to intra-EU flights continues to be limited to what is strictly necessary.\n175\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that the interpretation, thus followed, of Article\u00a02 and Article\u00a03(4) of the PNR Directive, in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, is capable of ensuring that those provisions are within the limits of what is strictly necessary.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAdvance assessment of PNR data by automated processing\n176\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a06(2)(a) of the PNR Directive, the objective of the advance assessment provided for therein is to identify persons who require further examination, inter alia by the competent authorities referred to in Article\u00a07 of that directive, in view of the fact that such persons may be involved in a terrorist offence or serious crime. \n177\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That advance assessment is carried out in two stages. As a first step, the PIU of the Member State concerned, pursuant to Article\u00a06(3) of the PNR Directive, processes PNR data by automated means by comparing them against databases or pre-determined criteria. As a second step, should that processing by automated means lead to a positive match (\u2018hit\u2019), that unit, pursuant to Article\u00a06(5) of the said directive, is to carry out an individual review by non-automated means to verify whether the competent authorities referred to in Article\u00a07 of the said directive need to take action under national law (\u2018match\u2019).\n178\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As recalled in paragraph\u00a0106 above, automated processing necessarily presents a fairly substantial margin of error, since it is carried out on the basis of unverified personal data and is based on pre-determined criteria. \n179\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, and given the need, highlighted in the fourth recital of the preamble to the Charter, to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in the light, inter alia, of scientific and technological developments, it must be ensured, as stated in recital\u00a020 and Article\u00a07(6) of the PNR Directive, that no decision that produces an adverse legal effect on a person or significantly affects a person may be taken by the competent authorities only by reason of the automated processing of PNR data. Moreover, in accordance with Article\u00a06(6) of that directive, the PIU itself may transfer PNR data to those authorities only after individual review by non-automated means. Lastly, in addition to those verifications which the PIU and the competent authorities are to carry out themselves, the lawfulness of all automated processing must be open to review by the data protection officer and the national supervisory authority, in accordance with Article\u00a06(7) and Article\u00a015(3)(b), respectively, of that directive as well as by the national courts in the context of the judicial redress referred to in Article\u00a013(1) of that same directive.\n180\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in point\u00a0207 of his Opinion, the national supervisory authority, the data protection officer and the PIU must be provided with the material and human resources necessary to carry out their review under the PNR Directive. Furthermore, it is important that the national legislation transposing that directive into domestic law and authorising the automated processing provided for by the directive lays down clear and precise rules for the determination of the databases and criteria for analysis used, without relying, for the purposes of advance assessment, on other methods not referred to expressly in Article\u00a06(2) of that directive.\n181\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it follows from Article\u00a06(9) of the PNR Directive that the consequences of advance assessment under Article\u00a06(2)(a) thereof do not jeopardise the right of entry of persons enjoying the right of free movement within the territory of the Member State concerned as laid down in Directive 2004/38 and must, also, comply with Regulation No\u00a0562/2006. Thus, the system established by the PNR Directive does not allow the competent authorities to limit that right beyond what is prescribed by Directive 2004/38 and Regulation No\u00a0562/2006.\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nComparing PNR data against databases\n182\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a06(3)(a) of the PNR Directive, the PIU \u2018may\u2019, when carrying out the assessment referred to in Article\u00a06(2)(a) of that directive, compare PNR data against \u2018[relevant] databases\u2019 for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime, \u2018including databases on persons or objects sought or under alert, in accordance with [EU], international and national rules applicable to such databases\u2019. \n183\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although it follows from the very wording of that Article\u00a06(3)(a) of the PNR Directive, in particular from the word \u2018including\u2019, that the databases on persons or objects sought or under alert are among the \u2018relevant databases\u2019 referred to in that provision, that provision does not specify which other databases could also be considered to be \u2018relevant\u2019 in the light of the objectives pursued by that directive. As noted by the Advocate General in point\u00a0217 of his Opinion, that provision does not expressly indicate the nature of the data that those databases may contain or their relationship to those objectives nor does it mention whether PNR data must be compared exclusively against databases managed by public authorities or whether they may also be compared against databases managed by private individuals. \n184\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, Article\u00a06(3)(a) of the PNR Directive could, prima facie, lend itself to an interpretation according to which PNR data may be used as mere search criteria for the purposes of conducting analyses using various databases, including databases managed and exploited by the security and intelligence agencies of Member States in order to pursue objectives other than those referred to in that directive, and that those analyses may take the form of \u2018data mining\u2019. The fact that such analyses can be conducted and PNR data compared to such databases may give rise in the minds of passengers of carriage by air to the feeling that their private life is under a form of surveillance. Thus, while the advance assessment provided for in that provision relies on a relatively limited set of PNR data, such an interpretation of that Article\u00a06(3)(a) cannot be adopted, since it would lead to a disproportionate use of those data providing the means of establishing a detailed profile of the individuals concerned solely because they intend to travel by air.\n185\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, according to the case-law recalled in paragraphs\u00a086 and 87 above, Article\u00a06(3)(a) of the PNR Directive must be interpreted in such a way as to ensure full respect for the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter. \n186\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is apparent from recitals\u00a07 and 15 of the PNR Directive that the automated processing provided for in Article\u00a06(3)(a) of that directive must be limited to what is strictly necessary for the purposes of combating terrorist offences and serious crime, while ensuring a high level of protection of those fundamental rights.\n187\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, as observed, in essence, by the Commission in response to a question put by the Court, the wording of that provision, that the PIU \u2018may\u2019 compare PNR data against the databases referred to therein, allows the PIU to choose a processing method that is limited to what is strictly necessary, depending on the particular situation. In the light of the obligation to comply with the requirements of clarity and precision necessary to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, the PIU must limit the automated processing provided for in Article\u00a06(3)(a) of the PNR Directive to the databases identifiable under that provision. In that regard, whereas the reference, in the latter provision, to \u2018relevant databases\u2019 does not lend itself to an interpretation defining in a sufficiently clear and precise manner the databases thus referred to, the same is not true of the reference to \u2018databases on persons or objects sought or under alert, in accordance with [EU], international and national rules applicable to such databases\u2019.\n188\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, as noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in point\u00a0219 of his Opinion, Article\u00a06(3)(a) of the PNR Directive must, in the light of those fundamental rights, be interpreted as meaning that the latter databases are the only databases against which the PIU may compare PNR data.\n189\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the requirements which those databases must satisfy, it is appropriate to note that, under Article\u00a06(4) of the PNR Directive, advance assessment against pre-determined criteria must, pursuant to Article\u00a06(3)(b) of that directive, be carried out in a non-discriminatory manner, those criteria must be targeted, proportionate and specific, and must be set and regularly reviewed by the PIUs in cooperation with the competent authorities referred to in Article\u00a07 of the directive. If, by referring to Article\u00a06(3)(b) of that directive, the wording of Article\u00a06(4) thereof covers only the processing of PNR data against pre-determined criteria, the latter provision must be interpreted, in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 21 of the Charter, as meaning that the requirements it lays down apply \nmutatis mutandis\n to the comparison of those data against the databases referred in the preceding paragraph, especially since those requirements correspond, in essence, to those adopted by the case-law arising from Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017 (EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0172), for the purposes of cross-checking PNR data against databases.\n190\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be stated that the requirement as to the non-discriminatory nature of those databases implies, inter alia, that entry into the databases on persons sought or under alert is based on objective and non-discriminatory factors, defined in EU, international and national rules applicable to such databases (see, by analogy, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a078). \n191\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, in order to satisfy the requirement as to the targeted, proportionate and specific nature of the pre-determined criteria, the databases referred to in paragraph\u00a0188 above must be used in relation to the fight against terrorist offences and serious crime having an objective link, even if only an indirect one, with the carriage of passengers by air. \n192\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the databases used pursuant to Article\u00a06(3)(a) of the PNR Directive must, in view of the considerations set out in paragraphs\u00a0183 and 184 above, be managed by the competent authorities referred to in Article\u00a07 of that directive or, with regard to EU databases as well as international databases, be exploited by those authorities in the context of their mission to combat terrorist offences and serious crime. That is the case of the databases on persons or objects sought or under alert, in accordance with the EU, international and national rules applicable to such databases. \n(ii)\u00a0\nProcessing PNR data against pre-determined criteria\n193\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06(3)(b) of the PNR Directive provides that the PIU may also process PNR data against pre-determined criteria. As is apparent from Article\u00a06(2)(a) of that directive, the advance assessment and, accordingly, the processing of PNR data against pre-determined criteria is intended, in essence, to identify persons who may be involved in a terrorist offence or serious crime.\n194\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the criteria that the PIU may use to that end, it should be noted, first, that according to the very wording of Article\u00a06(3)(b) of the PNR Directive those must be \u2018pre-determined\u2019 criteria. As noted by the Advocate General in point\u00a0228 of his Opinion, that requirement precludes the use of artificial intelligence technology in self-learning systems (\u2018machine learning\u2019), capable of modifying without human intervention or review the assessment process and, in particular, the assessment criteria on which the result of the application of that process is based as well as the weighting of those criteria. \n195\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is important to add that use of such technology would be liable to render redundant the individual review of positive matches and monitoring of lawfulness required by the provisions of the PNR Directive. As observed, in essence, by the Advocate General in point\u00a0228 of his Opinion, given the opacity which characterises the way in which artificial intelligence technology works, it might be impossible to understand the reason why a given program arrived at a positive match. In those circumstances, use of such technology may deprive the data subjects also of their right to an effective judicial remedy enshrined in Article\u00a047 of the Charter, for which the PNR Directive, according to recital\u00a028 thereof, seeks to ensure a high level of protection, in particular in order to challenge the non-discriminatory nature of the results obtained.\n196\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concerning, next, the requirements flowing from Article\u00a06(4) of the PNR Directive, that provision states, in its first sentence, that any advance assessment against pre-determined criteria is to be carried out in a non-discriminatory manner and indicates, in its fourth sentence, that those criteria are in no circumstances to be based on a person\u2019s race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, sexual life or sexual orientation. \n197\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus Member States cannot use, as pre-determined criteria, criteria that are based on the characteristics referred to in the preceding paragraph and use of which may result in discrimination. In that regard, it follows from the wording of the fourth sentence of Article\u00a06(4) of the PNR Directive, according to which pre-determined criteria are \u2018in no circumstances\u2019 to be based on those characteristics, that that provision covers both direct and indirect discrimination. That interpretation is, moreover, confirmed by Article\u00a021(1) of the Charter, in the light of which the said provision must be read, which prohibits \u2018any\u2019 discrimination based on the said characteristics. In those circumstances, pre-determined criteria must be defined in such a way that, while worded in a neutral fashion, their application does not place persons having the protected characteristics at a particular disadvantage.\n198\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the requirements relating to the targeted, proportionate and specific nature of pre-determined criteria, referred to in the second sentence of Article\u00a06(4) of the PNR Directive, it follows from those requirements that the criteria used for the purposes of advance assessment must be determined in such a way as to target, specifically, individuals who might be reasonably suspected of involvement in terrorist offences or serious crime covered by that directive. That reading is supported by the very wording of Article\u00a06(2)(a) thereof, which emphasises the \u2018fact\u2019 that the persons concerned \u2018may\u2019 be involved in \u2018a\u2019 terrorist offence or serious crime. In the same vein, recital\u00a07 of the said directive states that the creation and application of assessment criteria should be limited to terrorist offences and serious crime \u2018for which the use of such criteria is relevant\u2019.\n199\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to target in that way the persons thus referred to and given the risk of discrimination that criteria based on the characteristics set out in the fourth sentence of Article\u00a06(4) of the PNR Directive entail, the PIU and the competent authorities cannot, generally, rely on those characteristics. By contrast, as pointed out by the German Government at the hearing, they can inter alia take into consideration specific features in the factual conduct of persons when preparing and engaging in air travel which, following the findings of and experience acquired by the competent authorities, might suggest that the persons acting in that way may be involved in terrorist offences or serious crime. \n200\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, as noted by the Commission in response to a question put by the Court, pre-determined criteria must be defined in such a way as to take into consideration both \u2018incriminating\u2019 as well as \u2018exonerating\u2019 circumstances, since that requirement may contribute to the reliability of those criteria and, in particular, ensure that they are proportionate, as required by the second sentence Article\u00a06(4) of the PNR Directive. \n201\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, the third sentence of Article\u00a06(4) of that directive provides that pre-determined criteria must be reviewed regularly. In the context of that review, those criteria must be updated in accordance with changes in the circumstances that justified their being taken into consideration for the purposes of advance assessment, thus making it possible, inter alia, to react to developments in the fight against terrorist offences and serious crime referred to in paragraph\u00a0157 above (see, by analogy, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a082). In particular, that review must take into account the experience acquired in the context of the application of pre-determined criteria, in order to reduce, as much as possible, the number of \u2018false positives\u2019 and, thereby, contribute to the strictly necessary nature of the application of those criteria.\n(iii)\u00a0\nSafeguards surrounding the automated processing of PNR data\n202\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compliance with the requirements to which the automated processing of PNR data is subject under Article\u00a06(4) of the PNR Directive is required not only when determining and reviewing the databases as well as the pre-determined criteria provided for in that provision, but also, as noted by the Advocate General in point\u00a0230 of his Opinion, throughout the process of processing those data. \n203\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards pre-determined criteria specifically, it is appropriate, first of all, to specify that, although the PIU, as stated in recital\u00a07 of the PNR Directive, must define the assessment criteria in a manner which keeps to a minimum the number of innocent people wrongly identified by the system established by that directive, that unit must still, in accordance with Article\u00a06(5) and (6) of the said directive, individually review any positive match by non-automated means in order to identify, as much as possible, any \u2018false positives\u2019. In addition, notwithstanding the fact that they must set the assessment criteria in a non-discriminatory manner, the PIU is required to carry out such a review for the purposes of excluding any discriminatory results. The PIU must comply with that same review obligation when comparing PNR data against databases.\n204\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the PIU must refrain from transferring the results of those automated processing operations to the competent authorities referred to Article\u00a07 of the PNR Directive when, having regard to the considerations set out in paragraph\u00a0198 above, they do not, following that review, have anything capable of giving rise, to the requisite legal standard, to a reasonable suspicion of involvement in terrorist offences or serious crime in respect of the persons identified by means of those automated processing operations or when they have reason to believe that those processing operations lead to discriminatory results.\n205\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the verifications which the PIU must carry out to that end, it follows from Article\u00a06(5) and (6) of the PNR Directive, read in conjunction with recitals\u00a020 and 22 thereof, that Member States must lay down clear and precise rules capable of providing guidance and support for the analysis carried out by the agents in charge of the individual review, for the purposes of ensuring full respect for the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07, 8 and 21 of the Charter and, in particular, guarantee a uniform administrative practice within the PIU that observes the principle of non-discrimination.\n206\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, given the fairly substantial number of \u2018false positives\u2019, mentioned in paragraph\u00a0106 above, Member States must ensure that the PIU establishes, in a clear and precise manner, objective review criteria enabling its agents to verify, on the one hand, whether and to what extent a positive match (\u2018hit\u2019) concerns effectively an individual who may be involved in the terrorist offences or serious crime referred to in paragraph\u00a0157 above and must, therefore, be subject to further examination by the competent authorities referred to Article\u00a07 of that directive, as well as, on the other hand, the non-discriminatory nature of automated processing operations under that directive and, in particular, the pre-determined criteria and databases used.\n207\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, Member States are required to ensure that, in accordance with Article\u00a013(5) of the PNR Directive, read in conjunction with recital\u00a037 thereof, the PIUs maintain documentation relating to all processing of PNR data carried out in connection with the advance assessment, including in the context of the individual review by non-automated means, for the purpose of verifying its lawfulness and for the purpose of self-monitoring.\n208\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, the competent authorities, pursuant to the first sentence of Article\u00a07(6) of the PNR Directive, cannot take any decision that produces an adverse legal effect on a person or significantly affects a person only by reason of the automated processing of PNR data, which means, in connection with the advance assessment, that they must take into consideration and, where applicable, give preference to the result of the individual review conducted by non-automated means by the PIU over that obtained by automated processing. The second sentence of that Article\u00a07(6) specifies that those decisions must not be discriminatory. \n209\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the competent authorities must ensure the lawfulness of the automated processing, in particular its non-discriminatory nature, as well as that of the individual review.\n210\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the competent authorities must ensure that the person concerned\u00a0\u2013 without necessarily allowing that person, during the administrative procedure, to become aware of the pre-determined assessment criteria and programs applying those criteria\u00a0\u2013 is able to understand how those criteria and those programs work, so that it is possible for that person to decide with full knowledge of the relevant facts whether or not to exercise his or her right to the judicial redress guaranteed in Article\u00a013(1) of the PNR Directive, in order to call in question, as the case may be, the unlawful and, inter alia, discriminatory nature of the said criteria (see, by analogy, judgment of 24\u00a0November 2020, \nMinister van Buitenlandse Zaken\n, C-225/19 and C-226/19, EU:C:2020:951, paragraph\u00a043 and the case-law cited). The same must apply to the review criteria mentioned in paragraph\u00a0206 above.\n211\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, in the context of redress introduced pursuant to Article\u00a013(1) of the PNR Directive, the court responsible for reviewing the legality of the decision adopted by the competent authorities as well as, except in the case of threats to State security, the persons concerned themselves must have had an opportunity to examine both all the grounds and the evidence on the basis of which the decision was taken (see, by analogy, judgment of 4\u00a0June 2013, \nZZ\n, C-300/11, EU:C:2013:363, paragraphs\u00a054 to 59), including the pre-determined assessment criteria and the operation of the programs applying those criteria.\n212\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, according to Article\u00a06(7) and Article\u00a015(3)(b), respectively, of the PNR Directive, it is for the data protection officer and the national supervisory authority to ensure the monitoring of the lawfulness of the automated processing carried out by the PIU in connection with the advance assessment, monitoring which covers, inter alia, whether those operations are not discriminatory. While the first of those provisions states, to that end, that the data protection officer has access to all data processed by the PIU, that access must necessarily cover the pre-determined criteria and databases used by that unit in order to guarantee effectivenes and a high level of data protection that that officer must ensure in accordance with recital\u00a037 of that directive. Similarly, the investigations, inspections and audits that the national supervisory authority conducts pursuant to the second of those provisions may also concern those pre-determined criteria and those databases.\n213\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all of the foregoing that the provisions of the PNR Directive governing the advance assessment of PNR data under Article\u00a06(2)(a) of that directive lend themselves to an interpretation that is consistent with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 21 of the Charter and comes within the limits of what is strictly necessary. \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe disclosure and subsequent assessment of PNR data\n214\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Article\u00a06(2)(b) of the PNR Directive, PNR data may also, on request of the competent authorities, be provided to the latter and assessed subsequently to the scheduled arrival in or departure from the Member State. \n215\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the circumstances in which that disclosure and assessment may occur, it is apparent from the wording of that provision that the PIU may process PNR data in order to respond \u2018on a case-by-case basis\u2019 to \u2018a duly reasoned request based on sufficient grounds\u2019 from the competent authorities to have those data disclosed to them and processed \u2018in specific cases for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences or serious crime\u2019. In addition, where a request is introduced more than six months after the transfer of the PNR data to the PIU, a period upon the expiry of which the PNR data are depersonalised through masking out of certain elements, pursuant to Article\u00a012(2) of that directive, Article\u00a012(3) of the said directive provides that disclosure of the full PNR data and, therefore, a non-depersonalised version thereof, is permitted only under the dual condition that, first, it is reasonably believed that it is necessary for the purposes referred to in Article\u00a06(2)(b) of the said directive and, secondly, it is approved by a judicial authority or another national authority competent under national law. \n216\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is apparent, first of all, from the very wording of Article\u00a06(2)(b) of the PNR Directive that the PIU cannot systematically proceed to the subsequent disclosure and assessment of the PNR data of all air passengers and that it can only respond \u2018on a case-by-case basis\u2019 to requests relating to such processing operations \u2018in specific cases\u2019. Having said that, in so far as that provision referred to \u2018specific cases\u2019, those processing operations must not necessarily be limited to the PNR data of a single air passenger but may, as noted by the Commission in response to a question put by the Court, also concern groups of persons provided that the persons concerned share a certain number of characteristics allowing them to be considered to constitute together a \u2018specific case\u2019 for the purposes of the intended data disclosure and assessment.\n217\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concerning, next, the substantive conditions required for the PNR data of air passengers to be disclosed and assessed subsequently, although Article\u00a06(2)(b) and Article\u00a012(3)(a) of the PNR Directive use \u2018sufficient grounds\u2019 and \u2018reasonably\u2019, respectively, without expressly specifying the nature of such grounds, it nonetheless follows from the very wording of the first of those provisions, which refers to the purposes mentioned in Article\u00a01(2) of the said directive, that PNR data can be disclosed and assessed subsequently only in order to verify whether there are indications that the data subject may be involved in terrorist offences or serious crime having, as follows from paragraph\u00a0157 above, an objective link, even if only an indirect one, with the carriage of passengers by air.\n218\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the context of the system established by the PNR Directive, the disclosure and processing of PNR data under Article\u00a06(2)(b) of that directive concern the data of persons who have already been subject to advance assessment prior to their scheduled arrival in or departure from the Member State concerned. In addition, a request for subsequent assessment may relate, inter alia, to persons whose PNR data have not been transferred to the competent authorities following an advance assessment, in so far as the latter has revealed nothing to suggest that those persons may be involved in terrorist offences or serious crime having an objective link, even if only an indirect one, with the carriage of passengers by air. In those circumstances, the disclosure and processing of those data for the purposes of their subsequent assessment must be based on new circumstances justifying that use (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) \nof 26\u00a0July 2017, \nEU:C:2017:592\n, paragraph\u00a0200 and the case-law cited). \n219\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the nature of the circumstances capable of justifying the disclosure and processing of PNR data for the purposes of their subsequent assessment, it is settled case-law that, since general access to all retained data, regardless of whether there is any, at least indirect, link with the intended purpose, cannot be regarded as being limited to what is strictly necessary, the legislation concerned, be it EU legislation or a national rule intended to transpose the latter, must be based on objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which the competent national authorities are to be granted access to the data in question. In that regard, such access can, as a general rule, be granted, in relation to the objective of combating crime, only to the data of individuals suspected of planning, committing or having committed a serious crime or of being implicated in one way or another in such a crime. However, in particular situations, where for example vital national security, defence or public security interests are threatened by terrorist activities, access to the data of other persons might also be granted where there is objective evidence from which it can be inferred that that data might, in a specific case, make an effective contribution to combating such activities (judgments of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraph\u00a050 and the case-law cited, and of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0105).\n220\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the terms \u2018sufficient grounds\u2019 and \u2018reasonably\u2019 in Article\u00a06(2)(b) and Article\u00a012(3)(a), respectively, of the PNR Directive must be interpreted, in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, as referring to objective evidence capable of giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the person concerned is involved in one way or another in serious crime having an objective link, even if only an indirect one, with the carriage of passengers by air, whereas, as regards terrorist offences having such a link, that requirement is satisfied when there is objective evidence from which it can be inferred that the PNR data could, in a given case, contribute effectively to combating such offences. \n221\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, as regards the procedural conditions governing the disclosure and processing of PNR data for the purposes of their subsequent assessment, Article\u00a012(3)(b) of the PNR Directive requires, where the request is introduced more than six months after their transfer to the PIU, that is to say when, pursuant to paragraph\u00a02 of that article, those data have been depersonalised through masking out of the elements referred to in that paragraph\u00a02, that the disclosure of the full PNR data and, therefore, of a non-depersonalised version thereof, must be approved by a judicial authority or by another national authority competent under national law. In that context, it is for those authorities to examine in full the merits of the request and, in particular, to ascertain whether the evidence in support of that request is likely to substantiate the substantive condition for the existence of \u2018reasonabl[e]\u2019 grounds referred to in the preceding paragraph.\n222\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, where a request for the subsequent disclosure and assessment of PNR data is introduced before the expiry of the period of six months after the transfer of those data, Article\u00a06(2)(b) of the PNR Directive does not expressly provide for such a procedural requirement. Nonetheless, the interpretation of the latter provision must take into consideration recital\u00a025 of that directive, from which it is apparent that, by laying down the said procedural requirement, the EU legislature intended \u2018to ensure the highest level of data protection\u2019 concerning access to PNR data in a form which permits direct identification of the data subject. Any request for subsequent disclosure and assessment implies such access to those data, irrespective of whether that request is introduced before the expiry of the period of six months after the transfer of the PNR data to the PIU or whether it is introduced after the expiry of that period.\n223\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, in order to ensure, in practice, that fundamental rights are fully observed in the system put in place by the PNR Directive and, in particular, the conditions set out in paragraphs\u00a0218 and 219 above, it is essential that disclosure of PNR data for the purposes of subsequent assessment be, as a general rule, except in the event of duly justified urgency, subject to a prior review carried out either by a court or by an independent administrative authority, and that the decision of that court or body be made following a reasoned request by the competent authorities submitted, inter alia, within the framework of procedures for the prevention, detection or prosecution of crime. In the event of duly justified urgency, the review must take place within a short time (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0202 and the case-law cited, and judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0110).\n224\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the requirement for prior review under Article\u00a012(3)(b) of the PNR Directive, for requests for the disclosure of PNR data introduced after the expiry of a period of six months following the transfer of those data to the PIU must also apply, \nmutatis mutandis\n, where the request for disclosure is introduced before the expiry of that period.\n225\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, if Article\u00a012(3)(b) of the PNR Directive does not expressly specify the requirements which the authority responsible for carrying out the prior review must satisfy, it is settled case-law that, in order to ensure that the interference with the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter which results from access to personal data is limited to what is strictly necessary, that authority must have all the powers and provide all the guarantees necessary in order to reconcile the various interests and rights at issue. As regards a criminal investigation in particular, it is a requirement of such a review that that authority must be able to strike a fair balance between, on the one hand, the interests relating to the needs of the investigation in the context of combating crime and, on the other, the fundamental rights to privacy and protection of personal data of the persons whose data are concerned by the access (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, \n\u00a0\nparagraph\u00a0107 and the case-law cited).\n226\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For that purpose, such an authority must have a status that enables it to act objectively and impartially when carrying out its duties and must, therefore, be free from any external influence. That requirement of independence means that that authority must be a third party in relation to the authority which requests access to the data, in order that the former is able to carry out the review, free from any external influence. In particular, in the criminal field, the requirement of independence entails that the said authority, first, should not be involved in the conduct of the criminal investigation in question and, secondly, must have a neutral stance vis-a-vis the parties to the criminal proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0108 and the case-law cited).\n227\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the provisions of the PNR Directive governing the subsequent disclosure and assessment of PNR data pursuant to Article\u00a06(2)(b) of that directive lend themselves to an interpretation that is consistent with Articles\u00a07 and 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter and comes within the limits of what is strictly necessary.\n228\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, given that an interpretation of the PNR Directive in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 21 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter ensures that that directive is consistent with those articles of the Charter, the examination of Questions 2 to 4 and Question 6 has revealed nothing capable of affecting the validity of the said directive.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nQuestion 5\n229\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its Question 5, the referring court seeks to ascertain whether Article\u00a06 of the PNR Directive, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which authorises PNR data collected in accordance with that directive to be processed for the purposes of monitoring activities by the intelligence and security services.\n230\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the request for a preliminary ruling that, by that question, the referring court refers specifically to the activities covered by the S\u00fbret\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9tat (State Security Services, Belgium) and the Service g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du renseignement et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (General intelligence and security services, Belgium), in the context of their respective duties relating to the protection of national security.\n231\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in order to comply with the principles of legality and proportionality referred to in Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, the EU legislature provided clear and precise rules governing the purposes of the measures provided for by the PNR Directive which interfere with the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n232\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01(2) of the PNR Directive states expressly that the PNR data collected in accordance with that directive may be processed \u2018only for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime, as provided for in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article\u00a06(2) [of the said directive]\u2019. The latter provision confirms the principle set out in that Article\u00a01(2), by referring systematically to the concepts of \u2018terrorist offence\u2019 and \u2018serious crime\u2019.\n233\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is thus clear from the wording of those provisions that the list included therein of the objectives pursued by the processing of PNR data under the PNR Directive is exhaustive.\n234\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is supported, inter alia, by recital\u00a011 of the PNR Directive, according to which the processing of PNR data should be proportionate to \u2018the specific security goals\u2019 pursued by that directive, and by Article\u00a07(4) thereof, according to which the PNR data and the result of processing those data received by the PIU may be further processed \u2018only for the specific purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating or prosecuting terrorist offences or serious crime\u2019.\n235\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the exhaustive nature of the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(2) of the PNR Directive means also that PNR data may not be retained in a single database that may be consulted both for those as well as other purposes. Retention of those data in such a database would entail the risk that those data be used for purposes other than those referred to in that Article\u00a01(2).\n236\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, in so far as, according to the referring court, the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings includes, among the purposes for which PNR data is to be processed, monitoring activities within the remit of the intelligence and security services, thus treating that purpose as an integral part of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime, that legislation is liable to disregard the exhaustive nature of the list of the objectives pursued by the processing of PNR data under the PNR Directive, which is a matter for the referring court to verify. \n237\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the answer to Question 5 is that Article\u00a06 of the PNR Directive, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which authorises PNR data collected in accordance with that directive to be processed for purposes other than those expressly referred to in Article\u00a01(2) of the said directive.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nQuestion 7\n238\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its Question 7, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a012(3)(b) of the PNR Directive must be interpreted as precluding national legislation pursuant to which the authority put in place as the PIU is also designated as a competent national authority with power to approve the disclosure of PNR data upon expiry of the period of six months after the transfer of those data to the PIU.\n239\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it must be noted that the Belgian Government harbours doubts as to whether the Court has jurisdiction to answer that question, as formulated by the referring court, given that the latter court is the only one with jurisdiction to interpret provisions of national law and, in particular, assess the requirements stemming from the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016 in the light of Article\u00a012(3)(b) of the PNR Directive.\n240\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, suffice it to note that, by that question, the referring court is seeking the interpretation of a provision of EU law. In addition, if, in proceedings brought on the basis of Article\u00a0267 TFEU, the interpretation of provisions of national law is a matter for the courts of the Member States, not for the Court of Justice, and the Court has no jurisdiction to rule on the compatibility of rules of national law with EU law, the Court does have jurisdiction to provide the national court with all the guidance as to the interpretation of EU law necessary to enable that court to determine whether those national rules are compatible with EU law (judgment of 30\u00a0April 2020, \nCTT\u00a0\u2013 Correios de Portugal\n, C-661/18, EU:C:2020:335, paragraph\u00a028 and the case-law cited). It follows that the Court has jurisdiction to answer Question 7.\n241\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the substance, it should be noted that the wording of Article\u00a012(3)(b) of the PNR Directive, which in its points (i) and (ii) refers to \u2018a judicial authority\u2019 and \u2018another national authority competent under national law to verify whether the conditions for disclosure are met\u2019, respectively, places both authorities on the same footing as is apparent from the use of the conjunction \u2018or\u2019 between those points (i) and (ii). It thus follows from that wording that the \u2018other\u2019 competent national authority thus referred to is an alternative to the judicial authority and, accordingly, must have a level of independence and impartiality similar to the latter.\n242\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That analysis is supported by the objective of the PNR Directive, mentioned in recital\u00a025 thereof, to ensure the highest level of data protection concerning access to the full PNR data, which enable direct identification of the data subject. That same recital specifies, moreover, that that access should be granted only under very strict conditions after the period of six months following the transfer of PNR data to the PIU. \n243\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That analysis is also corroborated by the history of the PNR Directive. Whereas the proposal for a directive mentioned in paragraph\u00a0155 above, which became the PNR Directive, simply provided that \u2018access to the full PNR data shall be permitted only by the Head of the Passenger Information Unit\u2019, the version of Article\u00a012(3)(b) of that directive finally adopted by the EU legislature designates, placing them on the same footing, the judicial authority and \u2018another national authority\u2019 competent to verify whether the conditions for disclosure of the full PNR data are met and approve such disclosure.\n244\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition and, most importantly, according to the settled case-law recalled in paragraphs\u00a0223, 225 and 226 above, it is essential that access to retained data by the competent authorities be subject to a prior review carried out either by a court or by an independent administrative body, and that the decision of that court or body be made following a reasoned request by those authorities submitted, inter alia, within the framework of procedures for the prevention, detection or prosecution of crime. The requirement of independence that the body responsible for carrying out the prior review must satisfy also means that that body must be a third party in relation to the authority which requests access to the data, in order that the former is able to carry out the review objectively and impartially, and free from any external influence. In particular, in the criminal field the requirement of independence entails that the authority responsible for that prior review, first, should not be involved in the conduct of the criminal investigation in question and, secondly, must have a neutral stance vis-a-vis the parties to the criminal proceedings.\n245\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted by the Advocate General in point\u00a0271 of his Opinion, Article\u00a04 of the PNR Directive, in paragraphs\u00a01 and 3 thereof, provides that the PIU established or designated in each Member State is an authority competent for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and of serious crime, and that its staff members may be agents seconded from the competent authorities referred to in Article\u00a07 of that directive, so that the PIU appears necessarily linked to those authorities. The PIU may also, pursuant to Article\u00a06(2)(b) of the said directive, process PNR data and disclose the results to the said authorities. In the light of the foregoing, the PIU cannot be considered to be a third party in relation to those authorities and, accordingly, to have all the qualities of independence and impartiality required to carry out the prior review mentioned in the preceding paragraph and verify whether the conditions for disclosure of the full PNR data are met, as provided for in Article\u00a012(3)(b) of that directive. \n246\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the fact that the latter provision requires, in its point (ii), where disclosure of the full PNR data has been approved by \u2018another [competent] national authority\u2019, that the data protection officer of the PIU \u2018[is] inform[ed] and [carries out] an \nex post\n review\u2019, whereas this is not the case for approval by the judicial authority, is not such as to call that assessment into question. In accordance with well-established case-law, a subsequent review, such as that carried out by the data protection officer, does not enable the objective of a prior review, consisting in preventing the authorisation of access to the data in question that exceeds what is strictly necessary, to be met (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0110 and the case-law cited).\n247\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all of those considerations, the answer to Question 7 is that Article\u00a012(3)(b) of the PNR Directive must be interpreted as precluding national legislation pursuant to which the authority put in place as the PIU is also designated as a competent national authority with power to approve the disclosure of PNR data upon expiry of the period of six months after the transfer of those data to the PIU.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nQuestion 8\n248\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its Question 8, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a012 of the PNR Directive, read in conjunction with Articles\u00a07 and 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides for a general retention period of five years for PNR data, without drawing any distinction based on whether or not the passengers concerned present a risk that relates to terrorist offences or serious crime.\n249\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be recalled that, under Article\u00a012(1) and (4) of that directive, the PIU of the Member State on the territory of which the flight concerned is landing or departing retains the PNR data provided by the air carriers in a database for a period of five years after their transfer to that unit and deletes such data permanently upon expiry of that period of five years.\n250\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As recalled in recital\u00a025 of the PNR Directive, \u2018the period during which PNR data are to be retained should be as long as is necessary for and proportionate to the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime\u2019.\n251\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the retention of PNR data pursuant to Article\u00a012(1) of the PNR Directive cannot be justified in the absence of an objective connection between that retention and the objectives pursued by that directive, namely the fight against terrorist offences and serious crime having an objective link, even if only an indirect one, with the carriage of passengers by air. \n252\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as is apparent from recital\u00a025 of the PNR Directive, a distinction must be drawn between, on the one hand, the initial retention period of six months, referred to in Article\u00a012(2) of that directive, and, on the other hand, the later period referred to in Article\u00a012(3) of the said directive.\n253\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The interpretation of Article\u00a012(1) of the PNR Directive must take into account the provisions in paragraphs\u00a02 and 3 of that article, which lay down a set of rules for the retention of and access to PNR data retained after expiry of the initial retention period of six months. As is apparent from recital\u00a025 of that directive, those provisions reflect, on the one hand, the objective of ensuring \u2018that the PNR data be retained for a sufficiently long period to carry out analysis and for use in investigations\u2019, which may be carried out already during the initial retention period of six months. On the other hand, according to that recital\u00a025, they seek to \u2018avoid disproportionate use\u2019 through masking out of those data and to \u2018ensure the highest level of data protection\u2019 by granting access to those data in a form which permits direct identification of the data subject \u2018only under very strict and limited conditions after that initial period\u2019, thus having regard to the fact that the longer the period for the retention of PNR data, the more serious the resulting interference.\n254\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The distinction between the initial retention period of six months referred to in Article\u00a012(2) of the PNR Directive and the later period referred to in Article\u00a012(3) of that directive applies also to the obligation to comply with the requirement referred to in paragraph\u00a0251 above.\n255\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in view of the aims pursued by the PNR Directive and of the needs of the investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime, the Court finds that the retention, during the initial period of six months, of the PNR data of all air passengers subject to the system established by that directive, without any indication as to their involvement in terrorist offences or serious crime does not appear, as a matter of principle, to go beyond what is strictly necessary, in so far as it allows the necessary searches to be carried out for the purposes of identifying the persons who were not suspected of involvement in terrorist offences or serious crime. \n256\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, as to the later period, set out in Article\u00a012(3) of the PNR Directive, the retention of the PNR data of all air passengers subject to the system established by that directive, in addition to the fact that, by reason of the significant quantity of data that may be retained continuously, it entails an inherent risk of disproportionate use and abuse (see, by analogy, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, \nEU:C:2020:791\n, paragraph\u00a0119), runs counter to the requirement in recital\u00a025 of the said directive that the period during which those data are to be retained should be as long as is necessary for and proportionate to the objectives pursued, since the EU legislature intended to establish the highest level of protection of PNR data allowing direct identification of the data subjects.\n257\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards air passengers for whom neither the advance assessment under Article\u00a06(2)(a) of the PNR Directive nor any verification carried out during the period of six months referred to in Article\u00a012(2) of that directive nor any other circumstance have revealed the existence of objective evidence capable of establishing a risk that relates to terrorist offences or serious crime having an objective link, even if only an indirect one, with those passengers\u2019 air travel, there would not appear to be, in such circumstances, any connection\u00a0\u2013 even a merely indirect one\u00a0\u2013 between the PNR data of those passengers and the objective pursued by the said directive which would justify the retention of those data (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) \nof 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0204 and 205).\n258\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The continued storage of the PNR data of all air passengers after the initial period of six months is not therefore limited to what is strictly necessary (see, by analogy Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0206).\n259\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in so far as, in specific cases, objective evidence, such as the PNR data of passengers which gave rise to a verified positive match, is identified from which it may be inferred that certain passengers may present a risk that relates to terrorist offences or serious crime, it seems permissible to store their PNR data beyond that initial period (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement\n)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0207 and the case-law cited).\n260\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Identification of that objective evidence is capable of establishing a connection with the objectives pursued by processing under the PNR Directive, with the result that the retention of the PNR data of those passengers is justified during the maximum period permitted by the said directive, namely during five years.\n261\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, in so far as the legislation at issue in the main proceedings appears to prescribe a general retention period of five years for PNR data, applicable indiscriminately to all passengers, including those for whom neither the advance assessment under Article\u00a06(2)(a) of the PNR Directive nor any verification carried out in the initial period of six months nor any other circumstance have revealed the existence of objective evidence capable of establishing a risk that relates to terrorist offences or serious crime, that legislation is liable to infringe Article\u00a012(1) of that directive, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, unless it may be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with those provisions, which is a matter for the referring court to ascertain.\n262\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the Question 8 is that Article\u00a012(1) of the PNR Directive, read in conjunction with Articles\u00a07 and 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides for a general retention period of five years for PNR data, applicable indiscriminately to all air passengers, including those for whom neither the advance assessment under Article\u00a06(2)(a) of that directive nor any verification carried out during the period of six months referred to in Article\u00a012(2) of the said directive nor any other circumstance have revealed the existence of objective evidence capable of establishing a risk that relates to terrorist offences or serious crime having an objective link, even if only an indirect one, with the carriage of passengers by air.\nF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nQuestion 9(a)\n263\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its Question 9(a), the referring court raises the question, in essence, of the validity of the API Directive in the light of Article\u00a03(2) TEU and Article\u00a045 of the Charter, based on the premiss that the obligations introduced by that directive apply to intra-EU flights.\n264\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted by the Advocate General in point\u00a0277 of his Opinion and as observed by the Council, the Commission and several governments, that premiss is incorrect.\n265\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03(1) of the API Directive provides that Member States are to take the necessary steps to establish an obligation for carriers to transmit at the request of the authorities responsible for carrying out checks on persons at external borders, by the end of check-in, information concerning the passengers they will carry to an authorised border crossing point through which these persons will enter the territory of a Member State. Those data are to be communicated, pursuant to Article\u00a06(1) of the said directive, to the authorities responsible for carrying out checks at external borders through which the passenger will enter that territory and are to be processed in accordance with the latter provision.\n266\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from those provisions, read in the light of Article\u00a02(a), (b) and (d) of the API Directive, where the concepts of \u2018carrier\u2019, \u2018external borders\u2019 and \u2018border crossing point\u2019, are defined, respectively, that that directive imposes the obligation, for air carriers, to transmit the data referred to in Article\u00a03(2) thereof, to the authorities responsible for carrying out external border checks only in the case of flights transporting passengers to an authorised crossing point for crossing the Member States\u2019 external borders with third countries and provides that only the data relating to those flights are to be processed. \n267\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, the said directive does not impose any obligation concerning the data of passengers travelling on flights that cross only internal borders between Member States. \n268\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be added that the PNR Directive, by including among PNR data, as is apparent from recital\u00a09 and Article\u00a08(2) thereof, the data referred to in Article\u00a03(2) of the API Directive collected in accordance with that directive and retained by certain air carriers, and by granting Member States the power to apply the PNR Directive, pursuant to Article\u00a02 thereof, to the intra-EU flights selected by them, altered neither the scope of the provisions of the API Directive nor the limitations stemming from that directive.\n269\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Question 9(a) is that the API Directive must be interpreted as not applying to intra-EU flights.\nG.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nQuestion 9(b)\n270\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While, by its Question 9(b), the referring court refers to the API Directive, read in conjunction with Article\u00a03(2) TEU and Article\u00a045 of the Charter, it is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling that that court has doubts as to whether the system for the transfer and processing of passenger data established by the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016 is compatible with the free movement of persons and the abolition of internal border control provided for by EU law, in that that system applies not only to transport by air, but also transport by rail, by road or even by sea, departing from or going to Belgium and carried out within the European Union, without crossing external borders with third countries.\n271\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from paragraphs\u00a0265 to 269 above, the API Directive, which does not apply to intra-EU flights and does not impose any obligation to transfer and process the data of passengers travelling by air or by another mode of transport within the European Union, without crossing external borders with third countries, is irrelevant for the purposes of answering that question.\n272\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, and whereas, according to Article\u00a067(2) TFEU, the European Union is to ensure the absence of internal border controls for persons, Article\u00a02 of the PNR Directive, on which the Belgian legislature relied to adopt the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016 at issue in the main proceedings, as is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling, authorises Member States to apply that directive to intra-EU flights.\n273\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, in order to provide a useful answer to the referring court, it is appropriate to reformulate Question 9(b) as seeking to clarify, in essence, whether EU law, in particular Article\u00a02 of the PNR Directive, read in the light of Article\u00a03(2) TEU, Article\u00a067(2) TFEU and Article\u00a045 of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides for a system for the transfer, by carriers and tour operators, as well as for the processing, by the competent authorities, of the PNR data of flights and transport operations carried out by other means within the European Union and departing from, going to or transiting through the Member State which adopted the said legislation.\n274\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, Article\u00a045 of the Charter enshrines the free movement of persons, which is, moreover, one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nOrdre des barreaux francophones et germanophone and Others (Preventive measures for removal)\n, C-718/19, EU:C:2021:505, paragraph\u00a054). \n275\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That article guarantees, in paragraph\u00a01 thereof, the right of every citizen of the European Union to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, a right which, according to the Explanations relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights (OJ 2007 C\u00a0303, p.\u00a017), corresponds to that guaranteed in the first subparagraph of Article\u00a020(2) TFEU, under (a), and is to be exercised, under the second subparagraph of Article\u00a020(2) TFEU and Article\u00a052(2) of the Charter, in accordance with the conditions and the limits defined by the Treaties and by the measures adopted thereunder.\n276\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, Article\u00a03(2) TEU provides that the European Union is to offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of persons is ensured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect, inter alia, to external border controls and the prevention and combating of crime. Similarly, according to Article\u00a067(2) TFEU, the European Union is to ensure the absence of internal border controls for persons and to frame a common policy on, inter alia, external border control. \n277\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with the Court\u2019s established case-law, national legislation which places certain nationals at a disadvantage simply because they have exercised their freedom to move and to reside in another Member State is a restriction of the freedoms conferred by Article\u00a045(1) of the Charter to every Union citizen (see, to that effect, concerning Article\u00a021(1) TFEU, judgments of 8\u00a0June 2017, \nFreitag\n, C-541/15, EU:C:2017:432, paragraph\u00a035 and the case-law cited, and of 19\u00a0November 2020, \nZW\n, C-454/19, EU:C:2020:947, paragraph\u00a030).\n278\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which applies the system provided for by the PNR Directive not only to extra-EU flights but also, pursuant to Article\u00a02(1) of that directive, to intra-EU flights as well as, beyond what is envisaged under that provision, to transport by other means within the European Union, results in the systematic and continuous transfer and processing of the PNR data of any passenger travelling by those means within the European Union while exercising his or her freedom of movement. \n279\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted in paragraphs\u00a098 to 111 above, the transfer and processing of data of passengers of extra-EU and intra-EU flights stemming from the system established by the PNR Directive entail undeniably serious interferences with the fundamental rights of the data subjects enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter. The seriousness of those interferences is even greater where the application of that system covers other means of transport within the European Union. Such interferences are, for the same reasons as those set out in those paragraphs, also such as to place at a disadvantage and, therefore, deter from exercising their freedom of movement, within the meaning of Article\u00a045 of the Charter, the nationals of the Member States which adopted such a legislation as well as, generally, Union citizens travelling by those means of transport within the European Union from or to those Member States, with the result that that legislation entails a restriction of that fundamental freedom.\n280\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with settled case-law, an obstacle to the freedom of movement of persons can be justified only where it is based on objective considerations and is proportionate to the legitimate objective of the national provisions. A measure is proportionate if, while appropriate for securing the attainment of the objective pursued, it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain that objective (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nComan and Others\n, C-673/16, EU:C:2018:385, paragraph\u00a041 and the case-law cited).\n281\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be added that a national measure that is liable to obstruct the exercise of freedom of movement for persons may be justified only where such a measure is consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter, it being the task of the Court to ensure that those rights are respected (judgment of 14\u00a0December 2021, \nStolichna obshtina, rayon \u2018Pancharevo\u2019\n, C-490/20, EU:C:2021:1008, paragraph\u00a058 and the case-law cited).\n282\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, in accordance with the case-law recalled in paragraphs\u00a0115 and 116 above, an objective of general interest may not be pursued without having regard to the fact that it must be reconciled with the fundamental rights affected by the measure, by properly balancing the objective of general interest against the rights at issue. In that regard, the possibility of Member States justifying a limitation of the right guaranteed in Article\u00a045(1) of the Charter must be assessed by measuring the seriousness of the interference which such a limitation entails and by verifying that the importance of the objective of general interest pursued by that limitation is proportionate to that seriousness.\n283\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As recalled in paragraph\u00a0122 above, the objective of combating terrorist offences and serious crime that the PNR Directive pursues is undoubtedly an objective of general interest of the European Union.\n284\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the question whether national legislation adopted for the purposes of transposing the PNR Directive that extends the system provided for by that directive to intra-EU flights and other modes of transport within the European Union is appropriate for securing the attainment of the objective pursued, it is apparent from the information in the file before the Court that use of PNR data allows identification of persons who were unsuspected of involvement in terrorist offences or serious crime and who should be subject to further examination, so that such legislation appears to be appropriate for the purpose of attaining the intended objective of combating terrorist offences and serious crime.\n285\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to whether such legislation is necessary, the exercise by the Member States of the power provided for in Article\u00a02(1) of the PNR Directive, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, must be limited to what is strictly necessary for securing the attainment of that objective in the light of the requirements mentioned in paragraphs\u00a0163 to 174 above.\n286\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those requirements apply, a fortiori, where the system provided for by the PNR Directive is applied to other means of transport within the European Union.\n287\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, as follows from the information in the request for a preliminary ruling, the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings transposes, in a single act, the PNR Directive, the API Directive and, in part, Directive 2010/65. To that end, it provides for the application of the system laid down in the PNR Directive to all intra-EU flights and transport by train, by road or even by sea carried out within the European Union departing from, going to or transiting through Belgium, and applies also to tour operators, while also pursuing objectives other than the fight against terrorist offences and serious crime. Following the said information, it appears that all the data collected in the context of the system established by that national legislation are retained by the PIU in a single database encompassing the PNR data, including the data covered by Article\u00a03(2) of the API Directive, for all the passengers of the transport operations covered by that legislation. \n288\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in so far as the referring court referred to the objective of improving border controls and combating illegal immigration in its Question 9(b), which is the objective of the API Directive, it should be borne in mind that, as follows from paragraphs\u00a0233, 234 and 237 above, the list of objectives pursued by the processing of PNR data under the PNR Directive is an exhaustive list with the result that national legislation authorising the processing of PNR data collected in accordance with that directive, for purposes other than those provided for therein, namely for the purposes of improving border controls and combating illegal immigration, is contrary to Article\u00a06 of the said directive, read in the light of the Charter.\n289\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, as is apparent from paragraph\u00a0235 above, Member States cannot create a single database containing both the PNR data collected under the PNR Directive and relating to extra-EU and intra-EU flights and the data of passengers of other means of transport as well as the data covered by Article\u00a03(2) of the API Directive, in particular where that database can be consulted not only for the purposes referred to in Article\u00a01(2) of the PNR Directive but for other purposes also. \n290\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly and in any event, as noted by the Advocate General in point\u00a0281 of his Opinion, Articles\u00a028 to 31 of the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016 can only be compatible with EU law, and with Article\u00a067(2) TFEU in particular, if they are interpreted and applied as relating only to the transfer and processing of the API data of passengers crossing Belgium\u2019s external borders with third countries. A measure whereby a Member State would extend the provisions of the API Directive, for the purposes of improving border controls and combating illegal immigration, to intra-EU and, a fortiori, other modes of transport carrying passengers within the European Union departing from, going to or transiting through that Member State, in particular the obligation to provide the data covered by Article\u00a03(1) of that directive, would amount to allowing the competent authorities, when internal borders of the said Member State are crossed, to ensure systematically that those passengers can be authorised to enter its territory or to leave it and would thus have an effect equivalent to the checks carried out at external borders with third countries.\n291\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of all of those considerations, the answer to Question 9(b) is that EU law, in particular Article\u00a02 of the PNR Directive, read in the light of Article\u00a03(2) TEU, Article\u00a067(2) TFEU and Article\u00a045 of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0national legislation which, in the absence of a genuine and present or foreseeable terrorist threat with which the Member State concerned is confronted, establishes a system for the transfer, by air carriers and tour operators, as well as for the processing, by the competent authorities, of the PNR data of all intra-EU flights and transport operations carried out by other means within the European Union and departing from, going to or transiting through that Member State, for the purposes of combating terrorist offences and serious crime. In such a situation, the application of the system established by the PNR Directive must be limited to the transfer and processing of the PNR data of flights and/or transport operations relating, inter alia, to certain routes or travel patterns or to certain airports, stations or seaports for which there are indications that are such as to justify that application. It is for the Member State concerned to select the intra-EU flights and/or the transport operations carried out by other means within the European Union for which there are such indications and to review regularly that application in accordance with changes in the circumstances that justified their selection, for the purposes of ensuring that the application of that system to those flights and/or those transport operations continues to be limited to what is strictly necessary, and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0national legislation providing for such a system for the transfer and processing of those data for the purposes of improving external border controls and combating illegal immigration.\nH.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nQuestion 10\n292\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its Question 10, the referring court asks, in essence, whether EU law must be interpreted as meaning that a national court may limit the temporal effects of a declaration of illegality which it is bound to make under national law in respect of national legislation requiring carriers by air, by rail and by land as well as tour operators to transfer PNR data, and providing for the processing and retention of those data, in breach of the provisions of the PNR Directive, read in the light of Article\u00a03(2) TEU, Article\u00a067(2) TFEU and Articles\u00a07, 8 and 45 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter.\n293\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principle of the primacy of EU law establishes the pre-eminence of EU law over the law of the Member States. That principle therefore requires all Member State bodies to give full effect to the various provisions of EU law, and the law of the Member States may not undermine the effect accorded to those various provisions in the territory of those States. In the light of that principle, where it is unable to interpret national legislation in compliance with the requirements of EU law, the national court which is called upon within the exercise of its jurisdiction to apply provisions of EU law is under a duty to give full effect to those provisions, if necessary refusing of its own motion to apply any conflicting provision of national legislation, even if adopted subsequently, and it is not necessary for that court to request or await the prior setting aside of such provision by legislative or other constitutional means (judgments of 15\u00a0July 1964, Costa, 6/64, EU:C:1964:66, pp.\u00a0593 and 594; of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, \nEU:C:2020:791\n, paragraphs\u00a0214 and 215; and of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0118).\n294\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only the Court may, in exceptional cases, on the basis of overriding considerations of legal certainty, allow the temporary suspension of the ousting effect of a rule of EU law with respect to national law that is contrary thereto. Such a restriction on the temporal effects of the interpretation of that law, made by the Court, may be granted only in the actual judgment ruling upon the interpretation requested. The primacy and uniform application of EU law would be undermined if national courts had the power to give provisions of national law primacy in relation to EU law contravened by those provisions, even temporarily (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0119 and the case-law cited).\n295\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike a breach of a procedural obligation such as the prior assessment of the impact of a project on the environment, at issue in the case that gave rise to the judgment of 29\u00a0July 2019, \nInter-Environnement Wallonie and Bond Beter Leefmilieu Vlaanderen\n (C-411/17, \nEU:C:2019:622\n, paragraphs\u00a0175, 176, 179 and 181), in which the Court accepted the temporary suspension of that ousting effect, a failure to comply with the provisions of the PNR Directive, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 45 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, cannot be remedied by a procedure comparable to the procedure allowed in that case. Maintaining the effects of national legislation such as the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016 would mean that that legislation would continue to impose on air carriers and other carriers as well as tour operators obligations which are contrary to EU law and which seriously interfere with the fundamental rights of the persons whose data have been transferred, retained and processed as well as restrictions on the freedom movement of those persons going beyond what is necessary (see, by analogy, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0122 and the case-law cited).\n296\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the referring court cannot limit the temporal effects of a declaration of illegality which it is bound to make under national law in respect of the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings (see, by analogy, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0123 and the case-law cited).\n297\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, in so far as the referring court raises the question of the impact of a finding of incompatibility, if any, of the Law of 25\u00a0December 2016 with the provisions of the PNR Directive, read in the light of the Charter, on the admissibility and use of the evidence and information secured from the data transferred by the carriers and tour operators concerned in the context of criminal proceedings, it suffices to refer to the Court\u2019s case-law on that subject, in particular to the principles recalled in paragraphs\u00a041 to 44 of the judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n (C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152), from which it follows that that admissibility is, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy of the Member States, a matter for national law, subject to compliance, inter alia, with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness (see, by analogy, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0127).\n298\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the Question 10 is that EU law must be interpreted as precluding a national court from limiting the temporal effects of a declaration of illegality which it is bound to make under national law in respect of national legislation requiring carriers by air, by rail and by road as well as tour operators to transfer PNR data, and providing for the processing and retention of those data, in breach of the provisions of the PNR Directive, read in the light of Article\u00a03(2) TEU, Article\u00a067(2) TFEU and Articles\u00a07, 8 and 45 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter. The admissibility of the evidence thus obtained is, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy of the Member States, a matter for national law, subject to compliance, inter alia, with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness.\nIV.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCosts\n299\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(2)(d) and Article\u00a023 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), must be interpreted as meaning that that regulation applies to the processing of personal data envisaged by national legislation intended to transpose, into domestic law, the provisions of Council Directive 2004/82/EC of 29\u00a0April 2004 on the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data, those of Directive 2010/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20\u00a0October 2010 on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States and repealing Directive 2002/6/EC and also those of Directive (EU) 2016/681 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the use of passenger name record (PNR) data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime, in respect of, on the one hand, data processing operations carried out by private operators and, on the other hand, data processing operations carried out by public authorities covered, solely or in addition, by Directive 2004/82 or Directive 2010/65. By contrast, the said regulation does not apply to the data processing operations envisaged by such legislation which are covered only by Directive 2016/681 and are carried out by the passenger information unit (PIU) or by the authorities competent for the purposes referred to in Article\u00a01(2) of that directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nGiven that an interpretation of Directive 2016/681 in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 21 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ensures that that directive is consistent with those articles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the examination of Questions 2 to 4 and Question 6 referred for a preliminary ruling has revealed nothing capable of affecting the validity of the said directive.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a06 of Directive 2016/681, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which authorises passenger name records (PNR data) collected in accordance with that directive to be processed for purposes other than those expressly referred to in Article\u00a01(2) of the said directive.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a012(3)(b) of Directive 2016/681 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation pursuant to which the authority put in place as the passenger information unit (PIU) is also designated as a competent national authority with power to approve the disclosure of PNR data upon expiry of the period of six months after the transfer of those data to the PIU.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a012(1) of Directive 2016/681, read in conjunction with Articles\u00a07 and 8 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides for a general retention period of five years for PNR data, applicable indiscriminately to all air passengers, including those for whom neither the advance assessment under Article\u00a06(2)(a) of that directive nor any verification carried out during the period of six months referred to in Article\u00a012(2) of the said directive nor any other circumstance have revealed the existence of objective evidence capable of establishing a risk that relates to terrorist offences or serious crime having an objective link, even if only an indirect one, with the carriage of passengers by air.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDirective 2004/82 must be interpreted as not applying to flights, whether scheduled or non-scheduled, carried out by an air carrier flying from the territory of a Member State and that are planned to land on the territory of one or more of the other Member States, without any stop-overs in the territory of a third country (intra-EU flights).\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEU law, in particular Article\u00a02 of Directive 2016/681, read in the light of Article\u00a03(2) TEU, Article\u00a067(2) TFEU and Article\u00a045 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must be interpreted as precluding:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nnational legislation which, in the absence of a genuine and present or foreseeable terrorist threat with which the Member State concerned is confronted, establishes a system for the transfer, by air carriers and tour operators, as well as for the processing, by the competent authorities, of the PNR data of all intra-EU flights and transport operations carried out by other means within the European Union, departing from, going to or transiting through that Member State, for the purposes of combating terrorist offences and serious crime. In such a situation, the application of the system established by Directive 2016/681 must be limited to the transfer and processing of the PNR data of flights and/or transport operations relating, inter alia, to certain routes or travel patterns or to certain airports, stations or seaports for which there are indications that are such as to justify that application. It is for the Member State concerned to select the intra-EU flights and/or the transport operations carried out by other means within the European Union for which there are such indications and to review regularly that application in accordance with changes in the circumstances that justified their selection, for the purposes of ensuring that the application of that system to those flights and/or those transport operations continues to be limited to what is strictly necessary, and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nnational legislation providing for such a system for the transfer and processing of those data for the purposes of improving external border controls and combating illegal immigration.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEU law must be interpreted as precluding a national court from limiting the temporal effects of a declaration of illegality which it is bound to make under national law in respect of national legislation requiring carriers by air, by rail and by road as well as tour operators to transfer PNR data, and providing for the processing and retention of those data, in breach of the provisions of Directive 2016/681, read in the light of Article\u00a03(2) TEU, Article\u00a067(2) TFEU, Articles\u00a07, 8 and 45 as well as Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law.

It also referred to a website that set out more information and further data processing purposes. It did not disclose to RW the identity of the specific recipients of the data.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RW brought proceedings against \u00d6sterreichische Post before the Austrian courts, seeking an order that \u00d6sterreichische Post provide him with, inter alia, the identity of the recipient(s) of the personal data disclosed.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the judicial proceedings thus initiated, \u00d6sterreichische Post informed RW that his personal data had been processed for marketing purposes and forwarded to customers, including advertisers trading via mail order and stationary outlets, IT companies, mailing list providers and associations such as charitable organisations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or political parties.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The courts at first instance and on appeal dismissed RW\u2019s action on the ground that Article\u00a015(1)(c) of the GDPR, by referring to \u2018recipients or categories of recipient\u2019, gives the controller the option of informing the data subject only of the categories of recipient, without having to identify by name the specific recipients to whom personal data are transferred.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RW brought an appeal on a point of law (\nRevision\n) before the Oberster Gerichtshof (Supreme Court, Austria), the referring court.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court is uncertain as to the interpretation of Article\u00a015(1)(c) of the GDPR, in so far as it is not clear from the wording of that provision whether it grants the data subject the right of access to information relating to the specific recipients of the disclosed data, or whether the controller has discretion as to how it proposes to respond to a request for access to information about the recipients.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court nevertheless observes that the underlying objective of that provision supports the interpretation that it is the data subject who has the option of requesting information about the categories of recipient or requesting information about the specific recipients of his or her personal data. In the referring court\u2019s view, any contrary interpretation would seriously undermine the effectiveness of the legal remedies available to the data subject for the protection of his or her data. If controllers had the option of informing data subjects of the specific recipients or only of the categories of recipient, the fear would be that, in practice, almost no controller would provide information about specific recipients.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, unlike Article\u00a013(1)(e) and Article\u00a014(1)(e) of the GDPR, which lay down an obligation on the part of the controller to provide the information set out in those articles, Article\u00a015(1) of that regulation focuses on the scope of the data subject\u2019s right of access, a fact which, according to the referring court, also tends to indicate that the data subject has the right to choose between requesting information about the specific recipients or about categories of recipient.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, the referring court adds that the right of access provided for in Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR covers not only personal data currently being processed but also all data processed previously. In that regard, it states that the considerations set out in the judgment of 7\u00a0May 2009, \nRijkeboer\n (C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293), based on the purpose of the right of access provided for by Directive 95/46, may be transferred to the right of access under Article\u00a015 of the GDPR, especially since it can be deduced from recitals\u00a09 and 10 of the GDPR that the EU legislature did not intend to reduce the level of protection as compared to that directive.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Oberster Gerichtshof (Supreme Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018Is Article\u00a015(1)(c) of [the GDPR] to be interpreted as meaning that the right of access is limited to information concerning categories of recipient where specific recipients have not yet been determined in the case of planned disclosures, but that right must necessarily also cover recipients of those disclosures in cases where data [have] already been disclosed?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the question referred\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a015(1)(c) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the data subject\u2019s right of access to personal data concerning him or her, provided for by that provision, entails, where those data have been or will be disclosed to recipients, an obligation on the part of the controller to provide the data subject with the specific identity of those recipients.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with settled case-law, the interpretation of a provision of EU law requires that account be taken not only of its wording, but also of its context and the objectives and purpose pursued by the act of which it forms part (judgment of 15\u00a0March 2022, \nAutorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers\n, C-302/20, EU:C:2022:190, paragraph\u00a063). Furthermore, where a provision of EU law is open to several interpretations, preference must be given to that interpretation which ensures that the provision retains its effectiveness (judgment of 7\u00a0March 2018, \nCristal Union\n, C-31/17, EU:C:2018:168, paragraph\u00a041 and the case-law cited).\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, first of all, the wording of Article\u00a015(1)(c) of the GDPR, that provision states that the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and information about the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that the terms \u2018recipients\u2019 and \u2018categories of recipient\u2019 in that provision are used in succession, without it being possible to infer an order of priority between them.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is thus clear that the wording of Article\u00a015(1)(c) of the GDPR does not make it possible to determine unequivocally whether the data subject would have the right to be informed, when personal data concerning him or her have been or will be disclosed, of the specific identity of the recipients of the data.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, as regards the context of Article\u00a015(1)(c) of the GDPR, it should be pointed out, in the first place, that recital\u00a063 of that regulation states that the data subject is to have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the recipients of the personal data and does not state that that right may be restricted solely to categories of recipient, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a023 of his Opinion.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it should also be borne in mind that, in order to respect the right of access, all processing of personal data of natural persons must comply with the principles set out in Article\u00a05 of the GDPR (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0January 2019, \nDeutsche Post\n, C-496/17, EU:C:2019:26, paragraph\u00a057).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those principles include the principle of transparency set out in Article\u00a05(1)(a) of the GDPR, which, as is clear from recital\u00a039 of that regulation, requires that the data subject have information about how his or her personal data are processed and that that information be easily accessible and easy to understand.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, it should be noted, as the Advocate General stated in point\u00a021 of his Opinion, that, unlike Articles\u00a013 and 14 of the GDPR, which lay down an obligation on the part of the controller to provide the data subject with information relating to the categories of recipient or the specific recipients of the personal data concerning him or her where personal data are collected from the data subject and where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, Article\u00a015 of the GDPR lays down a genuine right of access for the data subject, with the result that the data subject must have the option of obtaining either information about the specific recipients to whom the data have been or will be disclosed, where possible, or information about the categories of recipient.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fourth place, the Court has previously held that the exercise of that right of access must enable the data subject to verify not only that the data concerning him or her are correct, but also that they are processed in a lawful manner (see, by analogy, judgments of 17\u00a0July 2014, \nYS and Others\n, C-141/12 and C-372/12, EU:C:2014:2081, paragraph\u00a044, and of 20\u00a0December 2017, \nNowak\n, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraph\u00a057), and in particular that they have been disclosed to authorised recipients (see, by analogy, judgment of 7\u00a0May 2009, \nRijkeboer\n, C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293, paragraph\u00a049).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, that right of access is necessary to enable the data subject to exercise, depending on the circumstances, his or her right to rectification, right to erasure (\u2018right to be forgotten\u2019) or right to restriction of processing, conferred, respectively, by Articles\u00a016, 17 and 18 of the GDPR (see, by analogy, judgments of 17\u00a0July 2014, \nYS and Others\n, C-141/12 and C-372/12, EU:C:2014:2081, paragraph\u00a044, and of 20\u00a0December 2017, \nNowak\n, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraph\u00a057), and the data subject\u2019s right to object to his or her personal data being processed, laid down in Article\u00a021 of the GDPR, and right of action where he or she suffers damage, laid down in Articles\u00a079 and 82 of the GDPR (see, by analogy, judgment of 7\u00a0May 2009, \nRijkeboer\n, C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293, paragraph\u00a052).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in order to ensure the effectiveness of all of the rights referred to in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment, the data subject must have, in particular, the right to be informed of the identity of the specific recipients where his or her personal data have already been disclosed.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such an interpretation is confirmed, in the fifth and last place, by a reading of Article\u00a019 of the GDPR, which provides, in its first sentence, that the controller is, in principle, to communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed and, in its second sentence, that the controller is to inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject requests it.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the second sentence of Article\u00a019 of the GDPR expressly confers on the data subject the right to be informed of the specific recipients of the data concerning him or her by the controller, in the context of the controller\u2019s obligation to inform all the recipients of the exercise of the data subject\u2019s rights under Article\u00a016, Article\u00a017(1) and Article\u00a018 of the GDPR.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the above contextual analysis that Article\u00a015(1)(c) of the GDPR is one of the provisions intended to ensure transparency vis-\u00e0-vis the data subject of the manner in which personal data are processed and enables that person, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a033 of his Opinion, to exercise the rights laid down, inter alia, in Articles\u00a016 to 19, 21, 79 and 82 of the GDPR.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the information provided to the data subject pursuant to the right of access provided for in Article\u00a015(1)(c) of the GDPR must be as precise as possible. In particular, that right of access entails the ability of the data subject to obtain from the controller information about the specific recipients to whom the data have been or will be disclosed or, alternatively, to elect merely to request information concerning the categories of recipient.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, as regards the purpose of the GDPR, it should be pointed out that its purpose is, inter alia, as is apparent from recital\u00a010 of that regulation, to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0207). In that regard, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point\u00a014 of his Opinion, the general legal framework created by the GDPR implements the requirements arising from the fundamental right, protected by Article\u00a08 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, to the protection of personal data, in particular the requirements expressly laid down in Article\u00a08(2) thereof (see, to that effect, judgment of 9\u00a0March 2017, \nManni\n, C-398/15, EU:C:2017:197, paragraph\u00a040).\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That objective supports the interpretation of Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR set out in paragraph\u00a043 above.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it also follows from the objective pursued by the GDPR that the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller information about the specific recipients to whom the personal data concerning him or her have been or will be disclosed.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, it must, lastly, be emphasised that, as is apparent from recital\u00a04 of the GDPR, the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right. That right must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, as the Court reaffirmed, in essence, in paragraph\u00a0172 of the judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n (C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it may be accepted that, in specific circumstances, it is not possible to provide information about specific recipients. Therefore, the right of access may be restricted to information about categories of recipient if it is impossible to disclose the identity of specific recipients, in particular where they are not yet known.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it should be borne in mind that, under Article\u00a012(5)(b) of the GDPR, the controller may, pursuant to the principle of responsibility referred to in Article\u00a05(2) and recital\u00a074 of that regulation, refuse to act on requests from a data subject where those requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, it being specified that it is for the controller to demonstrate that those requests are unfounded or excessive.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling that \u00d6sterreichische Post refused the request made by RW under Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR to be informed of the identity of the recipients to whom \u00d6sterreichische Post had disclosed the personal data concerning him. It will be for the referring court to determine whether, in the light of the circumstances of the main proceedings, \u00d6sterreichische Post has demonstrated that that request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred for a preliminary ruling is that Article\u00a015(1)(c) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the data subject\u2019s right of access to personal data concerning him or her, provided for by that provision, entails, where those data have been or will be disclosed to recipients, an obligation on the part of the controller to provide the data subject with the actual identity of those recipients, unless it is impossible to identify those recipients or the controller demonstrates that the data subject\u2019s requests for access are manifestly unfounded or excessive within the meaning of Article\u00a012(5) of the GDPR, in which cases the controller may indicate to the data subject only the categories of recipient in question.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a015(1)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation),\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the data subject\u2019s right of access to the personal data concerning him or her, provided for by that provision, entails, where those data have been or will be disclosed to recipients, an obligation on the part of the controller to provide the data subject with the actual identity of those recipients, unless it is impossible to identify those recipients or the controller demonstrates that the data subject\u2019s requests for access are manifestly unfounded or excessive within the meaning of Article\u00a012(5) of Regulation 2016/679, in which cases the controller may indicate to the data subject only the categories of recipient in question."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Such an order may be made at the request of an author or a successor in title of an author or a person who, on the basis of a licence, is entitled to exploit the work. It may be made only if the information can be regarded as facilitating the investigation into an infringement concerning the goods or services.\nThe obligation to disclose information applies to any person who\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has carried out or contributed to the infringement, \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has, on a commercial scale, exploited the goods affected by the infringement,\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has, on a commercial scale, exploited a service affected by the infringement, \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has, on a commercial scale, provided an electronic communications service or another service used in the infringement, or\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has been identified by a person referred to in points (2) to (4) as participating in the production or distribution of goods or the supply of services affected by the infringement.\nInformation on the origin or distribution network of goods or services may include, inter alia\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the name and address of producers, distributors, suppliers and others who have held the goods or supplied the services,\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the names and addresses of intended wholesalers and retailers, and\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0information concerning the quantities produced, supplied, received or ordered and the price fixed for the goods or services. \nThe provisions in the first to third subparagraphs above also apply to attempts or preparations made to commit infringements referred to in Paragraph 53.\u2019 \n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 53d of that Law provides:\n\u2018An order for disclosure of information may be made only if the reasons for the measure outweigh the nuisance or other harm which the measure entails for the person affected by it or for some other conflicting interest. \nThe obligation to disclose information under Paragraph 53c does not cover information disclosure of which would reveal that the person disclosing that information or persons close to him within the meaning of Chapter 36, Paragraph\u00a03, of the Code of Judicial Procedure (r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken) has committed a criminal act. \nThere are provisions in the Law (1998:204) on personal data (personuppgiftslagen (1998:204)) which restrict the manner in which personal data received may be handled.\u2019 \n\u00a0Protection of personal data \n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2002/58 was transposed into Swedish law in particular by Law (2003:389) on electronic communications (lagen (2003:389) om elektronisk kommunikation).\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the first sentence of Paragraph 20 of that Law, a person who, in connection with the provision of an electronic communications network or an electronic communications service, has acquired or been given access to, inter alia, data on subscriptions may not without authorisation disseminate or exploit the data which he has acquired or to which he has been given access.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national court notes in that regard that the obligation of confidentiality to which internet service providers in particular are subject has been conceived to prohibit only unauthorised disclosure or use of certain data. However, that obligation of confidentiality is relative, since other provisions require that information to be disclosed, which means that such disclosure is not unauthorised. According to the H\u00f6gsta domstolen, the right to information provided for in Paragraph\u00a053c of the Law on copyright, which also applies to internet service providers, was deemed not to require the implementation of specific legislative changes in order to enable the new provisions relating to disclosure of personal data to take precedence over the obligation of confidentiality. The obligation of confidentiality is therefore overridden by the court\u2019s decision on an order for disclosure of information. \n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2006/24 has not been transposed into Swedish law within the time-limit prescribed. \n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling \n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicants in the main proceedings are publishing companies which hold, inter alia, exclusive rights to the reproduction, publishing and distribution to the public of 27 works in the form of audio books.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They claim that their exclusive rights have been infringed by the public distribution of these 27 works, without their consent, by means of an FTP (\u2018file transfer protocol\u2019) server which allows file sharing and data transfer between computers connected to the internet.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The internet service provider through which the alleged illegal file exchange took place is ePhone.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicants in the main proceedings applied to Solna tingsr\u00e4tten (Solna District Court) for an order for the disclosure of data for the purpose of communicating the name and address of the person using the IP address from which it is assumed that the files in question were sent during the period between 03:28 and 05:45 on 1\u00a0April 2009.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The service provider, ePhone, challenged this application, arguing in particular that the injunction sought is contrary to Directive 2006/24.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At first instance, Solna tingsr\u00e4tten granted the application for an order for the disclosure of the data in question.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ePhone brought an appeal before Svea hovr\u00e4tten (Stockholm Court of Appeal), seeking dismissal of the application for the order for the disclosure. It also requested a referral to the Court of Justice seeking clarification of whether Directive 2006/24 precludes the disclosure to persons other than the authorities referred to in the directive of information relating to a subscriber to whom an IP address has been allocated.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Svea hovr\u00e4tten held that there is no provision in Directive 2006/24 which precludes a party to a civil dispute from being ordered to disclose subscriber data to someone other than a public authority. It also dismissed the application for a referral to the Court of Justice. \n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Svea hovr\u00e4tten also found that the audio book publishers had not adduced clear evidence that there was an infringement of an intellectual property right. It therefore decided to set aside the order for disclosure of data granted by Solna tingsr\u00e4tten. The applicants in the main proceedings then appealed to the H\u00f6gsta domstolen.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The H\u00f6gsta domstolen is of the opinion that, notwithstanding the judgment in Case C-275/06 \nPromusicae \n[2008] ECR I-271 and the order in Case C-557/07 \nLSG-Gesellschaft zur Wahrnehmung von Leistungsschutzrechten\n [2009] ECR I-1227, doubts remain as to whether European Union law precludes the application of Article\u00a053c of the Swedish Law on copyright, in so far as neither that judgment nor that order makes reference to Directive 2006/24. \n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the H\u00f6gsta domstolen decided to stay the proceedings and refer to the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does [Directive 2006/24], and in particular Articles 3 [to] 5 and 11 thereof, preclude the application of a national provision which is based on Article\u00a08 of [Directive 2004/48] and which permits an internet service provider in civil proceedings, in order to identify a particular subscriber, to be ordered to give a copyright holder or its representative information on the subscriber to whom the internet service provider provided a specific IP address, which address, it is claimed, was used in the infringement? The question is based on the assumption that the applicant has adduced clear evidence of the infringement of a particular copyright and that the measure is proportionate.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the answer to Question 1 affected by the fact that the Member State has not implemented [Directive 2006/24] despite the fact that the period prescribed for implementation has expired?\u2019 \n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred \n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its two questions, which it is appropriate to consider together, the national court asks, in essence, whether Directive 2006/24 is to be interpreted as precluding the application of a national provision based on Article\u00a08 of [Directive 2004/48] which, in order to identify a particular subscriber, permits an internet service provider in civil proceedings to be ordered to give a copyright holder or its representative information on the subscriber to whom the internet service provider provided an IP address which was allegedly used in the infringement, and whether the fact that the Member State concerned has not yet transposed Directive 2006/24, despite the period for doing so having expired, affects the answer to that question.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it must be noted, firstly, that the Court is starting from the premiss that the data at issue in the main proceedings have been retained in accordance with national legislation, in compliance with the conditions laid down in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, a matter which it is for the national court to ascertain.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, Directive 2006/24, according to Article\u00a01(1) thereof, aims to harmonise Member States\u2019 provisions concerning the obligations of the providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks with respect to the retention of certain data which are generated or processed by them, in order to ensure that the data are available for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each Member State in its national law. \n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as follows from Article\u00a04 of Directive 2006/24, the data retained in accordance with that directive are to be provided only to the competent national authorities in specific cases and in accordance with the national law concerned.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, Directive 2006/24 deals exclusively with the handling and retention of data generated or processed by the providers of publicly available electronic communications services or public communications networks for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime and their communication to the competent national authorities. \n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The material scope of Directive 2006/24 thus stated is confirmed by Article\u00a011 thereof which states that, if such data were retained specifically for the purposes of Article\u00a01(1) of the directive, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 does not apply to those data.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as is apparent from recital 12 in the preamble to Directive 2006/24, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC continues to apply to data retained for purposes, including judicial purposes, other than those referred to expressly in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2006/24. \n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it follows from a combined reading of Article\u00a011 and recital 12 of Directive 2006/24 that that directive constitutes a special and restricted set of rules, derogating from and replacing Directive 2002/58 general in scope and, in particular, Article\u00a015(1) thereof.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the main proceedings, it must be noted that the legislation at issue pursues an objective different from that pursued by Directive 2006/24. It concerns the communication of data, in civil proceedings, in order to obtain a declaration that there has been an infringement of intellectual property rights. \n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That legislation does not, therefore, fall within the material scope of Directive 2006/24.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it is irrelevant to the main proceedings that the Member State concerned has not yet transposed Directive 2006/24, despite the period for doing so having expired. \n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None the less, in order to provide a satisfactory answer to the national court which has referred a question to it, the Court of Justice may also deem it necessary to consider provisions of European Union law to which the national court has not referred in its question (see, inter alia, Case C-107/98 \nTeckal\n [1999] ECR I-8121, paragraph 39, and Case C-2/07 \nAbraham and Others\n [2008] ECR I-1197, paragraph 24).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be noted that the facts in the main proceedings lend themselves to such rules of European Union law being taken into consideration. \n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reference made by the national court, in its first question, to compliance with the requirement for clear evidence of an infringement of a copyright and to the proportionate nature of the injunction which would be issued under the transposing law at issue in the main proceedings and, as follows from paragraph 34 of the present judgment, to the judgment in \nPromusicae\n, suggests that the national court is also doubtful as to whether the provisions in question of that transposing law are likely to ensure a fair balance between the various applicable fundamental rights, as required by that judgment, which interpreted and applied various provisions of Directives 2002/58 and 2004/48.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the answer to such an implied question may be relevant to the resolution of the case in the main proceedings.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to give a useful answer, firstly, it is necessary to bear in mind that the applicants in the main proceedings seek the communication of the name and address of an internet subscriber or user using the IP address from which it is presumed that an unlawful exchange of files containing protected works took place, in order to identify that person.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be held that the communication sought by the applicants in the main proceedings constitutes the processing of personal data within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article\u00a02 of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46. That communication therefore falls within the scope of Directive 2002/58 (see, to that effect, \nPromusicae\n, paragraph 45). \n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must also be noted that, in the main proceedings, the communication of those data is required in civil proceedings for the benefit of a copyright holder or his successor in title, that is to say, a private person, and not for the benefit of a competent national authority.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be stated at the outset that an application for communication of personal data in order to ensure effective protection of copyright falls, by its very object, within the scope of Directive 2004/48 (see, to that effect, \nPromusicae\n, paragraph 58). \n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already held that Article\u00a08(3) of Directive\u00a02004/48, read in conjunction with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive\u00a02002/58, does not preclude Member States from imposing an obligation to disclose to private persons personal data in order to enable them to bring civil proceedings for copyright infringements, but nor does it require those Member States to lay down such an obligation (see \nPromusicae\n, paragraphs 54 and 55, and order in \nLSG-Gesellschaft zur Wahrnehmung von Leistungsschutzrechten\n, paragraph 29). \n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the Court pointed out that, when transposing, inter alia, Directives\u00a02002/58 and 2004/48 into national law, it is for the Member States to ensure that they rely on an interpretation of those directives which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the European Union legal order. Furthermore, when implementing the measures transposing those directives, the authorities and courts of Member States must not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with them, but must also make sure that they do not rely on an interpretation of them which would conflict with those fundamental rights or with the other general principles of European Union law, such as the principle of proportionality (see, to that effect, \nPromusicae\n, paragraph\u00a068, and order in \nLSG-Gesellschaft zur Wahrnehmung von Leistungsschutzrechten\n, paragraph 28).\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the Member State concerned has decided to make use of the possibility available to it, as described in paragraph 55 of this judgment, to lay down an obligation to communicate personal data to private persons in civil proceedings.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be noted that the national legislation in question requires, inter alia, that, for an order for disclosure of the data in question to be made, there be clear evidence of an infringement of an intellectual property right, that the information can be regarded as facilitating the investigation into an infringement of copyright or impairment of such a right and that the reasons for the measure outweigh the nuisance or other harm which the measure may entail for the person affected by it or for some other conflicting interest.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, that legislation enables the national court seised of an application for an order for disclosure of personal data, made by a person who is entitled to act, to weigh the conflicting interests involved, on the basis of the facts of each case and taking due account of the requirements of the principle of proportionality.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, such legislation must be regarded as likely, in principle, to ensure a fair balance between the protection of intellectual property rights enjoyed by copyright holders and the protection of personal data enjoyed by internet subscribers or users.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the foregoing, the answer to the questions referred is that:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2006/24 must be interpreted as not precluding the application of national legislation based on Article\u00a08 of Directive 2004/48 which, in order to identify an internet subscriber or user, permits an internet service provider in civil proceedings to be ordered to give a copyright holder or its representative information on the subscriber to whom the internet service provider provided an IP address which was allegedly used in an infringement, since that legislation does not fall within the material scope of Directive 2006/24;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0it is irrelevant to the main proceedings that the Member State concerned has not yet transposed Directive 2006/24, despite the period for doing so having expired;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directives 2002/58 and 2004/48 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings insofar as that legislation enables the national court seised of an application for an order for disclosure of personal data, made by a person who is entitled to act, to weigh the conflicting interests involved, on the basis of the facts of each case and taking due account of the requirements of the principle of proportionality.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\nDirective 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\u00a0March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC must be interpreted as not precluding the application of national legislation based on Article\u00a08 of Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights which, in order to identify an internet subscriber or user, permits an internet service provider in civil proceedings to be ordered to give a copyright holder or its representative information on the subscriber to whom the internet service provider provided an IP address which was allegedly used in an infringement, since that legislation does not fall within the material scope of Directive 2006/24.\nIt is irrelevant to the main proceedings that the Member State concerned has not yet transposed Directive 2006/24, despite the period for doing so having expired.\nDirectives 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) and 2004/48 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings insofar as that legislation enables the national court seised of an application for an order for disclosure of personal data, made by a person who is entitled to act, to weigh the conflicting interests involved, on the basis of the facts of each case and taking due account of the requirements of the principle of proportionality."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 10 Jul 2018, C-25/17 (\nJehovan todistajat\n)\nGeneral data protection

law\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a010, 12, 15, 26 and 27 of Directive 95/46 state:\n\u2018(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the object of the national laws on the processing of personal data is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, which is recognised both in Article\u00a08 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms[, signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950,] and in the general principles of Community law; whereas, for that reason, the approximation of those laws must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community;\n\u2026\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the protection principles must apply to all processing of personal data by any person whose activities are governed by Community law; whereas there should be excluded the processing of data carried out by a natural person in the exercise of activities which are exclusively personal or domestic, such as correspondence and the holding of records of addresses;\n\u2026\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the processing of such data is covered by this Directive only if it is automated or if the data processed are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system structured according to specific criteria relating to individuals, so as to permit easy access to the personal data in question;\n\u2026\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the principles of protection must apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable person; whereas, to determine whether a person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said person; \u2026\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the protection of individuals must apply as much to automatic processing of data as to manual processing; whereas the scope of this protection must not in effect depend on the techniques used, otherwise this would create a serious risk of circumvention; whereas, nonetheless, as regards manual processing, this Directive covers only filing systems, not unstructured files; whereas, in particular, the content of a filing system must be structured according to specific criteria relating to individuals allowing easy access to the personal data; whereas, in line with the definition in Article\u00a02(c), the different criteria for determining the constituents of a structured set of personal data, and the different criteria governing access to such a set, may be laid down by each Member State; whereas files or sets of files as well as their cover pages, which are not structured according to specific criteria, shall under no circumstances fall within the scope of this Directive\u2019.\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 95/46 provides:\n\u2018In accordance with this Directive,

henkil\u00f6tietolaki 523/1999 (Law on personal data No\u00a0523/1999, \u2018Law No\u00a0523/1999\u2019).\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph\u00a02, first and second paragraphs, of that law, entitled \u2018Soveltamisala\u2019 (Scope), provides;\n\u2018This Law applies to the automated processing of personal data. It also applies to other means of personal data processing where the personal data form part of a personal data filing system or a part of such a system or are intended to form part of a personal data filing system or a part of such a system.\nThis Law does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person for purely personal purposes or for comparable ordinary and private purposes.\u2019\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph\u00a03(3) of Law No\u00a0523/1999 defines a \u2018personal data filing system\u2019 as a \u2018set of personal data, connected by a common use and processed fully or partially by automated means or organised using data sheets or lists or any other comparable means permitting the retrieval of data relating to persons easily and without excessive cost\u2019.\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Paragraph\u00a044 of that law, at the request of the Data Protection Supervisor, the Data Protection Board may prohibit processing of personal data that is contrary to that law or to the rules and regulations issued on the basis thereof, and order the parties concerned to remedy the unlawful conduct or negligence within a prescribed period.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 17\u00a0September 2013, at the request of the Data Protection Supervisor the Finnish Data Protection Board adopted a decision prohibiting the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community from collecting or processing personal data in the course of door-to-door preaching carried out by its members unless the legal requirements for processing such data laid down, in particular, in Paragraphs\u00a08 and 12 of the Law No\u00a0523/1999 were satisfied. Furthermore, on the basis of Paragraph\u00a044(2) of that law, the Data Protection Board imposed a ban on the collection of personal data by the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community for the purposes of that community for a period of six months unless those conditions were observed.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the grounds for its decision, the Data Protection Board considered that the collection of the data at issue by members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community constituted processing of personal data within the meaning of that law, and that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community and its members were both data controllers.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community brought an action before the Helsingin hallinto-oikeus (Administrative Court, Helsinki, Finland) against that decision. By judgment of 18\u00a0December 2014, that court annulled the decision on the ground, inter alia, that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community was not a controller of personal data within the meaning of Law No\u00a0523/1999 and that its activity did not constitute unlawful processing of such data.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Data Protection Supervisor challenged that judgment before the Korkein hallinto-oikeus (Supreme Administrative Court, Finland).\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the findings of that court, the members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community take notes in the course of their door-to-door preaching about visits to persons who are unknown to themselves or that Community. The data collected may consist, among other things, of the name and addresses of persons contacted, together with information concerning their religious beliefs and their family circumstances. Those data are collected as a memory aid and in order to be retrieved for any subsequent visit without the knowledge or consent of the persons concerned.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court also found that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community has given its members guidelines on the taking of such notes which appear in at least one of its magazines which is dedicated to preaching. That community and its congregations organise and coordinate the door-to-door preaching by their members, in particular by creating maps from which areas are allocated between the members who engage in preaching and by keeping records about preachers and the number of the Community\u2019s publications distributed by them. Furthermore, the congregations of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community maintain a list of persons who have requested not to receive visits from preachers and the personal data on that list, called the \u2018refusal register\u2019, are used by members of that community. Lastly, the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community has, in the past, made forms available to its members for the purpose of collecting those data in the course of their preaching. However, the use of those forms was abandoned following a recommendation by the Data Protection Supervisor.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court observes that, according to information from the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community, it does not require members who engage in preaching to collect data, and that in cases in which such data has been collected it has no knowledge of either the nature of the notes taken which are, moreover, only informal personal notes nor of the identity of the preachers who collected those data.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the need for the present request for a preliminary ruling, the Korkein hallinto-oikeus (Supreme Administrative Court) takes the view that the examination of the case in the main proceedings requires consideration to be given, on one hand, to the rights to privacy and protection of personal data and, on the other, to freedom of religion and association guaranteed by the Charter and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as well as the Finnish Constitution.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court considers that the door-to-door preaching practised by members of a religious community, such as the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community, is not one of the activities excluded from the scope of Directive 95/46, by virtue of the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) thereof. However, the question arises as to whether that activity is a purely personal or household activity within the meaning of the second indent of Article\u00a03(2). In that regard, account must be taken of the fact that, in the present case, the data collected are more than informal notes in an address book, as the notes taken concern unknown persons and contain sensitive data relating to their religious beliefs. The fact that door-to-door preaching is an essential part of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community\u2019s activity, which is organised and coordinated by it and by its congregations, must also be taken into consideration.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, since the collected data at issue in the main proceedings are processed otherwise than by automatic means, it must be determined, having regard to Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 95/46 read together with Article\u00a02(c) thereof, whether that set of data constitutes a filing system within the meaning of those provisions. According to the information provided by the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community, those data are not shared, so that it is impossible to know with certainty the nature and extent of the data collected. However, it may be assumed that the purpose of collecting and subsequent processing of the data at issue in the main proceedings is for the easy retrieval of that data concerning a specific person or address for the purposes of a subsequent visit. The data collected are not, however, structured in the form of data sheets.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the data processing at issue in the main proceedings falls within the scope of Directive 95/46, the referring court notes that the question then arises as to whether the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community must be regarded as a controller of that processing within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) thereof. The case-law of the Court deriving from the judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n (C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317), broadly defines the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of those provisions. Furthermore, it is clear from Opinion 1/2010 of 16\u00a0February 2010 on the concepts of \u2018controller\u2019 and \u2018processor\u2019 produced by the Working Group set up pursuant to Article\u00a029 of Directive 95/46, that, in particular, the \u2018effective control\u2019 and the conception that the data subject has of the controller must be taken into account.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, regard should be had to the fact that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community organises, coordinates and encourages door-to-door preaching, and that in its publications it has given guidelines on the collection of data in the course of that activity. Furthermore, the Data Protection Supervisor found that that community has effective control over the means of data processing and the power to prohibit or limit that processing, and that it previously defined the purpose and means of data collection by giving guidelines on collection. Furthermore, the forms previously used are also evidence of the active involvement of that community in data processing.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, account should also be taken of the fact that the members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community can decide themselves whether to collect data and to determine the means of doing so. Furthermore, that community does not itself collect data and does not have access to the data collected by its members, except that on the \u2018refusal\u2019 list. However, such circumstances do not preclude the potential for several data controllers, each with different roles and responsibilities.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the Korkein hallinto-oikeus (Supreme Administrative Court) decided to stay the proceedings before it and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the exceptions to the scope of [Directive 95/46] laid down in Article\u00a03(2), first and second indents, thereof be interpreted as meaning that the collection and other processing of personal data carried out by the members of a religious community in connection with door-to-door preaching fall outside the scope of that directive? When assessing the applicability of [Directive 95/46], what significance is to be given, on one hand, to the fact that it is the religious community and its congregations which organise the preaching activity in the course of which the data is collected and, on the other, to the fact this also concerns the personal religious practice of the members of a religious community?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the definition of a \u201cfiling system\u201d in Article\u00a02(c) of \u2026 Directive [95/46], examined in the light of recitals\u00a026 and 27 of that directive, be interpreted as meaning that, taken as a whole, the personal data (consisting of names and addresses and other information about and characteristics of a person) collected otherwise than by automatic means in connection with the door-to-door preaching described above\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0does not constitute such a filing system, because the data does not include specific lists or data sheets or any other comparable search method as provided for in the definition laid down in the [Law No\u00a0523/1999], or\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0does constitute such a filing system, because, taking account of its intended purpose, the information required for later use may in practice be searched easily and without unreasonable expense in accordance with [Law No\u00a0523/1999]?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the phrase \u201calone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data\u201d appearing in Article\u00a02(d) of \u2026 Directive [95/46] be interpreted as meaning that a religious community that organises an activity in the course of which personal data is collected (in particular, by allocating areas in which the activity is carried out among the various preachers, supervising the activity of those preachers and keeping a list of individuals who do not wish the preachers to visit them) may be regarded as a controller, in respect of the processing of personal data carried out by its members, even if the religious community claims that only the individual members who engage in preaching have access to the data that they gather?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article\u00a02(d) of Directive [95/46] be interpreted to the effect that in order for a religious community to be considered a controller it must have taken other specific measures, such as giving written instructions or orders directing the collection of data, or is it sufficient that that religious community can be regarded as having de facto control of its members\u2019 activities?\nIt is necessary to answer Questions 3 and 4 only if, on the basis of the answers to Questions 1 and 2, [Directive 95/46] is applicable. It is necessary to answer Question 4 only if, on the basis of Question 3, the application of Article\u00a02(d) of [Directive 95/46] to the Community cannot be regarded as being excluded.\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe request to have the oral procedure reopened\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By two documents lodged at the Court Registry on 12\u00a0December 2017 and 15\u00a0February 2018 respectively, the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community requested the Court to order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure pursuant to Article\u00a083 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court. In support of the first of those requests, the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community claims, in particular, that it did not have the opportunity at the hearing to respond to the observations submitted by the other parties, some of which did not reflect the facts in the main proceedings. As regards the second request, the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community argues essentially that the Opinion of the Advocate General is based on inaccurate or potentially misleading facts, some of which are not mentioned in the request for a preliminary ruling.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Article\u00a083 of its Rules of Procedure, the Court may at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to have a decisive bearing on the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article\u00a023 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is not the case here. In particular, the requests of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community seeking to have the oral procedure reopened do not contain any new argument on the basis of which the present case should be decided. Furthermore, that party and the other interested parties referred to in Article\u00a023 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union submitted, both during the written phase and the oral phase of the proceedings, their observations concerning the interpretation of Article\u00a02(c) and (d), and Article\u00a03 of Directive 95/46, read in the light of Article\u00a010 of the Charter, which is the subject of the questions referred for a preliminary ruling.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the facts in the main proceedings, it must be recalled that in proceedings under Article\u00a0267 TFEU, only the court making the reference may define the factual context in which the questions which it asks arise or, at very least, explain the factual assumptions on which the questions are based. It follows that a party to the main proceedings cannot allege that certain factual premisses on which the arguments advanced by the other interested parties referred to in Article\u00a023 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union are based, or the analysis of the Advocate General, are incorrect in order to justify the reopening of the oral procedure, on the basis of Article\u00a083 of the Rules of Procedure (see, to that effect, judgment of 26\u00a0June 2008, \nBurda\n, C-284/06, EU:C:2008:365, paragraphs\u00a044, 45 and 47).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against that background, the Court, having heard the Advocate General, considers that it has all the evidence necessary to enable it to reply to the questions referred and that the present case does not thereby fall to be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties. The request to reopen the oral procedure must therefore be rejected.\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility of the request for a preliminary ruling\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community claims that the request for a preliminary ruling is inadmissible. While challenging the main facts on which that request is based, it claims that the request for a preliminary ruling relates to the conduct of some of its members who are not parties to the main proceedings. Therefore, that request concerns a hypothetical problem.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it is solely for the national court hearing the case, which has the responsibility of taking the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, with regard to the particular aspects of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it refers to the Court. Consequently, where the questions put by national courts concern the interpretation of a provision of European Union law, the Court is, in principle, bound to give a ruling. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (see, to that effect, judgment of 27\u00a0June 2017, \nCongregaci\u00f3n de Escuelas P\u00edas Provincia Betania\n, C-74/16, EU:C:2017:496, paragraphs\u00a024 and 25 and the case-law cited).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the order for reference contains sufficient factual and legal information to understand both the questions referred for a preliminary ruling and their scope. Further, and most importantly, nothing in the file leads to the conclusion that the interpretation requested of EU law is unrelated to the actual facts of the main action or its object, or that the problem is hypothetical, in particular on account of the fact that the members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community whose collection of personal data is the basis for the questions referred are not parties to the main proceedings. It is clear from the order for reference that the questions referred are intended to assist the referring court to determine whether that community may itself be regarded as a controller, within the meaning of Directive 95/46, in connection with the collection of the personal data by its members in the course of their door-to-door preaching activities.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reference for a preliminary ruling is therefore admissible.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks essentially whether Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, read in the light of Article\u00a010(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that the collection of personal data by members of a religious community in the course of door-to-door preaching and the subsequent processing of those data constitutes the processing of personal data carried out for the purposes of the activities referred to in Article\u00a03(2), first indent, of that directive or the processing of personal data carried out by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity within the meaning of Article\u00a03(2), second indent, thereof.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer that question, it should be observed from the outset, as is clear from Article\u00a01(1) and recital\u00a010 of Directive 95/46, that that directive seeks to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data (judgments of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a066, and of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtshaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraph\u00a026).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03 of Directive 95/46, which defines the scope of the directive, states in paragraph\u00a01 that its provisions \u2018shall apply to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means, and to the processing otherwise than by automatic means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system\u2019.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Article\u00a03(2) lays down two exceptions to the scope of application of that directive which must be strictly interpreted (see, to that effect, judgments of 11\u00a0December 2014, \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraph\u00a029, and of 27\u00a0September 2017, \nPu\u0161k\u00e1r\n, C-73/16, EU:C:2017:725, paragraph\u00a038). Furthermore, Directive 95/46 does not lay down any further limitation of its scope (judgment of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a046).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, as regards the exception in Article\u00a03(2), first indent, of Directive 95/46, it has been held that the activities mentioned therein by way of exceptions are, in any event, activities of the State or of State authorities and are unrelated to fields in which individuals are active. Those activities are intended to define the scope of the exception provided for in that provision, with the result that that exception applies only to the activities which are expressly listed there or which can be classified in the same category (judgments of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraphs\u00a043 and 44; of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a041; and of 27\u00a0September 2017, \nPu\u0161k\u00e1r\n, C-73/16, EU:C:2017:725, paragraphs\u00a036 and 37).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the collection of personal data by members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community in the course of door-to-door preaching is a religious procedure carried out by individuals. It follows that such activity is not an activity of the State authorities and cannot therefore be treated in the same way as the activities referred to in Article\u00a03(2), first indent, of Directive 95/46.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as regards the exception in Article\u00a03(2), second indent, of Directive 95/46, that provision does not exclude from its scope data processing carried out in relation simply to an activity which is simply a personal or household activity, but only data processing carried out in relation to an activity that is \u2018purely\u2019 personal or household in nature (see, to that effect, judgment of 11\u00a0December 2014, \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraphs\u00a030).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The words \u2018personal or household\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, refer to the activity of the person processing the personal data and not to the person whose data are processed (see, to that effect, judgment of 11\u00a0December 2014, \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraphs\u00a031 and 33).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court held, Article\u00a03(2), second indent, of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as covering only activities that are carried out in the context of the private or family life of individuals. In that connection, an activity cannot be regarded as being purely personal or domestic where its purpose is to make the data collected accessible to an unrestricted number of people or where that activity extends,even partially, to a public space and is accordingly directed outwards from the private setting of the person processing the data in that manner (see, to that effect, judgments of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a047; of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a044; and of 11\u00a0December 2014, \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraphs\u00a031 and 33).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as it appears that the personal data processing at issue in the main proceedings is carried out in the course of door-to-door preaching by members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community, it must be determined whether such an activity is a purely personal or household activity within the meaning of Article\u00a03(2), second indent, of Directive 95/46.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it is clear from the order for reference that door-to-door preaching, in the course of which personal data are collected by members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community, is, by its very nature, intended to spread the faith of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community among people who, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a040 of his Opinion, do not belong to the faith of the members who engage in preaching. Therefore, that activity is directed outwards from the private setting of the members who engage in preaching.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it is also clear from the order for reference that some of the data collected by the members of that community who engage in preaching are sent by them to the congregations of that community which compile lists from that data of persons who no longer wish to receive visits from those members. Thus, in the course of their preaching, those members make at least some of the data collected accessible to a potentially unlimited number of persons.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to whether the fact that the processing of personal data is carried out in the course of an activity relating to a religious practice may confer a purely personal or household nature on that door-to-door preaching, it must be recalled that the right to freedom of conscience and religion, enshrined in Article\u00a010(1) of the Charter, implies, in particular, the freedom for everyone to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Charter adopts a broad understanding of the concept of \u2018religion\u2019 in that provision covering both the \nforum internum\n, that is the fact of having a belief, and the \nforum externum\n, that is the manifestation of religious faith in public (judgment of 29\u00a0May 2018, \nLiga van Moskee\u00ebn en Islamitische Organisaties Provincie Antwerpen VZW and Others\n, C-426/16, EU:C:2018:335, paragraph\u00a044 and the case-law cited).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the freedom to manifest one\u2019s religion individually or collectively in public or in private, since it may take various forms such as the teaching, practice and performance of rites, includes also the right to attempt to convince other persons, for example by means of preaching (ECtHR, 25\u00a0May 1993, \nKokkinakis\nv. Greece\n, EC:ECHR:1993:0525JUD001430788, \u00a7\u00a031, and ECtHR, 8\u00a0November 2007, \nPerry v. Latvia\n, CE:ECHR:2007:1108JUD003027303, \u00a7\u00a052).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, although the door-to-door preaching activities of the member of a religious community is thereby protected by Article\u00a010(1) of the Charter as an expression of the faith of those preachers, that fact does not confer an exclusively personal or household character on that activity, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(2), second indent, of Directive 95/46.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking account of the considerations set out in paragraphs\u00a044 and 45 of the present judgment, the preaching extends beyond the private sphere of a member of a religious community who is a preacher.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the answer to Question 1 is that Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, read in the light of Article\u00a010(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that the collection of personal data by members of a religious community in the course of door-to-door preaching and the subsequent processing of those data does not constitute either the processing of personal data for the purpose of activities referred to in Article\u00a03(2), first indent, of that directive or the processing of personal data carried out by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(2), second indent, thereof.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks essentially whether Article\u00a02(c) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of a \u2018filing system\u2019 referred to in that provision covers a set of personal data collected in the course of door-to-door preaching, consisting of names and addresses as well as other information concerning persons contacted, if those data may, in practice, be easily retrieved for later use, or whether, in order to be covered by that definition, that set of data must include data sheets, specific lists or other search methods.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is clear from Article\u00a03(1) and recitals\u00a015 and 27 of Directive 95/46, that directive covers both automatic processing of data and the manual processing of such data, so that the scope of the protection it confers on data subjects does not depend on the techniques used and avoids the risk of that protection being circumvented. However, it is also clear that that directive applies to the manual processing of personal data only where the data processed form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, since the processing of the personal data at issue in the main proceedings is carried out otherwise than by automatic means, the question arises as to whether the data processed form part of or are intended to form part of a filing system within the meaning of Article\u00a02(c) and Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 95/46.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it is stipulated in Article\u00a02(c) of Directive 95/46 that the concept of a \u2018filing system\u2019 is \u2018any structured set of personal data which are accessible according to specific criteria, whether centralised, decentralised or dispersed on a functional or geographical basis\u2019.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with the objective set out in paragraph\u00a053 of the present judgment, that provision broadly defines the concept of \u2018filing system\u2019, in particular by referring to \u2018any\u2019 structured set of personal data.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is clear from recitals\u00a015 and 27 of Directive 95/46, the content of a filing system must be structured in order to allow easy access to personal data. Furthermore, although Article\u00a02(c) of that directive does not set out the criteria according to which that filing system must be structured, it is clear from those recitals that those criteria must be \u2018relat[ed] to individuals\u2019. Therefore, it appears that the requirement that the set of personal data must be \u2018structured according to specific criteria\u2019 is simply intended to enable personal data to be easily retrieved.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from that requirement, Article\u00a02(c) of Directive 95/46 does not lay down the practical means by which a filing system is be structured or the form in which it is to be presented. In particular, it does not follow from that provision, or from any other provision of that directive, that the personal data at issue must be contained in data sheets or specific lists or in another search method, in order to establish the existence of a filing system within the meaning of that directive.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is clear from the findings of the referring court that the data collected in the course of the door-to-door preaching at issue in the main proceedings are collected as a memory aid, on the basis of an allocation by geographical sector, in order to facilitate the organisation of subsequent visits to persons who have already been contacted. They include not only information relating to the content of conversations concerning the beliefs of the person contacted, but also his name and address. Furthermore, those data, or at least a part of them, are used to draw up lists kept by the congregations of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community of persons who no longer wish to receive visits by members who engage in the preaching of that community.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it appears that the personal data collected in the course of the door-to-door preaching at issue in the main proceedings are structured according to criteria chosen in accordance with the objective pursued by that collection, which is to prepare for subsequent visits and to keep lists of persons who no longer wish to be contacted. Thus, as it is apparent from the order for reference, those criteria, among which are the name and address of persons contacted, their beliefs or their wish not to receive further visits, are chosen so that they enable data relating to specific persons to be easily retrieved.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, the specific criterion and the specific form in which the set of personal data collected by each of the members who engage in preaching is actually structured is irrelevant, so long as that set of data makes it possible for the data relating to a specific person who has been contacted to be easily retrieved, which is however for the referring court to ascertain in the light of all the circumstances of the case in the main proceedings.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the answer to Question 2 is that Article\u00a02(c) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of a \u2018filing system\u2019, referred to by that provision, covers a set of personal data collected in the course of door-to-door preaching, consisting of the names and addresses and other information concerning the persons contacted, if those data are structured according to specific criteria which, in practice, enable them to be easily retrieved for subsequent use. In order for such a set of data to fall within that concept, it is not necessary that they include data sheets, specific lists or other search methods.\n\u00a0\nThe third and fourth questions\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Questions 3 and 4, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks essentially whether Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46, read in the light of Article\u00a010(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that a religious community may be regarded as a controller, jointly with its members who engage in preaching, with regard to the processing of personal data carried out by the latter in the context of door-to-door preaching organised, coordinated and encouraged by that community, and whether it is necessary for that purpose for the community to have access to those data, or whether it must be established that the religious community has given its members written guidelines or instructions in relation to that processing.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the Data Protection Board, in the decision at issue in the main proceedings, found that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community is a controller, jointly with its members who engage in preaching, of the processing of personal data carried out by the latter in the context of door-to-door preaching. In so far as only the responsibility of that community is challenged, the responsibility of the members who engage in preaching does not appear to be called into question.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As expressly provided in Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46, the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 refers to the natural or legal person who \u2018alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data\u2019. Therefore, that concept does not necessarily refer to a single natural or legal person and may concern several actors taking part in that processing, with each of them then being subject to the applicable data protection provisions (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraph\u00a029).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The objective of that provision being to ensure, through a broad definition of the concept of \u2018controller\u2019, effective and complete protection of the persons concerned, the existence of joint responsibility does not necessarily imply equal responsibility of the various operators engaged in the processing of personal data. On the contrary, those operators may be involved at different stages of that processing of personal data and to different degrees, so that the level of responsibility of each of them must be assessed with regard to all the relevant circumstances of the particular case (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraphs\u00a028, 43 and 44).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, neither the wording of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 nor any other provision of that directive supports a finding that the determination of the purpose and means of processing must be carried out by the use of written guidelines or instructions from the controller.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, a natural or legal person who exerts influence over the processing of personal data, for his own purposes, and who participates, as a result, in the determination of the purposes and means of that processing, may be regarded as a controller within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the joint responsibility of several actors for the same processing, under that provision, does not require each of them to have access to the personal data concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraph\u00a038).\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, as is clear from the order for reference, it is true that members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community who engage in preaching determine in which specific circumstances they collect personal data relating to persons visited, which specific data are collected and how those data are subsequently processed. However, as set out in paragraphs\u00a043 and 44 of the present judgment, the collection of personal data is carried out in the course of door-to-door preaching, by which members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community who engage in preaching spread the faith of their community. That preaching activity is, as is apparent from the order for reference, organised, coordinated and encouraged by that community. In that context, the data are collected as a memory aid for later use and for a possible subsequent visit. Finally, the congregations of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community keep lists of persons who no longer wish to receive a visit, from those data which are transmitted to them by members who engage in preaching.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it appears that the collection of personal data relating to persons contacted and their subsequent processing help to achieve the objective of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community, which is to spread its faith and are, therefore, carried out by members who engage in preaching for the purposes of that community. Furthermore, not only does the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community have knowledge on a general level of the fact that such processing is carried out in order to spread its faith, but that community organises and coordinates the preaching activities of its members, in particular, by allocating areas of activity between the various members who engage in preaching.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such circumstances lead to the conclusion that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community encourages its members who engage in preaching to carry out data processing in the context of their preaching activity.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the file submitted to the Court, it appears that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Community, by organising, coordinating and encouraging the preaching activities of its members intended to spread its faith, participates, jointly with its members who engage in preaching, in determining the purposes and means of processing of personal data of the persons contacted, which is, however, for the referring court to verify with regard to all of the circumstances of the case.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That finding cannot be called into question by the principle of organisational autonomy of religious communities which derives from Article\u00a017 TFEU.\u00a0The obligation for every person to comply with the rules of EU law on the protection of personal data cannot be regarded as an interference in the organisational autonomy of those communities (see, to that effect, judgment of 17\u00a0April 2018, \nEgenberger\n, C-414/16, EU:C:2018:257, paragraph\u00a058).\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the answer to Questions 3 and 4 is that Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46, read in the light of Article\u00a010(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that it supports the finding that a religious community is a controller, jointly with its members who engage in preaching, of the processing of personal data carried out by the latter in the context of door-to-door preaching organised, coordinated and encouraged by that community, without it being necessary that the community has access to those data, or to establish that that community has given its members written guidelines or instructions in relation to the data processing.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, read in the light of Article\u00a010(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as meaning that the collection of personal data by members of a religious community in the course of door-to-door preaching and the subsequent processing of those data does not constitute either the processing of personal data for the purpose of activities referred to in Article\u00a03(2), first indent, of that directive or the processing of personal data carried out by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(2), second indent, thereof.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(c) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of a \u2018filing system\u2019, referred to by that provision, covers a set of personal data collected in the course of door-to-door preaching, consisting of the names and addresses and other information concerning the persons contacted, if those data are structured according to specific criteria which, in practice, enable them to be easily retrieved for subsequent use. In order for such a set of data to fall within that concept, it is not necessary that they include data sheets, specific lists or other search methods.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46, read in the light of Article\u00a010(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must be interpreted as meaning that it supports the finding that a religious community is a controller, jointly with its members who engage in preaching, for the processing of personal data carried out by the latter in the context of door-to-door preaching organised, coordinated and encouraged by that community, without it being necessary that the community has access to those data, or to establish that that community has given its members written guidelines or instructions in relation to the data processing."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 5 Jun 2018, C-210/16 (\nWirtschaftsakademie

following\nJudgment\n1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This request for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L\u00a0281, p.\u00a031).\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The request has been made in proceedings between the Unabh\u00e4ngiges Landeszentrum f\u00fcr Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein (Independent

(\u2018Wirtschaftsakademie\u2019), concerning the lawfulness of ULD\u2019s order to Wirtschaftsakademie to deactivate its fan page on the Facebook social network site

state:\n\u2018(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the object of the national laws on the processing of personal data is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, which is recognised both in Article\u00a08 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in the general principles of [EU] law; whereas, for that reason, the approximation of those laws must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the [European Union];\n...\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas, in order to ensure that individuals are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this Directive, any processing of personal data in the [European Union] must be carried out in accordance with the law of one of the Member States; whereas, in this connection, processing carried out under the responsibility of a controller who is established in a Member State should be governed by the law of that State;\n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas establishment on the territory of a Member State implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements; whereas the legal form of such an establishment, whether simply branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in this respect; whereas, when a single controller is established on the territory of several Member States, particularly by means of subsidiaries, he must ensure, in order to avoid any circumvention of national rules, that each of the establishments fulfils the obligations imposed by the national law applicable to its activities;\n\u2026\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the principles of protection must apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable person; whereas, to determine whether a person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said person; whereas the principles of protection shall not apply to data rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable;

accordance with this Directive, Member States shall protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal

dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction;\n...\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201ccontroller\u201d shall mean the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of processing are determined by national or [EU] laws or regulations, the controller or the specific criteria for his nomination may be designated by national or [EU] law;\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cprocessor\u201d shall mean a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cthird party\u201d shall mean any natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body other than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or the processor, are authorised to process the data;\n...\u2019\n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04 of that directive, \u2018National law applicable\u2019, provides in paragraph\u00a01:\n\u2018Each Member State shall apply the national provisions it adopts pursuant to this Directive to the processing of personal data where:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the processing is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of the Member State; when the same controller is established on the territory of several Member States, he must take the necessary measures to ensure that each of these establishments complies with the obligations laid down by the national law applicable;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the controller is not established on the Member State\u2019s territory, but in a place where its national law applies by virtue of international public law;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the controller is not established on [EU] territory and, for purposes of processing personal data makes use of equipment, automated or otherwise, situated on the territory of the said Member State, unless such equipment is used only for purposes of transit through the territory of the [European Union].\u2019\n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a017 of the directive, \u2018Security of processing\u2019, provides in paragraphs\u00a01 and 2: \n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall provide that the controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.\nHaving regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation, such measures shall ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States shall provide that the controller must, where processing is carried out on his behalf, choose a processor providing sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical security measures and organisational measures governing the processing to be carried out, and must ensure compliance with those measures.\u2019\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a024 of the directive, \u2018Sanctions\u2019, provides:\n\u2018The Member States shall adopt suitable measures to ensure the full implementation of the provisions of this Directive and shall in particular lay down the sanctions to be imposed in case of infringement of the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive.\u2019\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a028 of the directive, \u2018Supervisory authority\u2019, reads as follows:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall provide that one or more public authorities are responsible for monitoring the application within its territory of the

them.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall provide that the supervisory authorities are consulted when drawing up administrative measures or regulations relating to the

opinions before processing operations are carried out, in accordance with Article\u00a020, and ensuring appropriate publication of such opinions, of ordering the blocking, erasure or destruction of data, of imposing a temporary or definitive ban on processing, of warning or admonishing the controller, or that of referring the matter to national parliaments or other political institutions,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the power to engage in legal proceedings where the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive have been violated or to

The commission must be given in writing, with the following in particular being determined in detail: \u2026 \nThe commissioning entity must satisfy itself, before the start of the data processing and regularly thereafter, that the technical and organisational measures taken by the entity commissioned are complied with. The results must be documented.\n\u2026\u2019\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph\u00a038(5) of the BDSG provides:\n\u2018To ensure compliance with this law and with other provisions on data protection, the supervisory authority may order measures to eliminate breaches that have been ascertained in the collection, processing or use of personal data or technical or organisational defects. In the case of serious breaches or defects, in particular those which are associated with a particular threat to the right to protection of personality, it can prohibit the collection, processing or use or the application of specific procedures if the breaches or defects are not eliminated within a reasonable time, contrary to an order in accordance with the first sentence and despite the imposition of a penalty payment. It can require the data protection officer to be removed if he does not possess the expert knowledge and reliability needed to perform his duties.\u2019\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph\u00a012 of the Telemediengesetz (Law on electronic media) of 26\u00a0February 2007 (BGBl. 2007 I, p.\u00a0179, \u2018the TMG\u2019) reads as follows:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The service provider may collect and use personal data for the provision of electronic media only where this law or another provision of law expressly relating to electronic media permits it or the user has consented.\n... \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except as provided otherwise, the provisions in force for the protection of personal data are to be applied even if the data is not processed automatically.\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wirtschaftsakademie offers educational services by means of a fan page hosted on Facebook.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fan pages are user accounts that can be set up on Facebook by individuals or businesses. To do so, the author of the fan page, after registering with Facebook, can use the platform designed by Facebook to introduce himself to the users of that social network and to persons visiting the fan page, and to post any kind of communication in the media and opinion market. Administrators of fan pages can obtain anonymous statistical information on visitors to the fan pages via a function called \u2018Facebook Insights\u2019 which Facebook makes available to them free of charge under non-negotiable conditions of use. That information is collected by means of evidence files (\u2018cookies\u2019), each containing a unique user code, which are active for two years and are stored by Facebook on the hard disk of the computer or on other media of visitors to fan pages. The user code, which can be matched with the connection data of users registered on Facebook, is collected and processed when the fan pages are opened. According to the order for reference, neither Wirtschaftsakademie nor Facebook Ireland Ltd notified the storage and functioning of the cookie or the subsequent processing of the data, at least during the material period for the main proceedings.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 3\u00a0November 2011 (\u2018the contested decision\u2019), the ULD, as supervisory authority within the meaning of Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, with the task of supervising the application in the \nLand\n of Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) of the provisions adopted by the Federal Republic of Germany pursuant to that directive, ordered Wirtschaftsakademie, in accordance with the first sentence of Paragraph\u00a038(5) of the BDSG, to deactivate the fan page it had set up on Facebook at the address www.facebook.com/wirtschaftsakademie, on pain of a penalty payment if it failed to comply within the prescribed period, on the ground that neither Wirtschaftsakademie nor Facebook informed visitors to the fan page that Facebook, by means of cookies, collected personal data concerning them and then processed the data. Wirtschaftsakademie brought a complaint against that decision, arguing essentially that it was not responsible under data protection law for the processing of the data by Facebook or the cookies which Facebook installed.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 16\u00a0December 2011, the ULD dismissed the complaint, finding that Wirtschaftsakademie as a service provider was liable under Paragraph\u00a03(3)(4) and Paragraph\u00a012(1) of the TMG in conjunction with Paragraph\u00a03(7) of the BDSG. The ULD stated that, by setting up its fan page, Wirtschaftsakademie had made an active and deliberate contribution to the collection by Facebook of personal data relating to visitors to the fan page, from which it profited by means of the statistics provided to it by Facebook.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wirtschaftsakademie brought an action against that decision in the Verwaltungsgericht (Administrative Court, Germany), submitting that the processing of personal data by Facebook could not be attributed to it and that it had not commissioned Facebook within the meaning of Paragraph\u00a011 of the BDSG to process data that it controlled or was able to influence. Wirtschaftsakademie concluded that the ULD should have acted directly against Facebook instead of adopting the contested decision against it.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By judgment of 9\u00a0October 2013, the Verwaltungsgericht (Administrative Court) annulled the contested decision, essentially on the ground that, since the administrator of a fan page on Facebook is not a responsible entity within the meaning of Paragraph\u00a03(7) of the BDSG, Wirtschaftsakademie could not be the addressee of a measure taken under Paragraph\u00a038(5) of the BDSG.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Oberverwaltungsgericht (Higher Administrative Court, Germany) dismissed the ULD\u2019s appeal against that judgment as unfounded. It found essentially that the prohibition of the processing of data in the contested decision was unlawful, in that the second sentence of Paragraph\u00a038(5) of the BDSG lays down a step-by-step procedure whose first step allows only the adoption of measures for the elimination of infringements that have been ascertained in the processing of data. An immediate prohibition of the processing of data comes into consideration only if a data processing procedure is unlawful in its entirety and the only possible remedy is to terminate it. According to the Oberverwaltungsgericht (Higher Administrative Court), that was not the case here, since it would have been possible for Facebook to put an end to the infringements alleged by the ULD.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Oberverwaltungsgericht (Higher Administrative Court) further stated that the contested decision was also unlawful on the ground that an order under Paragraph\u00a038(5) of the BDSG may only be made against the responsible entity within the meaning of Paragraph\u00a03(7) of the BDSG, and that Wirtschaftsakademie was not such an entity in relation to the data collected by Facebook. Facebook alone decided on the purpose and means of collecting and processing personal data used for the Facebook Insights function, Wirtschaftsakademie receiving only anonymised statistical information.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ULD appealed on a point of law to the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court, Germany), relying inter alia on an infringement of Paragraph\u00a038(5) of the BDSG and on a number of procedural errors vitiating the appellate court\u2019s decision. It considers that the infringement committed by Wirtschaftsakademie consisted in commissioning an inappropriate supplier\u00a0\u2014 inappropriate because it did not comply with the applicable data protection law\u00a0\u2014 namely Facebook Ireland, to create, host and maintain a website. The order to Wirtschaftsakademie to deactivate its fan page, imposed by the contested decision, was thus intended to remedy that breach, since it prohibited it from continuing to make use of Facebook infrastructure as the technical basis of its website.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like the Oberverwaltungsgericht (Higher Administrative Court), the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court) takes the view that Wirtschaftsakademie cannot itself be regarded as responsible for the data processing within the meaning Paragraph\u00a03(7) of the BDSG or Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46. It considers nevertheless that the concept of controller should in principle be interpreted broadly, in the interests of effective protection of the right of privacy, as the Court has held in its recent case-law on the point. It further entertains doubts as to the powers of the ULD with respect to Facebook Germany in the present case, given that it is Facebook Ireland that is responsible, at EU level, for the collection and processing of personal data within the Facebook group. Finally, it is uncertain as to the effect, for the purpose of the exercise of the ULD\u2019s powers of intervention, of the assessments made by the supervisory authority to which Facebook Ireland is subject concerning the lawfulness of the processing of personal data at issue.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a02(d) of Directive [95/46] to be interpreted as definitively and exhaustively defining the liability and responsibility for data protection infringements, or does scope remain, under the \u201csuitable measures\u201d pursuant to Article\u00a024 of Directive [95/46] and the \u201ceffective powers of intervention\u201d pursuant to the second indent of Article\u00a028(3) of Directive [95/46], in multi-tiered information provider relationships, for responsibility of an entity that does not control the data processing within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive [95/46] when it chooses the operator of its information offering?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does it follow \na contrario\n from the obligation of Member States under Article\u00a017(2) of Directive [95/46] to provide, where data processing is carried out on the controller\u2019s behalf, that the controller must \u201cchoose a processor providing sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical security measures and organisational measures governing the processing to be carried out\u201d, that, where there are other user relationships not linked to data processing on the controller\u2019s behalf within the meaning of Article\u00a02(e) of Directive [95/46], there is no obligation to make a careful selection and no such obligation can be based on national law?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In cases in which a parent company based outside the European Union has legally independent establishments (subsidiaries) in various Member States, is the supervisory authority of a Member State (in this case, Germany) entitled under Article\u00a04 and Article\u00a028(6) of Directive [95/46] to exercise the powers conferred under Article\u00a028(3) of Directive [95/46] against the establishment located in its territory even when this establishment is responsible solely for promoting the sale of advertising and other marketing measures aimed at the inhabitants of that Member State, whereas the independent establishment (subsidiary) located in another Member State (in this case, Ireland) is exclusively responsible within the group\u2019s internal division of tasks for collecting and processing personal data throughout the entire territory of the European Union and hence in the other Member State as well (in this case, Germany), if the decision on the data processing is in fact taken by the parent company?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are Article\u00a04(1)(a) and Article\u00a028(3) of Directive [95/46] to be interpreted as meaning that, in cases in which the controller has an establishment in the territory of one Member State (in this case, Ireland) and there is another, legally independent establishment in the territory of another Member State (in this case, Germany), whose responsibilities include the sale of advertising space and whose activity is aimed at the inhabitants of that State, the competent supervisory authority in this other Member State (in this case, Germany) may direct measures and orders implementing data protection legislation also against the other establishment (in this case, in Germany) not responsible for data processing under the group\u2019s internal division of tasks and responsibilities, or are measures and orders only possible by the supervisory body of the Member State (in this case, Ireland) in whose territory the entity with internal responsibility within the group has its registered office?\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are Article\u00a04(1)(a) and Article\u00a028(3) and (6) of Directive [95/46] to be interpreted as meaning that, in cases in which the supervisory authority in one Member State (in this case, Germany) takes action against a person or entity in its territory pursuant to Article\u00a028(3) of Directive [95/46] on the grounds of failure carefully to select a third party involved in the data processing process (in this case, Facebook), because that third party infringes data protection legislation, the active supervisory authority (in this case, Germany) is bound by the appraisal made under data protection legislation by the supervisory authority of the Member State in which the third party responsible for the data processing has its establishment (in this case, Ireland) meaning that it may not arrive at a different legal appraisal, or may the active supervisory authority (in this case, Germany) conduct its own examination of the lawfulness of the data processing by the third party established in another Member State (in this case, Ireland) as a preliminary question prior to its own action?\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the possibility of conducting an independent examination is available to the active supervisory authority (in this case, Germany), is the second sentence of Article\u00a028(6) of Directive [95/46] to be interpreted as meaning that this supervisory authority may exercise the effective powers of intervention conferred on it under Article\u00a028(3) of Directive [95/46] against a person or entity established in its territory on the grounds of their joint responsibility for data protection infringements by a third party established in another Member State only if and not until it has first requested the supervisory authority in this other Member State (in this case, Ireland) to exercise its powers?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nQuestions 1 and 2\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first and second questions, which should be considered together, the referring court essentially wishes to know whether Article\u00a02(d), Article\u00a017(2), Article\u00a024 and the second indent of Article\u00a028(3) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as allowing an entity to be held liable in its capacity as administrator of a fan page on a social network where the rules on the protection of personal data are infringed, because it has chosen to make use of that social network to distribute the information it offers.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To answer those questions, it must be recalled that, as is apparent from Article\u00a01(1) and recital 10 of Directive 95/46, the directive aims to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data (judgment of 11\u00a0December 2014, \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraph\u00a027 and the case-law cited).\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with that aim, Article\u00a02(d) of the directive defines the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 broadly as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has previously held, the objective of that provision is to ensure, through a broad definition of the concept of \u2018controller\u2019, effective and complete protection of the persons concerned (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a034).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, since, as Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 expressly provides, the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 relates to the entity which \u2018alone or jointly with others\u2019 determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, that concept does not necessarily refer to a single entity and may concern several actors taking part in that processing, with each of them then being subject to the applicable data protection provisions.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, Facebook Inc. and, for the European Union, Facebook Ireland must be regarded as primarily determining the purposes and means of processing the personal data of users of Facebook and persons visiting the fan pages hosted on Facebook, and therefore fall within the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46, which is not challenged in the present case.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, and in order to answer the questions referred, it must be examined whether and to what extent the administrator of a fan page hosted on Facebook, such as Wirtschaftsakademie, contributes in the context of that fan page to determining, jointly with Facebook Ireland and Facebook Inc., the purposes and means of processing the personal data of the visitors to the fan page and may therefore also be regarded as a \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It appears that any person wishing to create a fan page on Facebook concludes a specific contract with Facebook Ireland for the opening of such a page, and thereby subscribes to the conditions of use of the page, including the policy on cookies, which is for the national court to ascertain.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the documents before the Court, the data processing at issue in the main proceedings is essentially carried out by Facebook placing cookies on the computer or other device of persons visiting the fan page, whose purpose is to store information on the browsers, those cookies remaining active for two years if not deleted. It also appears that in practice Facebook receives, registers and processes the information stored in the cookies in particular when a person visits \u2018the Facebook services, services provided by other members of the Facebook family of companies, and services provided by other companies that use the Facebook services\u2019. Moreover, other entities such as Facebook partners or even third parties \u2018may use cookies on the Facebook services to provide services [directly to that social network] and the businesses that advertise on Facebook\u2019.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That processing of personal data is intended in particular to enable Facebook to improve its system of advertising transmitted via its network, and to enable the fan page administrator to obtain statistics produced by Facebook from the visits to the page, for the purposes of managing the promotion of its activity, making it aware, for example, of the profile of the visitors who like its fan page or use its applications, so that it can offer them more relevant content and develop functionalities likely to be of more interest to them.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the mere fact of making use of a social network such as Facebook does not make a Facebook user a controller jointly responsible for the processing of personal data by that network, it must be stated, on the other hand, that the administrator of a fan page hosted on Facebook, by creating such a page, gives Facebook the opportunity to place cookies on the computer or other device of a person visiting its fan page, whether or not that person has a Facebook account.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this context, according to the submissions made to the Court, the creation of a fan page on Facebook involves the definition of parameters by the administrator, depending inter alia on the target audience and the objectives of managing and promoting its activities, which has an influence on the processing of personal data for the purpose of producing statistics based on visits to the fan page. The administrator may, with the help of filters made available by Facebook, define the criteria in accordance with which the statistics are to be drawn up and even designate the categories of persons whose personal data is to be made use of by Facebook. Consequently, the administrator of a fan page hosted on Facebook contributes to the processing of the personal data of visitors to its page.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the administrator of the fan page can ask for\u00a0\u2014 and thereby request the processing of\u00a0\u2014 demographic data relating to its target audience, including trends in terms of age, sex, relationship and occupation, information on the lifestyles and centres of interest of the target audience and information on the purchases and online purchasing habits of visitors to its page, the categories of goods and services that appeal the most, and geographical data which tell the fan page administrator where to make special offers and where to organise events, and more generally enable it to target best the information it offers.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the audience statistics compiled by Facebook are indeed transmitted to the fan page administrator only in anonymised form, it remains the case that the production of those statistics is based on the prior collection, by means of cookies installed by Facebook on the computers or other devices of visitors to that page, and the processing of the personal data of those visitors for such statistical purposes. In any event, Directive 95/46 does not, where several operators are jointly responsible for the same processing, require each of them to have access to the personal data concerned.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the administrator of a fan page hosted on Facebook, such as Wirtschaftsakademie, must be regarded as taking part, by its definition of parameters depending in particular on its target audience and the objectives of managing and promoting its activities, in the determination of the purposes and means of processing the personal data of the visitors to its fan page. The administrator must therefore be categorised, in the present case, as a controller responsible for that processing within the European Union, jointly with Facebook Ireland, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that an administrator of a fan page uses the platform provided by Facebook in order to benefit from the associated services cannot exempt it from compliance with its obligations concerning the protection of personal data.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be emphasised, moreover, that fan pages hosted on Facebook can also be visited by persons who are not Facebook users and so do not have a user account on that social network. In that case, the fan page administrator\u2019s responsibility for the processing of the personal data of those persons appears to be even greater, as the mere consultation of the home page by visitors automatically starts the processing of their personal data.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the recognition of joint responsibility of the operator of the social network and the administrator of a fan page hosted on that network in relation to the processing of the personal data of visitors to that page contributes to ensuring more complete protection of the rights of persons visiting a fan page, in accordance with the requirements of Directive 95/46.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it should be pointed out, as the Advocate General observes in points\u00a075 and 76 of his Opinion, that the existence of joint responsibility does not necessarily imply equal responsibility of the various operators involved in the processing of personal data. On the contrary, those operators may be involved at different stages of that processing of personal data and to different degrees, so that the level of responsibility of each of them must be assessed with regard to all the relevant circumstances of the particular case.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the above considerations, the answer to Questions 1 and 2 is that Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of that provision encompasses the administrator of a fan page hosted on a social network.\n\u00a0\nQuestions 3 and 4\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third and fourth questions, which should be considered together, the referring court essentially wishes to know whether Articles\u00a04 and 28 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, where an undertaking established outside the European Union has several establishments in different Member States, the supervisory authority of a Member State is entitled to exercise the powers conferred on it by Article\u00a028(3) of that directive with respect to an establishment situated in the territory of that Member State even if, as a result of the division of tasks within the group, first, that establishment is responsible solely for the sale of advertising space and other marketing activities in the territory of that Member State and, second, exclusive responsibility for collecting and processing personal data belongs, for the entire territory of the European Union, to an establishment situated in another Member State, or whether it is for the supervisory authority of that other Member State to exercise those powers with respect to the second establishment.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ULD and the Italian Government express doubts as to the admissibility of those questions, on the ground that they are not relevant to the outcome of the main proceedings. They submit that the contested decision is addressed to Wirtschaftsakademie and does not therefore concern Facebook Inc. or any of its subsidiaries established in EU territory.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On this point, it must be recalled that, in the context of the cooperation between the Court and the national courts provided for in Article\u00a0267 TFEU, it is solely for the national court, before which the dispute has been brought and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, where the questions submitted concern the interpretation of EU law, the Court is, in principle, bound to give a ruling (judgment of 6\u00a0September 2016, \nPetruhhin\n, C-182/15, EU:C:2016:630, paragraph\u00a019 and the case-law cited).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it should be noted that the referring court states that an answer by the Court to its third and fourth questions is necessary for it to rule on the main proceedings. It explains that, should it be found in the light of that answer that the ULD could remedy the alleged infringements of the right to protection of personal data by taking a measure against Facebook Germany, such a finding could indicate that the contested decision was vitiated by an error of assessment, in that it was wrongly taken against Wirtschaftsakademie. \n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, Questions 3 and 4 are admissible.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To answer those questions, it must be recalled as a preliminary point that, in accordance with Article\u00a028(1) and (3) of Directive 95/46, each supervisory authority is to exercise all the powers conferred on it by national law in the territory of its own Member State, in order to ensure compliance with the data protection rules in that territory (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0October 2015, \nWeltimmo\n, C-230/14, EU:C:2015:639, paragraph\u00a051).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question of which national law applies to the processing of personal data is governed by Article\u00a04 of Directive 95/46. As stated in Article\u00a04(1)(a), each Member State is to apply the national provisions it adopts pursuant to the directive to the processing of personal data, where the processing is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of the Member State. That provision states that, where the same controller is established on the territory of several Member States, he must take the necessary measures to ensure that each of those establishments complies with the obligations laid down by the national law applicable.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It thus follows from a reading of that provision in conjunction with Article\u00a028(1) and (3) of Directive 95/46 that, where the national law of the Member State of the supervisory authority is applicable under Article\u00a04(1)(a) of the directive because the processing in question is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller in the territory of that Member State, that supervisory authority can exercise all the powers conferred on it by that law in respect of that establishment, regardless of whether the controller also has establishments in other Member States.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order, therefore, to determine whether, in circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, a supervisory authority is entitled to exercise the powers conferred on it by national law against an establishment situated in the territory of its own Member State, it must be ascertained whether the two conditions laid down by Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 are satisfied, in other words, whether there is an \u2018establishment of the controller\u2019 within the meaning of that provision and whether the processing is carried out \u2018in the context of the activities\u2019 of the establishment, also within the meaning of that provision.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, first, the condition that the controller responsible for the processing of personal data must have an establishment in the territory of the Member State of the supervisory authority, it must be recalled that, according to recital 19 of Directive 95/46, establishment in the territory of a Member State implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements, and the legal form of such an establishment, whether simply a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor (judgment of 1\u00a0October 2015, \nWeltimmo\n, C-230/14, EU:C:2015:639, paragraph\u00a028 and the case-law cited).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is common ground that Facebook Inc., as controller jointly responsible with Facebook Ireland for processing personal data, has a permanent establishment in Germany, namely Facebook Germany, situated in Hamburg, and that Facebook Germany effectively and genuinely exercises activities in that Member State. It is therefore an establishment within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, second, the condition that the processing of personal data must be carried out \u2018in the context of the activities\u2019 of the establishment in question, it must be recalled, to begin with, that in view of the objective pursued by Directive 95/46 of ensuring effective and complete protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data, the expression \u2018in the context of the activities of an establishment\u2019 cannot be interpreted restrictively (judgment of 1\u00a0October 2015, \nWeltimmo\n, C-230/14, EU:C:2015:639, paragraph\u00a025 and the case-law cited).\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, it must be pointed out that Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 does not require that such processing be carried out \u2018by\u2019 the establishment concerned itself, but only that it be carried out \u2018in the context of the activities of\u2019 the establishment (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a052).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the order for reference and the written observations submitted by Facebook Ireland show that Facebook Germany is responsible for promoting and selling advertising space and carries on activities addressed to persons residing in Germany.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted in paragraphs\u00a033 and 34 above, the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings, carried out by Facebook Inc. jointly with Facebook Ireland, consisting in collecting personal data by means of cookies installed on the computers or other devices of visitors to fan pages hosted on Facebook, is intended, in particular, to enable Facebook to improve its system of advertising, in order better to target its communications.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observes in point\u00a094 of his Opinion, given that a social network such as Facebook generates a substantial part of its income from advertisements posted on the web pages set up and accessed by users, and given that Facebook\u2019s establishment in Germany is intended to ensure the promotion and sale in Germany of advertising space that makes Facebook\u2019s services profitable, the activities of that establishment must be regarded as inextricably linked to the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings, for which Facebook Inc. is jointly responsible with Facebook Ireland. Consequently, such treatment must be regarded as being carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 (see, to that effect, judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraphs\u00a055 and 56).\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, since German law is applicable to the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings in accordance with Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, the German supervisory authority was competent under Article\u00a028(1) of that directive to apply that law to that processing.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That supervisory authority was therefore competent, for the purpose of ensuring compliance in German territory with the rules on the protection of personal data, to exercise with respect to Facebook Germany all the powers conferred on it under the national provisions transposing Article\u00a028(3) of Directive 95/46.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be stated that the circumstance, emphasised by the referring court in its third question, that the strategic decisions on the collection and processing of personal data relating to persons resident in EU territory are taken by a parent company established in a third country, such as Facebook Inc. in the present case, is not capable of calling in question the competence of the supervisory authority operating under the law of a Member State with respect to an establishment in the territory of that State belonging to the controller responsible for the processing of that data.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Questions 3 and 4 is that Articles\u00a04 and 28 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, where an undertaking established outside the European Union has several establishments in different Member States, the supervisory authority of a Member State is entitled to exercise the powers conferred on it by Article\u00a028(3) of that directive with respect to an establishment of that undertaking situated in the territory of that Member State even if, as a result of the division of tasks within the group, first, that establishment is responsible solely for the sale of advertising space and other marketing activities in the territory of that Member State and, second, exclusive responsibility for collecting and processing personal data belongs, for the entire territory of the European Union, to an establishment situated in another Member State.\n\u00a0\nQuestions 5 and 6\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fifth and sixth questions, which should be considered together, the referring court asks essentially whether Article\u00a04(1)(a) and Article\u00a028(3) and (6) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, where the supervisory authority of a Member State intends to exercise with respect to an entity established in the territory of that Member State the powers of intervention referred to in Article\u00a028(3) of that directive, on the ground of infringements of the rules on the protection of personal data committed by a third party responsible for the processing of that data whose seat is in another Member State, that supervisory authority is competent to assess, independently of the supervisory authority of the other Member State, the lawfulness of such data processing and may exercise its powers of intervention with respect to the entity established in its territory without first calling on the supervisory authority of the other Member State to intervene.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To answer those questions, it must be recalled, as may be seen from the answer to the first and second questions referred for a preliminary ruling, that Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as allowing, in circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, an entity such as Wirtschaftsakademie to be held responsible, as the administrator of a fan page hosted on Facebook, in the event of an infringement of the rules on the protection of personal data.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, by virtue of Article\u00a04(1)(a) and Article\u00a028(1) and (3) of Directive 95/46, the supervisory authority of the Member State in whose territory that entity is established is competent to apply its national law, and thus to make use against that entity of all the powers conferred on it by its national law, in accordance with Article\u00a028(3) of that directive.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As provided for by the second subparagraph of Article\u00a028(1) of that directive, the supervisory authorities whose task it is to supervise the application, in the territory of their own Member States, of the provisions adopted by those States pursuant to the directive are to act with complete independence in exercising the functions entrusted to them. That requirement also follows from EU primary law, in particular Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article\u00a016(2) TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a040).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, while under the second subparagraph of Article\u00a028(6) of Directive 95/46 the supervisory authorities are to cooperate with one another to the extent necessary for the performance of their duties, in particular by exchanging all useful information, that directive does not lay down any criterion of priority governing the intervention of one supervisory authority as against another, nor does it lay down an obligation for a supervisory authority of one Member State to comply with a position which may have been expressed by the supervisory authority of another Member State.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A supervisory authority which is competent under its national law is not therefore obliged to adopt the conclusion reached by another supervisory authority in an analogous situation.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be recalled that, as the national supervisory authorities are responsible, in accordance with Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, for monitoring compliance with the EU rules concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, each of them is therefore vested with the power to check whether the processing of personal data in the territory of its own Member State complies with the requirements laid down by Directive 95/46 (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a047).\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46 applies by its very nature to any processing of personal data, even where there is a decision of a supervisory authority of another Member State, a supervisory authority hearing a claim lodged by a person concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms with regard to the processing of personal data relating to him must examine, with complete independence, whether the processing of that data complies with the requirements laid down by that directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a057).\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in the present case, under the system established by Directive 95/46, the ULD was entitled to assess, independently of the assessments made by the Irish supervisory authority, the lawfulness of the data processing at issue in the main proceedings.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the answer to Questions 5 and 6 is that Article\u00a04(1)(a) and Article\u00a028(3) and (6) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, where the supervisory authority of a Member State intends to exercise with respect to an entity established in the territory of that Member State the powers of intervention referred to in Article\u00a028(3) of that directive, on the ground of infringements of the rules on the protection of personal data committed by a third party responsible for the processing of that data whose seat is in another Member State, that supervisory authority is competent to assess, independently of the supervisory authority of the other Member State, the lawfulness of such data processing and may exercise its powers of intervention with respect to the entity established in its territory without first calling on the supervisory authority of the other Member State to intervene.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(d) of Directive \n95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data \nmust be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of that provision encompasses the administrator of a fan page hosted on a social network.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticles\u00a04 and 28 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, where an undertaking established outside the European Union has several establishments in different Member States, the supervisory authority of a Member State is entitled to exercise the powers conferred on it by Article\u00a028(3) of that directive with respect to an establishment of that undertaking situated in the territory of that Member State even if, as a result of the division of tasks within the group, first, that establishment is responsible solely for the sale of advertising space and other marketing activities in the territory of that Member State and, second, exclusive responsibility for collecting and processing personal data belongs, for the entire territory of the European Union, to an establishment situated in another Member State.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a04(1)(a) and Article\u00a028(3) and (6) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, where the supervisory authority of a Member State intends to exercise with respect to an entity established in the territory of that Member State the powers of intervention referred to in Article\u00a028(3) of that directive, on the ground of infringements of the rules on the protection of personal data committed by a third party responsible for the processing of that data whose seat is in another Member State, that supervisory authority is competent to assess, independently of the supervisory authority of the other Member State, the lawfulness of such data processing and may exercise its powers of intervention with respect to the entity established in its territory without first calling on the supervisory authority of the other Member State to intervene."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 15 Jun 2021, C-645/19 (\nFacebook Ireland and\u00a0Others\n)\nCharter of

Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ 2016 L\u00a0119, p.\u00a01, and corrigendum OJ 2018 L\u00a0127, p.\u00a02), read together with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European

the one hand, and the Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit (the Belgian Data Protection Authority) (\u2018the DPA\u2019), as the successor of the Commissie ter bescherming van de Persoonlijke Levenssfeer (the Belgian Privacy Commission) (\u2018the Privacy Commission\u2019), on the other, concerning injunction proceedings brought by the President of the Privacy Commission seeking to bring to an end the processing of personal data, of internet users within Belgium, by the Facebook online social network, using cookies, social plug-ins and pixels.\n\u00a0\nLegal context\n\u00a0\nEuropean Union

natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right. Article\u00a08(1) of the [Charter] and Article\u00a016(1) [TFEU] provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\n\u2026\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.\n\u2026\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the [European] Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union.\u00a0\u2026\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States.\n\u2026\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States.\n\u2026\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself takes place within the Union.

As regards solely complaints or applications lodged with the DPA itself, Article\u00a0112 of the law of 3\u00a0December 2017 states:\n\u2018Chapter VI shall not apply to complaints or applications still pending at the [DPA] at the time when this legislation enters into force. The complaints or applications mentioned in subparagraph\u00a01 shall be dealt with by the [DPA], as the legal successor of the [Privacy Commission], in accordance with the procedure applicable before the entry into force of this legislation.\u2019\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The law of 8\u00a0December 1992 was repealed by the wet betreffende de bescherming van natuurlijke personen met betrekking tot de verwerking van persoonsgegevens (law on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data) of 30\u00a0July 2018 (\nBelgisch Staatsblad\n, 5\u00a0September 2018, p.\u00a068616; \u2018the law of 30\u00a0July 2018\u2019). That law transposes into Belgian law the provisions of Regulation 2016/679 requiring or permitting Member States to adopt more detailed rules, to supplement that regulation.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 11\u00a0September 2015 the President of the Privacy Commission brought legal proceedings seeking an injunction against Facebook Ireland, Facebook Inc. and Facebook Belgium before the Nederlandstalige rechtbank van eerste aanleg Brussel (Dutch-language Court of First Instance, Brussels, Belgium). Since the Privacy Commission had no legal personality, it was necessary that the President of that body take legal action in order to ensure compliance with the legislation on the protection of personal data. However, the Privacy Commission itself sought leave to intervene in the proceedings brought by its President.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The object of those injunction proceedings was to bring to an end what the Privacy Commission describes, inter alia, as a \u2018serious and large-scale infringement, by Facebook, of the legislation relating to the protection of privacy\u2019 consisting in the collection by that online social network of information on the internet browsing behaviour both of Facebook account holders and of non-users of Facebook services by means of various technologies, such as cookies, social plug-ins (for example, the \u2018Like\u2019 or \u2018Share\u2019 buttons) or pixels. Those features permit Facebook to obtain certain data of an internet user who visits a website page containing them, such as the address of that page, the \u2018IP address\u2019 of the visitor to that page and the date and time of the visit in question. \n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By judgment of 16\u00a0February 2018, the Nederlandstalige rechtbank van eerste aanleg Brussel (Dutch-language Court of First Instance, Brussels) held that it had jurisdiction to give a ruling on those injunction proceedings, in so far as the action concerned Facebook Ireland, Facebook Inc. and Facebook Belgium, and declared that the application for leave to intervene made by the Privacy Commission was inadmissible.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the substance, that court held that Facebook was not adequately informing Belgian internet users of the collection of the information concerned and of the use of that information. Further, the consent given by the internet users to the collection and processing of that data was held to be invalid. Consequently, that court ordered Facebook Ireland, Facebook Inc. and Facebook Belgium (i) to desist, as regards all internet users established in Belgium, from placing, without their consent, cookies that remain active for two years on the devices used by them when browsing a web page in the Facebook.com domain or visiting the website of a third party, and from placing cookies and collecting data by means of social plug-ins, pixels or similar technological means on third-party websites, in a manner that was excessive in the light of the objectives thereby pursued by the Facebook social network, (ii) to desist from providing information that might reasonably mislead the data subjects as to the real extent of the mechanisms put in place by Facebook for the use of cookies, and (iii) to destroy all the personal data obtained by means of cookies and social plug-ins.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 2\u00a0March 2018 Facebook Ireland, Facebook Inc. and Facebook Belgium brought an appeal against that judgment before the hof van beroep te Brussel (Court of Appeal, Brussels, Belgium). Before that court, the DPA acts as the legal successor both of the President of the Privacy Commission, who had brought the injunction proceedings, and of the Privacy Commission itself.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court held that it has jurisdiction solely to give a ruling on the appeal brought in so far as that appeal concerns Facebook Belgium. Conversely, the referring court held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear that appeal in relation to Facebook Ireland and Facebook Inc.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before giving a ruling on the substance of the main proceedings, a question raised by the referring court is whether the DPA had the required standing and interest to bring proceedings. In the view of Facebook Belgium, the action brought seeking an injunction is inadmissible, in so far as it concerns facts prior to 25\u00a0May 2018, given that, following the entry into force of the law of 3\u00a0December 2017 and of Regulation 2016/679, Article\u00a032(3) of the law of 8\u00a0December 1992, which is the legal basis for bringing such an action, was repealed. As regards the facts subsequent to 25\u00a0May 2018, Facebook Belgium claims that the DPA has no competence and has no right to bring such an action given the existence of the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 mechanism now provided for under the provisions of Regulation 2016/679. On the basis of those provisions, it is claimed that only the Data Protection Commissioner (Ireland) is competent to bring injunction proceedings against Facebook Ireland, the latter being the sole controller of the personal data of the users of the social network concerned within the European Union.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court has held that the DPA had not demonstrated the required standing to bring the injunction proceedings in so far as those proceedings related to facts prior to 25\u00a0May 2018. As regards the facts subsequent to that date, the referring court is however uncertain as to the effect of the entry into force of Regulation 2016/679, in particular the effect of the application of the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 mechanism provided for by that regulation, on the competences of the DPA and on its power to bring such injunction proceedings.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, in the view of the referring court, the question that now arises is whether, with respect to the facts subsequent to 25\u00a0May 2018, the DPA may bring an action against Facebook Belgium, since Facebook Ireland has been identified as the controller of the data concerned. Since that date and by virtue of the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 rule, it appears that, in accordance with Article\u00a056 of Regulation 2016/679, only the Data Protection Commissioner (Ireland) is competent, subject to review only by the Irish courts.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court recalls that, in the judgment of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein\n (C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388), the Court held that the \u2018German supervisory authority\u2019 was competent in respect of data processing where the controller of the data concerned was established in Ireland and the subsidiary that was established in Germany (namely Facebook Germany GmbH) was responsible solely for the sale of advertising spots and other marketing activities in Germany.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in the case that gave rise to that judgment, the Court was required to give a ruling on a request for a preliminary ruling concerning the interpretation of the provisions of Directive 95/46, which has been repealed by Regulation 2016/679. The referring court is uncertain to what extent the Court\u2019s interpretation in that judgment is still of relevance to the application of Regulation 2016/679.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court also mentions a decision of the Bundeskartellamt (the German competition authority) of 6\u00a0February 2019 (the so-called \u2018Facebook\u2019 decision), in which that competition authority took the view that Facebook was abusing its position by merging data from different sources, which is now permitted only if users have given their explicit consent, with the proviso that any user who does not give his or her consent may not be excluded from Facebook services. The referring court notes that the Bundeskartellamt clearly considered itself to be competent, in spite of the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 mechanism.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, the referring court considers that Article\u00a06 of the law of 3\u00a0December 2017, which permits, as a general rule, the DPA, where necessary, to initiate or to engage in legal proceedings, does not imply that the action may, in all circumstances, be brought by the DPA before the Belgian courts, since the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 mechanism appears to require that such an action should be brought before the court with jurisdiction in the place where the data processing is carried out.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the hof van beroep te Brussel (Court of Appeal, Brussels) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should Article\u00a055(1), Articles\u00a056 to 58 and Articles\u00a060 to 66 of [Regulation 2016/679], read together with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the [Charter], be interpreted as meaning that a supervisory authority which, pursuant to national law adopted in implementation of Article\u00a058(5) of that regulation, has the competence to initiate or engage in legal proceedings before a court in its Member State against infringements of that regulation cannot exercise that competence in connection with cross-border data processing if it is not the lead supervisory authority for that cross-border data processing?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the answer to the first question referred differ if the controller of that cross-border data processing does not have its main establishment in that Member State but does have another establishment there?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the answer to the first question referred differ if the national supervisory authority initiates the legal proceedings against the main establishment of the controller in respect of the cross-border data processing rather than against the establishment in its own Member State?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the answer to the first question referred differ if the national supervisory authority had already initiated the legal proceedings before the date on which [Regulation 2016/679] entered into force (25\u00a0May 2018)?\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the first question referred is answered in the affirmative, does Article\u00a058(5) of [Regulation 2016/679] have direct effect, meaning that a national supervisory authority can rely on that provision to initiate or continue legal proceedings against private parties even if Article\u00a058(5) of [Regulation 2016/679] has not been specifically transposed into the legislation of the Member States, notwithstanding the requirement to do so?\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If questions (1) to (5) are answered in the affirmative, could the outcome of such proceedings prevent the lead supervisory authority from making a contrary finding when the lead supervisory authority investigates the same or similar cross-border processing activities in accordance with the mechanism laid down in Articles\u00a056 and 60 of [Regulation 2016/679]?\u2019\n\u00a0\n Consideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether Article\u00a055(1), Articles\u00a056 to 58 and Articles\u00a060 to 66 of Regulation 2016/679, read together with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that a supervisory authority of a Member State which, under the national legislation adopted in order to implement Article\u00a058(5) of that regulation, has the power to bring any alleged infringement of that regulation to the attention of a court of that Member State and, where necessary, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings, may exercise that power with respect to cross-border data processing even though it is not the \u2018lead supervisory authority\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a056(1) of that regulation, in relation to such data processing.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must recalled, as a preliminary point, that, first, unlike Directive 95/46, which had been adopted on the basis of Article\u00a0100\u00a0A of the EC Treaty, concerning the harmonisation of the common market, the legal basis of Regulation 2016/679 is Article\u00a016 TFEU, which enshrines the right of everyone to the protection of personal data concerning them and authorises the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to lay down the rules relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of that data by European Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and by the Member States, when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of EU law, and the rules relating to the free movement of such data. Second, recital\u00a01 of that regulation confirms that \u2018the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right\u2019 and states that Article\u00a08(1) of the Charter and Article\u00a016(1) TFEU lay down the right of everyone to the protection of personal data concerning them.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, as is clear from its Article\u00a01(2), read together with recitals\u00a010, 11 and 13 thereof, Regulation 2016/679 requires the European Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and the competent authorities of the Member States, to ensure a high level of protection of the rights guaranteed in Article\u00a016 TFEU and Article\u00a08 of the Charter.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, as stated in its recital\u00a04, Regulation 2016/679 respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against that background, Article\u00a055(1) of Regulation 2016/679 states the general rule that each supervisory authority is to be competent for the performance of the tasks assigned to it and the exercise of the powers conferred on it, in accordance with that regulation, on the territory of its own Member State (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0147).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the tasks assigned to those supervisory authorities is the task of monitoring the application of Regulation 2016/679 and enforcing its application, as laid down in Article\u00a057(1)(a) of that regulation, while another is the task of cooperating with other supervisory authorities, including sharing information, and providing mutual assistance with a view to ensuring the consistency of application and enforcement of that regulation, as laid down in Article\u00a057(1)(g) of that regulation. The powers conferred on those supervisory authorities, for the performance of those tasks, include various investigative powers, laid down in Article\u00a058(1) of Regulation 2016/679, and the power to bring any infringement of that regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and, where appropriate, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings in order to enforce the provisions of that regulation, as laid down in Article\u00a058(5) of that regulation. \n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The performance of those tasks and the exercise of those powers presupposes, however, that a supervisory authority is competent with respect to a particular instance of data processing.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, without prejudice to the rule on competence set out in Article\u00a055(1) of Regulation 2016/679, Article\u00a056(1) of that regulation establishes, with respect to \u2018cross-border processing\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04, point\u00a0(23), of that regulation, the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 mechanism, based on an allocation of competences between one \u2018lead supervisory authority\u2019 and the other supervisory authorities concerned. Under that mechanism, the supervisory authority of the main establishment or of the single establishment of the controller or processor is to be competent to act as lead supervisory authority for the cross-border processing carried out by that controller or processor, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article\u00a060 of that regulation.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a060 establishes the procedure for cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and the other supervisory authorities concerned. As part of that procedure, the lead supervisory authority is, in particular, required to endeavour to reach consensus. To that end, in accordance with Article\u00a060(3) of Regulation 2016/679, the lead supervisory authority is without delay to submit a draft decision to the other supervisory authorities concerned for their opinion and is to take due account of their views. \n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows more specifically from Articles\u00a056 and 60 of Regulation 2016/679 that, with respect to \u2018cross-border processing\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04, point\u00a0(23), of that regulation, and subject to Article\u00a056(2) thereof, the various national supervisory authorities concerned must cooperate, in accordance with the procedure laid down in those provisions, in order to reach a consensus and a single decision, which is binding on all those authorities and with which decision the controller must ensure compliance as regards processing activities undertaken in the context of all its establishments within the European Union. Further, Article\u00a061(1) of that regulation obliges the supervisory authorities, inter alia, to provide each other with relevant information and mutual assistance in order to implement and apply that regulation in a consistent manner throughout the European Union. Article\u00a063 of Regulation 2016/679 states that it was for that purpose that provision was made for the consistency mechanism, set out in Articles\u00a064 and 65 of that regulation (judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGoogle \n(Territorial scope of de\n-\nreferencing)\n, C-507/17, EU:C:2019:772, paragraph\u00a068).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The application of the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 mechanism consequently requires, as confirmed in recital\u00a013 of Regulation 2016/679, sincere and effective cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and the other supervisory authorities concerned. Accordingly, as the Advocate General stated in point\u00a0111 of his Opinion, the lead supervisory authority may not ignore the views of the other supervisory authorities, and any relevant and reasoned objection made by one of the other supervisory authorities has the effect of blocking, at least temporarily, the adoption of the draft decision of the lead supervisory authority.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in accordance with Article\u00a060(4) of Regulation 2016/679, where one of the other supervisory authorities concerned expresses, within a period of four weeks after having been consulted, such a relevant and reasoned objection to the draft decision, the lead supervisory authority, if it does not follow the relevant and reasoned objection or is of the opinion that that objection is not relevant or reasoned, is to submit the matter to the consistency mechanism provided for in Article\u00a063 of that regulation, in order to obtain a binding decision, adopted on the basis of Article\u00a065(1)(a) of that regulation, from the European Data Protection Board.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a060(5) of Regulation 2016/679, where the lead supervisory authority intends, on the other hand, to follow the relevant and reasoned objection made, it must submit to the other supervisory authorities concerned a revised draft decision for their opinion. That revised draft decision is to be subject to the procedure referred to in Article\u00a060(4) within a period of two weeks.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a060(7) of that regulation, it is the responsibility of the lead supervisory authority, as a general rule, to adopt a decision with respect to the cross-border processing concerned, to give notice of that decision to the main establishment or the single establishment of the controller or processor, as the case may be, and to inform the other supervisory authorities concerned and the European Data Protection Board of the decision in question, including a summary of the relevant facts and grounds.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, it must be noted that Regulation 2016/679 establishes exceptions to the general rule that it is the lead supervisory authority which is competent to adopt decisions in the context of the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 mechanism provided for in Article\u00a056(1) of that regulation.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first of those exceptions is to be found in Article\u00a056(2) of Regulation 2016/679, which provides that a supervisory authority which is not the lead supervisory authority is to be competent to handle a complaint lodged with it concerning a cross-border processing of personal data or a possible infringement of that regulation, if the subject matter relates only to an establishment in its own Member State or substantially affects data subjects only in that Member State.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second exception is in Article\u00a066 of Regulation 2016/679, which provides, by way of derogation from the consistency mechanisms referred to in Articles\u00a060 and Article\u00a063 to 65 of that regulation, for an urgency procedure. That urgency procedure makes it possible, in exceptional circumstances, where the supervisory authority concerned considers that there is an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, immediately to adopt provisional measures intended to produce legal effects on its own territory with a specified period of validity which is not to exceed three months, while Article\u00a066(2) of Regulation 2016/679 further provides that, where a supervisory authority has taken a measure under Article\u00a066(1) and considers that final measures must urgently be adopted, it may request an urgent opinion or an urgent binding decision from the European Data Protection Board, giving reasons for requesting such an opinion or decision.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the exercise of that competence by the supervisory authorities must be compatible with the need for sincere and effective cooperation with the lead supervisory authority, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article\u00a056(3) to (5) of Regulation 2016/679. In such circumstances, under Article\u00a056(3) of that regulation, the supervisory authority concerned must without delay inform the lead supervisory authority, which, within a period of three weeks of being informed, is to decide whether or not it will handle the case.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a056(4) of Regulation 2016/679, where the lead supervisory authority decides to handle the case, the cooperation procedure laid down in Article\u00a060 of that regulation is applicable. In that context, the supervisory authority which informed the lead supervisory authority may submit to the latter a draft for a decision and the latter must take the utmost account of that draft when preparing the draft decision referred to in Article\u00a060(3) of that regulation.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, under Article\u00a056(5) of Regulation 2016/679, where the lead supervisory authority decides not to handle the case, the supervisory authority which informed the former is to handle the case in accordance with Articles\u00a061 and 62 of that regulation, those provisions requiring the supervisory authorities to comply with the rules on mutual assistance and cooperation within the framework of joint operations, in order to ensure effective cooperation between the authorities concerned.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that, first, in relation to the cross-border processing of personal data, the competence of the lead supervisory authority for the adoption of a decision finding that such processing is an infringement of the rules relating to the protection of the rights of natural persons as regards the processing of personal data found in Regulation 2016/679 constitutes the rule, whereas the competence of the other supervisory authorities concerned for the adoption of such a decision, even provisionally, constitutes the exception. Second, while the competence as a general rule of the lead supervisory authority is confirmed in Article\u00a056(6) of Regulation 2016/679, which states that the lead supervisory authority is the \u2018sole interlocutor\u2019 of the controller or processor with respect to the cross-border processing carried out by that controller or that processor, that authority must exercise such competence within a framework of close cooperation with the other supervisory authorities concerned. In particular, the lead supervisory authority cannot, in the exercise of its competences, as stated in paragraph\u00a053 of the present judgment, eschew essential dialogue with and sincere and effective cooperation with the other supervisory authorities concerned. \n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is stated in recital\u00a010 of Regulation 2016/679 that that regulation seeks, inter alia, to ensure consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the freedoms and fundamental rights of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union and to remove obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union. \n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That objective, and the effectiveness of the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 mechanism, might be jeopardised if a supervisory authority which is not, with respect to an instance of cross-border data processing, the lead supervisory authority, could exercise the power laid down in Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 in situations other than those where it has competence for the adoption of a decision as referred to in paragraph\u00a063 of the present judgment. The exercise of that power is indeed intended to lead to a binding judicial decision, which is no less liable to undermine that objective and that mechanism than a decision adopted by a supervisory authority which is not the lead supervisory authority.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contrary to what is claimed by the DPA, the fact that a supervisory authority of a Member State which is not the lead supervisory authority may exercise the power laid down in Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 only when that exercise complies with the rules on the allocation of competences to adopt decisions laid down, in particular, in Articles\u00a055 and 56 of that regulation, read together with Article\u00a060 thereof, is compatible with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter. \n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, as regards the argument concerning an alleged breach of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, it must be recalled that Article\u00a07 guarantees that everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications, whereas Article\u00a08(1) of the Charter, like Article\u00a016(1) TFEU, expressly recognises that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. It is clear, in particular, from Article\u00a051(1) of Regulation 2016/679 that the supervisory authorities are responsible for monitoring the application of that regulation, for the purpose, inter alia, of protecting the fundamental rights of natural persons as regards the processing of their personal data. It follows that, in line with what has been said in paragraph\u00a045 of the present judgment, the rules on the allocation of competences to adopt decisions between the lead supervisory authority and the other supervisory authorities, as laid down by that regulation, take nothing away from the responsibility incumbent on each of those authorities to contribute to a high level of protection of those rights, with due regard to those rules and to the requirements of cooperation and mutual assistance mentioned in paragraph\u00a052 of the present judgment. \n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That means, in particular, that the use of the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 mechanism cannot under any circumstances have the consequence that a national supervisory authority, in particular the lead supervisory authority, does not assume the responsibility incumbent on it under Regulation 2016/679 to contribute to providing effective protection of natural persons from infringements of their fundamental rights as recalled in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment, as otherwise that consequence might encourage the practice of \nforum shopping\n, particularly by data controllers, designed to circumvent those fundamental rights and the practical application of the provisions of that regulation that give effect to those rights. \n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as regards the argument concerning the alleged breach of the right to an effective remedy, guaranteed in Article\u00a047 of the Charter, that argument cannot be accepted either. The manner in which, as set out in paragraphs\u00a064 and 65 of the present judgment, the possibility that a supervisory authority other than the lead supervisory authority may exercise the power laid down in Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679, with respect to an instance of cross-border processing of personal data, is circumscribed takes nothing away from the right of every data subject, laid down in Article\u00a078(1) and (2) of that regulation, to an effective legal remedy, in particular, against a legally binding decision of a supervisory authority concerning him or her, or against a failure by the supervisory authority which has the competence to adopt decisions under Articles\u00a055 and 56 of that regulation, read together with Article\u00a060 thereof, to handle a complaint that that data subject has lodged.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is particularly true in the situation described in Article\u00a056(5) of Regulation 2016/679, by virtue of which, as stated in paragraph\u00a062 of the present judgment, the supervisory authority which has given information on the basis of Article\u00a056(3) of that regulation, may handle the case in accordance with Articles\u00a061 and 62 thereof, where the lead supervisory authority decides, after having been so informed, that it will not itself handle the case. If a case is to be handled in such a way, it is not inconceivable that the supervisory authority concerned may, where appropriate, decide to exercise the power conferred on it by Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, it must be emphasised that the exercise of the power of a Member State\u2019s supervisory authority to bring actions before the courts of that State cannot be ruled out where, after the mutual assistance of the lead supervisory authority has been sought, under Article\u00a061 of Regulation 2016/679, the latter does not provide the former with the requested information. In that situation, under Article\u00a061(8) of that regulation, the supervisory authority concerned may adopt a provisional measure on the territory of its own Member State and, if it considers that there is an urgent need for the adoption of final measures, that authority may, in accordance with Article\u00a066(2) of that regulation, request an urgent opinion or an urgent binding decision from the European Data Protection Board. Further, under Article\u00a064(2) of that regulation, a supervisory authority may request that any matter that is of general application or that produces effects in more than one Member State be examined by the European Data Protection Board with a view to obtaining an opinion, in particular where a competent supervisory authority does not comply with the obligations for mutual assistance imposed on it by Article\u00a061 of that regulation. Following the adoption of such an opinion or such a decision, and provided that the European Data Protection Board approves, after taking account of all the relevant circumstances, the supervisory authority concerned must be able to take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the rules on the protection of the rights of natural persons as regards the processing of personal data contained in Regulation 2016/679 and, for that purpose, exercise the power conferred on it by Article\u00a058(5) of that regulation.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sharing of competences and responsibilities among the supervisory authorities is of necessity underpinned by the existence of sincere and effective cooperation, between those authorities and with the Commission, in order to ensure the correct and consistent application of that regulation, as Article\u00a051(2) of that regulation confirms.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this instance, it will be for the referring court to determine whether the rules on the allocation of competences and the relevant procedures and mechanisms laid down by Regulation 2016/679 have been correctly applied in the main proceedings. In particular, it will be the task of the referring court to ascertain whether, although the DPA is not the lead supervisory authority in this case, the processing in question, to the extent that it involves the conduct of the Facebook online social network subsequent to 25\u00a0May 2018, may be classified as occurring in, in particular, the situation referred to in paragraph\u00a071 of the present judgment.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court observes that the European Data Protection Board, in its Opinion\u00a05/2019 of 12\u00a0March 2019 on the interplay between the [Directive on privacy and electronic communications] and the [General Data Protection Regulation], in particular regarding the competence, tasks and powers of data protection authorities, stated that storing and obtaining access to personal data by means of cookies fell within the scope of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ 2002 L\u00a0201, p.\u00a037), and not within the scope of the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 mechanism. On the other hand, all earlier processing operations, and all subsequent processing activities, with respect to that personal data, by means of other technologies, do fall within the scope of Regulation 2016/679, and consequently within the scope of the \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 mechanism. Given that its request for mutual assistance concerned subsequent personal data processing operations, the DPA in April 2019 asked the Data Protection Commissioner (Ireland) to respond to its request as expeditiously as possible, but no response was provided.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the first question referred is that Article\u00a055(1), Articles\u00a056 to 58 and Articles\u00a060 to 66 of Regulation 2016/679, read together with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that a supervisory authority of a Member State which, under the national legislation adopted in order to transpose Article\u00a058(5) of that regulation, has the power to bring any alleged infringement of that regulation to the attention of a court of that Member State and, where necessary, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings, may exercise that power in relation to an instance of cross-border data processing even though it is not the \u2018lead supervisory authority\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a056(1) of that regulation, with respect to that data processing, provided that that power is exercised in one of the situations where that regulation confers on that supervisory authority a competence to adopt a decision finding that such processing is in breach of the rules contained in that regulation, and that the cooperation and consistency procedures laid down by that regulation are respected.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of cross-border data processing, it is a prerequisite for the exercise of the power of a supervisory authority of a Member State, other than the lead supervisory authority, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings, within the meaning of that provision, that the controller with respect to the cross-border processing of personal data against whom such proceedings are brought has a \u2018main establishment\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04, point\u00a016, of Regulation 2016/679, on the territory of that Member State or another establishment on that territory.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be recalled that, under Article\u00a055(1) of Regulation 2016/679, each supervisory authority is to be competent for the performance of the tasks assigned to it and the exercise of the powers conferred on it, in accordance with that regulation, on the territory of its own Member State. \n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 lays down, further, the power of each supervisory authority to bring any alleged infringement of that regulation to the attention of a court of its Member State and, where appropriate, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings, in order to enforce the provisions of that regulation.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be observed that Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 is worded in general terms and that the EU legislature has not specified that the exercise of that power by a Member State\u2019s supervisory authority is subject to the condition that its legal action should be brought against a controller who has a \u2018main establishment\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04, point\u00a016, of that regulation, or another establishment on the territory of that Member State.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, a Member State\u2019s supervisory authority may exercise the power conferred on it by Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 only if it is demonstrated that that power falls within the territorial scope of that regulation.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03(1) of Regulation 2016/679, which governs the territorial scope of that regulation, provides, in that regard, that the regulation applies to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the European Union, whether or not the processing takes place in the European Union.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, recital\u00a022 of Regulation 2016/679 states that the existence of such an establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements and that the legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in accordance with Article\u00a03(1) of Regulation 2016/679, the territorial scope of that regulation is determined, without prejudice to the situations referred to in paragraphs\u00a02 and 3 of that article, by the condition that the controller or the processor with respect to the cross-border processing has an establishment in the European Union.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently the answer to the second question referred is that Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of cross-border data processing, it is not a prerequisite for the exercise of the power of a supervisory authority of a Member State, other than the lead supervisory authority, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings, within the meaning of that provision, that the controller with respect to the cross-border processing of personal data against whom such proceedings are brought has a main establishment or another establishment on the territory of that Member State.\n\u00a0\nThe third question\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of cross-border data processing, it is a prerequisite of the exercise by a supervisory authority of a Member State, other than the lead supervisory authority, of the power to bring any alleged infringement of that regulation to the attention of a court of that Member State and, where appropriate, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings, within the meaning of that provision, that the supervisory authority concerned directs its legal proceedings against the main establishment of the controller or against the establishment that is located in its own Member State.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from the order for reference that that question has arisen in the context of argument by the parties in relation to the issue whether the referring court has jurisdiction to hear the injunction proceedings in so far as those proceedings are brought against Facebook Belgium, given that, first, within the European Union, the headquarters of the Facebook group is situated in Ireland and that Facebook Ireland is the sole controller with respect to the collection and processing of personal data throughout the European Union, and, second, due to the internal division of that group, the establishment located in Belgium was created, primarily, to allow the Facebook group to engage with the EU institutions and, secondarily, to promote the advertising and marketing of that group to people residing in Belgium.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As stated in paragraph\u00a047 of the present judgment, Article\u00a055(1) of Regulation 2016/679 establishes the competence, as a general rule, of each supervisory authority for the performance of the tasks assigned to it and the exercise of the powers conferred on it, in accordance with that regulation, on the territory of its own Member State.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the power of a supervisory authority of a Member State to bring legal proceedings, within the meaning of Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679, it must be recalled, as the Advocate General stated in point\u00a0150 of his Opinion, that that provision is worded in general terms and that it does not specify against which entities the supervisory authorities should or might direct legal proceedings in relation to any infringement of that regulation.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, that provision does not restrict the exercise of the power to initiate or engage in legal proceedings in such a way that those proceedings can solely be brought against a \u2018main establishment\u2019 or against some other \u2018establishment\u2019 of the controller. On the contrary, under Article\u00a058(5) of that regulation, where the supervisory authority of a Member State has the necessary competence for that purpose, under Articles\u00a055 and 56 of Regulation 2016/679, it may exercise the powers conferred by that regulation on its national territory, irrespective of the Member State in which the controller or its processor is established.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the exercise of the power conferred on each supervisory authority in Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 presupposes that that regulation is applicable. In that regard, and as stated in paragraph\u00a081 of the present judgment, Article\u00a03(1) of that regulation provides that it is applicable to the processing of personal data \u2018in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the [European] Union, whether or not the processing takes place in the [European] Union\u2019.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the objective pursued by Regulation 2016/679, which is to ensure effective protection of the freedoms and fundamental rights of individuals, in particular, their right to protection of privacy and the protection of personal data, the condition that the processing of personal data must be carried out \u2018in the context of the activities\u2019 of the establishment concerned, cannot be interpreted restrictively (see, by analogy, judgment of 5\u00a0June 2018, \nWirtschaftsakademie Schleswig\n-\nHolstein\n, C-210/16, EU:C:2018:388, paragraph\u00a056 and the case-law cited).\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this instance, it is clear from the order for reference and from the written observations lodged by Facebook Belgium that the function of that company is, primarily, to engage with the EU institutions and, secondarily, to promote the advertising and marketing of the Facebook group aimed at people residing in Belgium.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The objective of the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings, which is carried out within the European Union exclusively by Facebook Ireland and which consists in the collection of information on the internet browsing behaviour both of Facebook account holders and of non-users of Facebook services by means of various technologies, such as, inter alia, social plug-ins and pixels, is precisely to enable the social network concerned to make its advertising system more efficient by disseminating targeted communications.\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be observed that, first, a social network such as Facebook generates a substantial proportion of its income from, inter alia, the advertising that is disseminated on that social network, and that the activity carried out by the establishment located in Belgium is intended to ensure, within Belgium, even if it is only a secondary function, the promotion and sale of advertising spots which serve to make Facebook services profitable. Second, the activity primarily carried out by Facebook Belgium, which consists in engaging with the EU institutions and constituting a point of contact for those institutions, seeks, inter alia, to determine the personal data processing policy of Facebook Ireland.\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the activities of the establishment of the Facebook group located in Belgium must be considered to be inextricably linked to the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings, with respect to which Facebook Ireland is the controller within the European Union. Accordingly, that processing must be regarded as being carried out \u2018in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(1) of Regulation 2016/679.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the third question referred is that Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the power of a supervisory authority of a Member State, other than the lead supervisory authority, to bring any alleged infringement of that regulation to the attention of a court of that Member State and, where appropriate, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings, within the meaning of that provision, may be exercised both with respect to the main establishment of the controller which is located in that authority\u2019s own Member State and with respect to another establishment of that controller, provided that the object of the legal proceedings is a processing of data carried out in the context of the activities of that establishment and that that authority is competent to exercise that power, in accordance with the terms of the answer to the first question referred. \n\u00a0\nThe fourth question\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that, where a supervisory authority of a Member State which is not the \u2018lead supervisory authority\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a056(1) of that regulation, has before 25\u00a0May 2018 brought legal proceedings concerning an instance of cross-border processing of personal data, that is, before the date when that regulation became applicable, that fact is such as to affect the conditions governing whether a Member State\u2019s supervisory authority may exercise the power to initiate or engage in legal proceedings conferred on it by Article\u00a058(5).\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The claim made before that court by Facebook Ireland, Facebook Inc. and Facebook Belgium is that the consequence of Regulation 2016/679 becoming applicable after 25\u00a0May 2018 is that the continuation of an action brought before that date is inadmissible, or unfounded.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be noted, first, that Article\u00a099(1) of Regulation 2016/679 provides that that regulation is to enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the \nOfficial \nJournal of the European Union\n. Since that regulation was published in the Official Journal on 4\u00a0May 2016, it therefore entered into force on 25\u00a0May 2016. Further, Article\u00a099(2) of that regulation provides that it is to apply from 25\u00a0May 2018.\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that a new rule of law applies from the entry into force of the act introducing it, and, while it does not apply to legal situations that have arisen and become definitive under the old law, it does apply to their future effects, and to new legal situations. It is otherwise, subject to the principle of the non-retroactivity of legal acts, only if the new rule is accompanied by special provisions which specifically lay down its conditions of temporal application. In particular, procedural rules are generally taken to apply from the date on which they enter into force, as opposed to substantive rules, which are usually interpreted as applying to situations existing before their entry into force only in so far as it follows clearly from their terms, their objectives or their general scheme that such an effect must be given to them (judgment of 25\u00a0February 2021, \nCaisse pour l\u2019avenir des enfants \n(Employment at the time of birth)\n, C-129/20, EU:C:2021:140, paragraph\u00a031 and the case-law cited).\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulation 2016/679 contains no transitional rule nor any other rule governing the status of court proceedings which were initiated before that regulation became applicable and which were still ongoing when it became applicable. In particular, there is no provision of that regulation which states that its effect is to bring to an end all court proceedings that are pending as at 25\u00a0May 2018 concerning alleged infringements of rules governing the processing of personal data laid down by Directive 95/46, even where the conduct that is a constituent element of such alleged infringements persists beyond that date.\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this instance, Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 lays down rules governing the power of a supervisory authority to bring any infringement of that regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and, where appropriate, to initiate or engage otherwise in legal proceedings, in order to enforce the provisions of that regulation.\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, a distinction must be drawn between actions brought by a supervisory authority of a Member State with respect to infringements of the rules for the protection of personal data committed by controllers or processors before the date when Regulation 2016/679 became applicable and actions brought with respect to infringements committed after that date.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first situation, from the perspective of EU law, a legal action, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, may be continued on the basis of the provisions of Directive 95/46, which remains applicable in relation to infringements committed up to the date of its repeal, namely 25\u00a0May 2018. In the second situation, such an action may be brought, under Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679, solely on the condition that, as was stated in the context of the answer to the first question referred, that action is brought in a situation where, exceptionally, that regulation confers on a supervisory authority of a Member State which is not the \u2018lead supervisory authority\u2019 a competence to adopt a decision finding that the processing of data in question is in breach of the rules contained in that regulation with respect to the protection of the rights of natural persons as regard the processing of personal data, with due regard to the procedures laid down by that regulation.\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the fourth question referred is that Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that, where a supervisory authority of a Member State which is not the \u2018lead supervisory authority\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a056(1) of that regulation, has brought a legal action, the object of which is an instance of cross-border processing of personal data, before 25\u00a0May 2018, that is, before the date when that regulation became applicable, that action may, from the perspective of EU law, be continued on the basis of the provisions of Directive 95/46, which remains applicable in relation to infringements of the rules laid down in that directive committed up to the date when that directive was repealed. That action may, in addition, be brought by that authority with respect to infringements committed after that date, on the basis of Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679, provided that that action is brought in one of the situations where, exceptionally, that regulation confers on a supervisory authority of a Member State which is not the \u2018lead supervisory authority\u2019 a competence to adopt a decision finding that the processing of data in question is in breach of the rules contained in that regulation with respect to protection of the rights of natural persons as regard the processing of personal data, and that the cooperation and consistency procedures laid down by that regulation are respected, which it is for the referring court to determine.\n\u00a0\nThe fifth question\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fifth question, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether, if the answer to the first question referred is in the affirmative, Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that that provision has direct effect, with the result that a national supervisory authority may rely on that provision in order to bring or continue a legal action against private parties, even where that provision has not been specifically implemented in the legislation of the Member State concerned.\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 states that each Member State is to provide by law that its supervisory authority is to have the power to bring infringements of this Regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and where appropriate, to initiate or engage otherwise in legal proceedings, in order to enforce the provisions of that regulation.\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, it must be observed that, as submitted by the Belgian Government, Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 has been implemented in the Belgian legal order by Article\u00a06 of the law of 3\u00a0December 2017. Under that Article\u00a06, the wording of which is essentially the same as that of Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679, the DPA has the power to bring any breach of the fundamental principles of the protection of personal data, in the context of that law and legislation containing provisions on the protection of processing of personal data, to the attention of the judicial authorities and, where appropriate, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings to enforce those fundamental principles. Consequently, it must be held that the DPA may rely on a provision of national law, such as Article\u00a06 of the law of 3\u00a0December 2017, which implements Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 in Belgian law, in order to initiate or engage in legal proceedings seeking to enforce that regulation.\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, for the sake of completeness, it must be observed that, under the second paragraph of Article\u00a0288 TFEU, a regulation is to be binding in its entirety and is to be directly applicable in all Member States, so that its provisions do not, as a general rule, require the adoption of any implementing measures by the Member States.\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be recalled that, according to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, pursuant to Article\u00a0288 TFEU and by virtue of the very nature of regulations and of their function in the system of sources of EU law, the provisions of those regulations generally have immediate effect in the national legal systems without its being necessary for the national authorities to adopt measures of application. Nonetheless, some of those provisions may necessitate, for their implementation, the adoption of measures of application by the Member States (judgment of 15\u00a0March 2017, \nAl Chodor\n, C-528/15, EU:C:2017:213, paragraph\u00a027 and the case-law cited).\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as the Advocate General stated, in essence, in point\u00a0167 of his Opinion, Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 lays down a specific and directly applicable rule which states that the supervisory authorities must have legal standing before the national courts and must have the power to initiate or engage in legal proceedings under national law.\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not stated in Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 that Member States should determine by means of an express legal provision under what circumstances the national supervisory authorities may initiate or engage in legal proceedings, within the meaning of Article\u00a058(5). It is sufficient that the supervisory authority should have the possibility, in accordance with national legislation, to bring to the attention of the judicial authorities infringements of that regulation and, where appropriate, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings or to commence, in some other manner, a procedure for the enforcement of the provisions of that regulation.\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the fifth question referred is that Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that that provision has direct effect, with the result that a national supervisory authority may rely on that provision in order to bring or continue a legal action against private parties, even where that provision has not been specifically implemented in the legislation of the Member State concerned.\n\u00a0\nThe sixth question\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its sixth question, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether, in the event that the answer to the questions (1) to (5) referred is in the affirmative, the outcome of legal proceedings brought by a Member State\u2019s supervisory authority in relation to an instance of cross-border processing of personal data may preclude the lead supervisory authority from adopting a decision in which it comes to the opposite conclusion where the latter authority investigates the same cross-border processing activities or similar activities, in accordance with the mechanism laid down in Articles\u00a056 and 60 of Regulation 2016/679.\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, questions on the interpretation of EU law enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to give a ruling on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgments of 16\u00a0June 2015, \nGauweiler and Others\n, C-62/14, EU:C:2015:400, paragraph\u00a025, and of 7\u00a0February 2018, \nAmerican Express\n, C-304/16, EU:C:2018:66, paragraph\u00a032).\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, according to equally settled case-law, the justification for a reference for a preliminary ruling is not that it enables advisory opinions on general or hypothetical questions to be delivered but rather that it is necessary for the effective resolution of a dispute (judgment of 10\u00a0December 2018, \nWightman and Others\n, C-621/18, EU:C:2018:999, paragraph\u00a028 and the case-law cited).\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this instance, it is clear that, as observed by the Belgian Government, the factual premiss of the sixth question referred has not been shown to have any reality in the context of the main proceedings, namely the premiss that, with respect to the cross-border processing that is the object of the dispute, there exists a lead supervisory authority which not only will investigate the same cross-border personal data processing activities as are the object of the legal proceedings initiated by the supervisory authority of the Member State concerned or similar activities, but, further, will contemplate the adoption of a decision that will reach the opposite conclusion.\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it must be stated that the sixth question referred bears no relation to the actual facts of the main proceedings or their purpose, and concerns a hypothetical problem. Consequently, that question must be declared to be inadmissible.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a055(1), Articles\u00a056 to 58 and Articles\u00a060 to 66 of Regulation (EU)\u00a02016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), read together with Articles\u00a07, 8 and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as meaning that a supervisory authority of a Member State which, under the national legislation adopted in order to transpose Article\u00a058(5) of that regulation, has the power to bring any alleged infringement of that regulation to the attention of a court of that Member State and, where necessary, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings, may exercise that power in relation to an instance of cross\n-\nborder data processing even though it is not the \u2018lead supervisory authority\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a056(1) of that regulation, with respect to that data processing, provided that that power is exercised in one of the situations where Regulation 2016/679 confers on that supervisory authority a competence to adopt a decision finding that such processing is in breach of the rules contained in that regulation and that the cooperation and consistency procedures laid down by that regulation are respected.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of cross-border data processing, it is not a prerequisite for the exercise of the power of a supervisory authority of a Member State, other than the lead supervisory authority, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings, within the meaning of that provision, that the controller with respect to the cross-border processing of personal data against whom such proceedings are brought has a main establishment or another establishment on the territory of that Member State.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the power of a supervisory authority of a Member State, other than the lead supervisory authority, to bring any alleged infringement of that regulation to the attention of a court of that Member State and, where appropriate, to initiate or engage in legal proceedings, within the meaning of that provision, may be exercised both with respect to the main establishment of the controller which is located in that authority\u2019s own Member State and with respect to another establishment of that controller, provided that the object of the legal proceedings is a processing of data carried out in the context of the activities of that establishment and that that authority is competent to exercise that power, in accordance with the terms of the answer to the first question referred.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that, where a supervisory authority of a Member State which is not the \u2018lead supervisory authority\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a056(1) of that regulation, has brought a legal action, the object of which is an instance of cross-border processing of personal data, before 25\u00a0May 2018, that is, before the date when that regulation became applicable, that action may, from the perspective of EU law, be continued on the basis of the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, which remains applicable in relation to infringements of the rules laid down in that directive committed up to the date when that directive was repealed. That action may, in addition, be brought by that authority with respect to infringements committed after that date, on the basis of Article\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679, provided that that action is brought in one of the situations where, exceptionally, that regulation confers on a supervisory authority of a Member State which is not the \u2018lead supervisory authority\u2019 a competence to adopt a decision finding that the processing of data in question is in breach of the rules contained in that regulation with respect to the protection of the rights of natural persons as regards the processing of personal data, and that the cooperation and consistency procedures laid down by that regulation are respected, which it is for the referring court to determine.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a058(5) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that that provision has direct effect, with the result that a national supervisory authority may rely on that provision in order to bring or continue a legal action against private parties, even where that provision has not been specifically implemented in the legislation of the Member State concerned."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 30 Jan 2024, C-118/22 (\nDirektor na Glavna direktsia Natsionalna politsia pri

The main ground of that appeal alleges a breach of the principle, inferred from Articles\u00a05, 13 and 14 of Directive 2016/680, that the processing of personal data resulting from their storage cannot be carried on indefinitely. According to NG, in essence, that is de facto the case where, in the absence of a ground for removal from the police register applicable in the event of legal rehabilitation, the data subject can never obtain the erasure of personal data collected in connection with a criminal offence for which he or she was convicted by final judgment, even after serving his or her sentence and having been legally rehabilitated.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in the first place, the referring court notes that entry in the police records constitutes the processing of personal data for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680 and therefore falls within the scope of that directive.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it states that legal rehabilitation is not one of the grounds for removal from the police records, listed exhaustively in Article\u00a068(6) of the Law on the Ministry of the Interior, and that none of those grounds is applicable in that situation, with the result that it is impossible for the data subject to have his entry erased from those police records in such a case.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, the referring court notes that recital\u00a026 of Directive 2016/680 refers to safeguards so that the data collected are not excessive or stored for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed and states that the data controller must set time limits for erasure or periodic review. In addition, it infers from recital\u00a034 of that directive that processing for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) thereof should involve the restriction, erasure or destruction of those data. In its view, those principles are reflected in Article\u00a05 and Article\u00a013(2) and (3) of that directive.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring court has doubts as to whether the objectives set out in the preceding paragraph preclude national legislation which leads, for the competent authorities, to a \u2018virtually unlimited right\u2019 to data processing for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680 and, for the data subject, to the loss of his or her right to the restriction of processing or erasure of his or her data.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Varhoven administrativen sad (Supreme Administrative Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018Does the interpretation of Article\u00a05 in conjunction with Article\u00a013(2)(b) and (3) of [Directive 2016/680], permit national legislative measures which lead to a virtually unrestricted right of competent authorities to process personal data for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and/or to the elimination of the data subject\u2019s right to have the processing of his or her data restricted or to have them erased or destroyed?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the question referred\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to settled case-law, in the procedure laid down by Article\u00a0267 TFEU providing for cooperation between national courts and the Court of Justice, it is for the latter to provide the national court with an answer which will be of use to it and enable it to decide the case before it. To that end, the Court of Justice should, where necessary, reformulate the questions referred to it. The Court may also find it necessary to consider provisions of EU law which the national court has not referred to in its questions (judgment of 15\u00a0July 2021, \nMinistrstvo za obrambo\n, C-742/19, EU:C:2021:597, paragraph\u00a031 and the case-law cited).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the referring court\u2019s question arises from the fact that, as is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling and from the information provided by the Bulgarian Government at the hearing before the Court, none of the grounds justifying the erasure of personal data entered in the police records, exhaustively listed by the Law on the Ministry of the Interior, is applicable in the situation at issue in the main proceedings, in which a person has been convicted by final judgment, even after his or her legal rehabilitation, with the result that those data are stored in that register and may be processed by the authorities which have access to it without any time limit other than the death of that person.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, first of all, it is apparent from the order for reference, in particular from the considerations summarised in paragraph\u00a027 above, and from the wording of the question referred itself that the referring court asks, in particular, whether the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings is compatible with the principle of proportionality. As recital\u00a0104 of Directive 2016/680 highlights, the limitations imposed by that directive on the right to the protection of personal data, provided for in Article\u00a08 of the Charter, and on the right to respect for private and family life and the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, protected by Articles\u00a07 and 47 respectively of the Charter, must be interpreted in accordance with the requirements of Article\u00a052(1) thereof, which include respect for that principle.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, in the wording of its question, the referring court rightly refers to Article\u00a05 of that directive, relating to appropriate time limits for the erasure of personal data or for a periodic review of the need for the storage of personal data. Since Article\u00a05 is closely connected both with Article\u00a04(1)(c) and (e) of that directive and with Article\u00a016(2) and (3) thereof, the question referred for a preliminary ruling must be understood as also referring to those two provisions.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, since the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings provides for the storage, inter alia, of biometric and genetic data, which fall within the special categories of personal data the processing of which is specifically governed by Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, it must be held that the question referred also concerns the interpretation of that provision.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, the relevance of an interpretation of Article\u00a013 of Directive 2016/680 emerges clearly from the request for a preliminary ruling only as regards paragraph\u00a02(b) of that article. It is true, as the referring court points out, that Article\u00a013(3) also reflects the principles set out, inter alia, in recital\u00a026 of that directive. However, it does not appear from the file submitted to the Court that a legislative measure delaying or restricting the provision of information to the data subject, within the meaning of Article\u00a013(3), is also at issue in the main proceedings.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, it must be held that, by its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a04(1)(c) and (e) of Directive 2016/680, read in conjunction with Articles\u00a05 and 10, Article\u00a013(2)(b) and Article\u00a016(2) and (3) thereof, and in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides for the storage, by police authorities, for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, of personal data, including biometric and genetic data, concerning persons who have been convicted by final judgment of an intentional criminal offence subject to public prosecution, until the death of the data subject, even in the event of his or her legal rehabilitation, without also granting that person the right to have those data erased or, where appropriate, to have their processing restricted.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the question referred concerns the processing of personal data for purposes falling, in accordance with Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, within the scope of that directive. It is apparent, however, from Article\u00a027 of the Law on the Ministry of the Interior, cited in the order for reference, that the data stored in the police register may also be processed in the context of the protection of national security, to which, under Article\u00a02(3)(a) of Directive 2016/680, read in the light of recital\u00a014 thereof, that directive does not apply. It will therefore be for the referring court to satisfy itself that the storage of the data of the applicant in the main proceedings is not capable of serving purposes relating to the protection of national security, given that Article\u00a02(3)(a) of Directive 2016/680 lays down an exception to the application of EU law which must be interpreted strictly (see, by analogy, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a062 and the case-law cited).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it should be borne in mind that the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society and be weighed against other fundamental rights. Any limitation on the exercise of those fundamental rights must, in accordance with Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, be provided for by law, respect the essence of those fundamental rights and observe the principle of proportionality. Under the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others. They must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary and the legislation which entails the limitations in question must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of those limitations (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a0105 and the case-law cited).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As stated, in essence, in recital\u00a026 of Directive 2016/680, those requirements are not met where the objective of general interest pursued can reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights of the persons concerned (see, by analogy, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a0110 and the case-law cited).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, first of all, under Article\u00a04(1)(c) of that directive, Member States are to provide for personal data to be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. That provision thus requires the Member States to observe the principle of \u2018data minimisation\u2019, which gives expression to the principle of proportionality (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a098 and the case-law cited).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in particular, the collection of personal data in the context of criminal proceedings and their storage by police authorities, for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of that directive, must, like any processing falling within the scope of that directive, comply with those requirements. Such storage also constitutes an interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, irrespective of whether or not the information stored is sensitive, whether or not the persons concerned have been inconvenienced in any way on account of that interference, or whether or not the stored data will subsequently be used (see, by analogy, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a044 and the case-law cited).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as regards, more specifically, the proportionality of the period for which the data will be stored, the Member States must, pursuant to Article\u00a04(1)(e) of Directive 2016/680, provide that those data are to be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data are processed.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, Article\u00a05 of that directive requires the Member States to provide for the establishment of appropriate time limits for the erasure of personal data or for a periodic review of the need for the storage of those data and procedural measures to ensure that those time limits are observed.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As stated in recital\u00a026 of Directive 2016/680, that provision seeks to ensure that personal data are not, in accordance with the requirements of Article\u00a04(1)(e) of that directive, kept longer than is necessary. It is true that Directive 2016/680 leaves it to the Member States to set appropriate time limits on the storage period and to decide whether those time limits concern the erasure of those data or the periodic review of the need to store them, provided that the observance of those time limits is ensured by adequate procedural measures. However, the \u2018appropriate\u2019 nature of those periods requires, in any event, that\u00a0\u2013 in accordance with Article\u00a04(1)(c) and (e) of that directive, read in the light of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter\u00a0\u2013 those time limits allow, where appropriate, the erasure of the data concerned where their storage is no longer necessary for the purposes which justified the processing.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is, in particular, in order to enable data subjects to verify that \u2018appropriate\u2019 nature and, if necessary, to request such erasure that Article\u00a013(2)(b) and Article\u00a014(d) of Directive 2016/680 provide that, in principle, those persons are to be informed, where possible, of the period for which their personal data will be stored or, if that is not possible, of the criteria used to determine that period.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 constitutes a specific provision governing the processing of special categories of personal data, including biometric and genetic data. The purpose of that article is to ensure enhanced protection of the data subject, since the data in question, because of their particular sensitivity and the context in which they are processed, are liable, as is apparent from recital\u00a037 of that directive, to create significant risks to fundamental rights and freedoms, such as the right to respect for private life and the right to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter (judgment of 26\u00a0January 2023, \nMinisterstvo na vatreshnite raboti (Recording of biometric and genetic data by the police)\n, C-205/21, EU:C:2023:49, paragraph\u00a0116 and the case-law cited).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 lays down the requirement that the processing of sensitive data be allowed \u2018only where strictly necessary\u2019, which constitutes a strengthened condition for the lawful processing of such data and entails, inter alia, a particularly strict review of compliance with the principle of \u2018data minimisation\u2019, as derived from Article\u00a04(1)(c) of Directive 2016/680; that requirement constitutes a specific application of that principle to those sensitive data (see, to that effect, judgment of 26\u00a0January 2023, \nMinisterstvo na vatreshnite raboti (Recording of biometric and genetic data by the police\n), C-205/21, EU:C:2023:49, paragraphs\u00a0117, 122 and 125).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, Article\u00a016(2) of Directive 2016/680 establishes a right to erasure of personal data where the processing infringes the provisions adopted pursuant to Article\u00a04, 8 or 10 of that directive or where those data must be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from Article\u00a016(2) of Directive 2016/680 that that right to erasure may be exercised, inter alia, where the storage of the personal data in question is not or is no longer necessary for the purposes for which they are processed, in breach of the provisions of national law implementing Article\u00a04(1)(c) and (e) of that directive and, as the case may be, Article\u00a010 thereof, or where that erasure is required in order to comply with the time limit set, for that purpose, by national law pursuant to Article\u00a05 of that directive.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, pursuant to Article\u00a016(3) of Directive 2016/680, national law must provide that the data controller is to restrict the processing of those data instead of erasing them where, in accordance with point (a) of that provision, the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject and their accuracy or inaccuracy cannot be ascertained, or where, in accordance with point (b) of that provision, the personal data must be maintained for the purposes of evidence.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that the provisions of Directive 2016/680 examined in paragraphs\u00a041 to 51 above establish a general framework to ensure, inter alia, that the storage of personal data and, more specifically, the period of storage, are limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which those data are stored, while leaving it to the Member States to determine, in compliance with that framework, the specific situations in which the protection of the fundamental rights of the data subject requires the erasure of those data and the time at which those data must be erased. However, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point\u00a028 of his Opinion, those provisions do not require the Member States to define absolute time limits for the storage of personal data, beyond which those data must be automatically erased.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that the personal data entered in the police records pursuant to Article\u00a068 of the Law on the Ministry of the Interior are stored only for operational investigation purposes and, more specifically, for the purpose of comparison with other data collected during investigations into other offences.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in the first place, it should be noted that the storage, in police records, of data relating to persons who have been convicted by final judgment may prove necessary for the purposes indicated in the preceding paragraph, even after the conviction in question has been erased from the criminal record and, consequently, the effects which national legislation attaches to that conviction are repealed. Those persons may be involved in criminal offences other than those for which they were convicted or, on the contrary, they may be exonerated through the comparison of the data stored by those authorities with the data collected during the proceedings relating to those other offences.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, such storage may contribute to the objective of general interest set out in recital\u00a027 of Directive 2016/680, which states that, for the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, it is necessary for competent authorities to process personal data collected in the context of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of specific criminal offences beyond that context in order to develop an understanding of criminal activities and to make links between different criminal offences detected (see, to that effect, judgment of 26\u00a0January 2023, \nMinisterstvo na vatreshnite raboti (Recording of biometric and genetic data by the police)\n, C-205/21, EU:C:2023:49, paragraph\u00a098).\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that the data stored in the police records are the data relating to the data subject referred to in the Bulgarian legislation on identity documents, his or her fingerprints, his or her photograph, a DNA sample taken for profiling purposes and, as the Bulgarian Government confirmed at the hearing, the data relating to the criminal offences committed by the data subject and to his or her convictions in that regard. Those various categories of data may prove essential for the purposes of verifying whether the data subject is involved in criminal offences other than those in respect of which he or she has been convicted by final judgment. Consequently, they may be regarded, in principle, as adequate and relevant in relation to the purposes for which they are processed, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1)(c) of Directive 2016/680.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, the proportionality of such storage in the light of its purposes must be assessed taking into account also the appropriate technical and organisational measures laid down by national law, which are intended to ensure the confidentiality and security of the stored data with regard to processing contrary to the requirements of Directive 2016/680, in accordance with Articles\u00a020 and 29 of that directive, and in particular the measures referred to in Article\u00a020(2) thereof, ensuring that only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fourth place, as regards the period for which the personal data at issue in the main proceedings are stored, it is apparent, in the present case, from the request for a preliminary ruling that it is only in the event that the data subject is convicted by final judgment of an intentional criminal offence subject to public prosecution that the data in question are stored until that person\u2019s death, since the national legislation provides for the removal of the entries of persons accused of such a criminal offence in other cases.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be stated, however, that the concept of an \u2018intentional criminal offence subject to public prosecution\u2019 is particularly general and is liable to apply to a large number of criminal offences, irrespective of their nature and gravity (see, to that effect, judgment of 26\u00a0January 2023, \nMinisterstvo na vatreshnite raboti (Recording of biometric and genetic data by the police)\n, C-205/21, EU:C:2023:49, paragraph\u00a0129).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General also observed, in essence, in points\u00a073 and 74 of his Opinion, persons convicted by final judgment of a criminal offence falling within the scope of that concept do not all present the same degree of risk of being involved in other criminal offences, justifying a uniform period of storage of the data relating to them. Thus, in certain cases, in the light of factors such as the nature and seriousness of the offence committed or the absence of recidivism, the risk represented by the convicted person will not necessarily justify maintaining the data relating to him in the national police records provided for that purpose until his death. In such cases, there will no longer be a necessary connection between the data stored and the objective pursued (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017 (EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0205). Accordingly, the storage of such data will not comply with the principle of data minimisation set out in Article\u00a04(1)(c) of Directive 2016/680 and will exceed the period necessary for the purposes for which they are processed, contrary to Article\u00a04(1)(e) of that directive.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be noted, in that regard, that, admittedly, as the Advocate General stated, in essence, in point\u00a070 of his Opinion, the legal rehabilitation of such a person, resulting in the erasure of his or her conviction from his or her criminal record, such as occurred in the main proceedings, cannot, by itself, render unnecessary the storage of his or her data in the police records, since the purposes of that storage are different from those of the recording of his or her convictions in that criminal record. However, where, as in the present case, under the applicable provisions of national criminal law, such legal rehabilitation is conditional upon the fact that the person concerned has not committed any further intentional criminal offence subject to public prosecution for a certain period of time after the sentence has been served, it may constitute an indication that the person concerned presents a lower risk with regard to the objectives of combating crime or maintaining public order and may therefore be a factor liable to reduce the period for which that storage is necessary.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fifth place, the principle of proportionality, set out in Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, entails, in particular, a balancing of the importance of the objective pursued and the seriousness of the limitation placed on the exercise of the fundamental rights in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0November 2022, \nLuxembourg Business Registers\n, C-37/20 and C-601/20, EU:C:2022:912, paragraph\u00a066).\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, as noted in paragraph\u00a035 above, the storage of personal data in the police register at issue includes biometric and genetic data. It must therefore be pointed out that, having regard to the significant risks posed by the processing of such sensitive data to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular in the context of the tasks of the competent authorities for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, the specific importance of the objective pursued must be assessed in the light of a number of relevant factors. Such factors include, inter alia, the fact that the processing serves a specific objective connected with the prevention of criminal offences or threats to public security displaying a certain degree of seriousness, the punishment of such offences or protection against such threats, and the specific circumstances in which that processing is carried out (judgment of 26\u00a0January 2023, \nMinisterstvo na vatreshnite raboti (Recording of biometric and genetic data by the police)\n, C-205/21, EU:C:2023:49, paragraph\u00a0127).\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the Court has held that national legislation which provides for the systematic collection of the biometric and genetic data of any person accused of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution is, in principle, contrary to the requirement of strict necessity laid down in Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 and referred to in paragraph\u00a048 above. Such legislation is liable to lead, in an indiscriminate and generalised manner, to the collection of the biometric and genetic data of most accused persons (see, to that effect, judgment of 26\u00a0January 2023, \nMinisterstvo na vatreshnite raboti (Recording of biometric and genetic data by the police)\n, C-205/21, EU:C:2023:49, paragraphs\u00a0128 and 129).\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the European Court of Human Rights, it has held that the blanket and indiscriminate nature of the powers of retention of the fingerprints, cellular samples and DNA profiles of persons suspected but not convicted of offences, as provided for by the national legislation at issue in the case before that court, failed to strike a fair balance between the competing public and private interests and that, accordingly, the retention of those data constituted a disproportionate interference with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for private life and could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society; that interference thus constituted a violation of Article\u00a08 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950 (ECtHR, 4\u00a0December 2008, \nS. and Marper v. the United Kingdom\n, CE:ECHR:2008:1204JUD003056204, \u00a7\u00a7 125 and 126).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that the storage of the biometric and genetic data of persons who have already been convicted by final judgment, even until the death of those persons, may be strictly necessary, within the meaning of Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, in particular in order to enable the possible involvement of those persons in other criminal offences to be verified and, accordingly, to prosecute and convict the perpetrators of those offences. It is necessary to have regard to the importance of that type of data for criminal investigations, even many years after the events, in particular where the offences in question constitute serious crimes (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 13\u00a0February 2020, \nGaughran v. the United Kingdom\n, CE:ECHR:2020:0213JUD004524515, \u00a7 93).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the storage of biometric and genetic data can be regarded as meeting the requirement that it is to be allowed only \u2018where strictly necessary\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, only if it takes into consideration the nature and seriousness of the offence which led to the final criminal conviction, or other circumstances such as the particular context in which that offence was committed, its possible connection with other ongoing proceedings or the background or profile of the convicted person. Accordingly, where national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, provides that the biometric and genetic data of data subjects entered in the police records is\u00a0\u2013 in the event that those persons are convicted by final judgment\u00a0\u2013 to be stored until the death of those persons, the scope of that storage is, as stated in paragraphs\u00a059 and 60 above, excessively broad with regard to the purposes for which those data are processed.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the sixth place, as regards, first, the obligation imposed on Member States to provide for the establishment of appropriate time limits, set out in Article\u00a05 of Directive 2016/680, it should be noted that, for the reasons set out in paragraphs\u00a059, 60 and 67 above and having regard to the requirements of Article\u00a04(1)(c) and (e) and Article\u00a010 of that directive, a time limit can be regarded as \u2018appropriate\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a05 of that directive, in particular as regards the storage of the biometric and genetic data of any person convicted by final judgment of an intentional criminal offence subject to public prosecution, only if it takes into consideration the relevant circumstances which might require such a storage period, such as those referred to in paragraph\u00a067 above.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, even if the reference, in the national legislation, to the death of the data subject may constitute a \u2018time limit\u2019 for the erasure of stored data, within the meaning of Article\u00a05 of Directive 2016/680, such a time limit can be regarded as \u2018appropriate\u2019 only in specific circumstances which duly justify it. That is clearly not the case where it is applicable generally and indiscriminately to any person convicted by final judgment.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true, as pointed out in paragraph\u00a045 above, that Article\u00a05 of Directive 2016/680 leaves it to the Member States to decide whether time limits must be established concerning the erasure of those data or the periodic review of the need for their storage. However, it is also apparent from that paragraph that the \u2018appropriate\u2019 nature of the time limits for such a periodic review requires that they allow, in accordance with Article\u00a04(1)(c) and (e) of that directive, read in the light of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, the erasure of the data at issue, where their storage is no longer necessary. For the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph, that requirement is not satisfied where, as in the present case, the national legislation provides for such erasure, as regards a person convicted by final judgment of an intentional criminal offence subject to public prosecution, only in the event of that person\u2019s death.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, secondly, the guarantees provided for in Article\u00a016(2) and (3) of that directive, concerning the conditions relating to the rights to erasure and to the restriction of processing, it follows from paragraphs\u00a050 and 51 above that those provisions also preclude national legislation which does not allow a person convicted by final judgment of an intentional criminal offence subject to public prosecution to exercise those rights.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Article\u00a04(1)(c) and (e) of Directive 2016/680, read in conjunction with Articles\u00a05 and 10, Article\u00a013(2)(b) and Article\u00a016(2) and (3) thereof, and in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides for the storage, by police authorities, for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, of personal data, including biometric and genetic data, concerning persons who have been convicted by final judgment of an intentional criminal offence subject to public prosecution, until the death of the data subject, even in the event of his or her legal rehabilitation, without imposing on the data controller the obligation to review periodically whether that storage is still necessary, nor granting that data subject the right to have those data erased, where their storage is no longer necessary for the purposes for which they are processed or, where appropriate, to have the processing of those data restricted.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a04(1)(c) and (e) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA, read in conjunction with Articles\u00a05 and 10, Article\u00a013(2)(b) and Article\u00a016(2) and (3) thereof, and in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nmust be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides for the storage, by police authorities, for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, of personal data, including biometric and genetic data, concerning persons who have been convicted by final judgment of an intentional criminal offence subject to public prosecution, until the death of the data subject, even in the event of his or her legal rehabilitation, without imposing on the data controller the obligation to review periodically whether that storage is still necessary, nor granting that data subject the right to have those data erased, where their storage is no longer necessary for the purposes for which they are processed or, where appropriate, to have the processing of those data restricted."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}
