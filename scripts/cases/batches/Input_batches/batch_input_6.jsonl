By letter of 28 November 2005 it made an application to the Juzgado de lo Mercantil No 5 de Madrid (Commercial Court No 5, Madrid) for preliminary measures against Telef\u00f3nica, a commercial company whose activities include the provision of internet access services.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Promusicae asked for Telef\u00f3nica to be ordered to disclose the identities and physical addresses of certain persons whom it provided with internet access services, whose IP address and date and time of connection were known. According to Promusicae, those persons used the KaZaA file exchange program (peer-to-peer or P2P) and provided access in shared files of personal computers to phonograms in which the members of Promusicae held the exploitation rights.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Promusicae claimed before the national court that the users of KaZaA were engaging in unfair competition and infringing intellectual property rights. It therefore sought disclosure of the above information in order to be able to bring civil proceedings against the persons concerned.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By order of 21 December 2005 the Juzgado de lo Mercantil No 5 de Madrid ordered the preliminary measures requested by Promusicae.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Telef\u00f3nica appealed against that order, contending that under the LSSI the communication of the data sought by Promusicae is authorised only in a criminal investigation or for the purpose of safeguarding public security and national defence, not in civil proceedings or as a preliminary measure relating to civil proceedings. Promusicae submitted for its part that Article 12 of the LSSI must be interpreted in accordance with various provisions of Directives 2000/31, 2001/29 and 2004/48 and with Articles 17(2) and 47 of the Charter, provisions which do not allow Member States to limit solely to the purposes expressly mentioned in that law the obligation to communicate the data in question.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the Juzgado de lo Mercantil No 5 de Madrid decided to stay the proceedings and refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018Does Community law, specifically Articles 15(2) and 18 of Directive [2000/31], Article 8(1) and (2) of Directive [2001/29], Article 8 of Directive [2004/48] and Articles 17(2) and 47 of the Charter \u2026 permit Member States to limit to the context of a criminal investigation or to safeguard public security and national defence, thus excluding civil proceedings, the duty of operators of electronic communications networks and services, providers of access to telecommunications networks and providers of data storage services to retain and make available connection and traffic data generated by the communications established during the supply of an information society service?\u2019\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility of the question referred\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its written observations the Italian Government submits that the statements in point 11 of the order for reference indicate that the question referred would be justified only in the event that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings were interpreted as limiting the duty to disclose personal data to the field of criminal investigations or the protection of public safety and national defence. Since the national court does not exclude the possibility of that legislation being interpreted as not containing such a limitation, the question thus appears, according to the Italian Government, to be hypothetical, so that it is inadmissible.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it should be recalled that, in the context of the cooperation between the Court of Justice and the national courts provided for by Article 234 EC, it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court (Case C-217/05 \nConfederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Empresarios de Estaciones de Servicio\n [2006] ECR I-11987, paragraph 16 and the case-law cited).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where questions submitted by national courts concern the interpretation of a provision of Community law, the Court of Justice is thus bound, in principle, to give a ruling unless it is obvious that the request for a preliminary ruling is in reality designed to induce the Court to give a ruling by means of a fictitious dispute, or to deliver advisory opinions on general or hypothetical questions, or that the interpretation of Community law requested bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, or that the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (see \nConfederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Empresarios de Estaciones de Servicio\n, paragraph 17).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, as regards the division of responsibilities under the cooperative arrangements established by Article 234 EC, the interpretation of provisions of national law is admittedly a matter for the national courts, not for the Court of Justice, and the Court has no jurisdiction, in proceedings brought on the basis of that article, to rule on the compatibility of national rules of law with Community law. On the other hand, the Court does have jurisdiction to provide the national court with all the guidance as to the interpretation of Community law necessary to enable that court to rule on the compatibility of national rules with Community law (see, to that effect, Case C-506/04 \nWilson\n [2006] ECR I-8613, paragraphs 34 and 35, and Joined Cases C-338/04, C-359/04 and C-360/04 \nPlacanica and Others\n [2007] ECR I-1891, paragraph 36).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in the case of the present reference for a preliminary ruling, it is perfectly clear from the grounds of the order for reference as a whole that the national court considers that the interpretation of Article 12 of the LSSI depends on the compatibility of that provision with the relevant provisions of Community law, and hence on the interpretation of those provisions which it asks the Court to provide. Since the outcome of the main proceedings is thus linked to that interpretation, the question referred clearly does not appear hypothetical, so that the ground of inadmissibility put forward by the Italian Government cannot be accepted.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reference for a preliminary ruling is therefore admissible.\n\u00a0\nThe question referred for a preliminary ruling\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its question the national court asks essentially whether Community law, in particular Directives 2000/31, 2001/29 and 2004/48, read also in the light of Articles 17 and 47 of the Charter, must be interpreted as requiring Member States to lay down, in order to ensure effective protection of copyright, an obligation to communicate personal data in the context of civil proceedings.\n\u00a0\nPreliminary observations\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if, formally, the national court has limited its question to the interpretation of Directives 2000/31, 2001/29 and 2004/48 and the Charter, that circumstance does not prevent the Court from providing the national court with all the elements of interpretation of Community law which may be of use for deciding the case before it, whether or not that court has referred to them in the wording of its question (see Case C-392/05 \nAlevizos\n [2007] ECR I-3505, paragraph 64 and the case-law cited).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be observed to begin with that the intention of the provisions of Community law thus referred to in the question is that the Member States should ensure, especially in the information society, effective protection of industrial property, in particular copyright, which Promusicae claims in the main proceedings. The national court proceeds, however, from the premiss that the Community law obligations required by that protection may be blocked, in national law, by the provisions of Article 12 of the LSSI.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While that law, in 2002, transposed the provisions of Directive 2000/31 into domestic law, it is common ground that Article 12 of the law is intended to implement the rules for the protection of private life, which is also required by Community law under Directives 95/46 and 2002/58, the latter of which concerns the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, which is the sector at issue in the main proceedings.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not disputed that the communication sought by Promusicae of the names and addresses of certain users of KaZaA involves the making available of personal data, that is, information relating to identified or identifiable natural persons, in accordance with the definition in Article 2(a) of Directive 95/46 (see, to that effect, Case C-101/01 \nLindqvist\n [2003] ECR I-12971, paragraph 24). That communication of information which, as Promusicae submits and Telef\u00f3nica does not contest, is stored by Telef\u00f3nica constitutes the processing of personal data within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 2 of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article 2(b) of Directive 95/46. It must therefore be accepted that that communication falls within the scope of Directive 2002/58, although the compliance of the data storage itself with the requirements of that directive is not at issue in the main proceedings.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it should first be ascertained whether Directive 2002/58 precludes the Member States from laying down, with a view to ensuring effective protection of copyright, an obligation to communicate personal data which will enable the copyright holder to bring civil proceedings based on the existence of that right. If that is not the case, it will then have to be ascertained whether it follows directly from the three directives expressly mentioned by the national court that the Member States are required to lay down such an obligation. Finally, if that is not the case either, in order to provide the national court with an answer of use to it, it will have to be examined, starting from the national court\u2019s reference to the Charter, whether in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings other rules of Community law might require a different reading of those three directives.\n\u00a0\nDirective 2002/58\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 5(1) of Directive 2002/58 provides that Member States must ensure the confidentiality of communications by means of a public communications network and publicly available electronic communications services, and of the related traffic data, and must inter alia prohibit, in principle, the storage of that data by persons other than users, without the consent of the users concerned. The only exceptions relate to persons lawfully authorised in accordance with Article 15(1) of that directive and the technical storage necessary for conveyance of a communication. In addition, as regards traffic data, Article 6(1) of Directive 2002/58 provides that stored traffic data must be erased or made anonymous when it is no longer needed for the purpose of the transmission of a communication without prejudice to paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of that article and Article 15(1) of the directive.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect, first, to paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of Article 6, which relate to the processing of traffic data in accordance with the requirements of billing and marketing services and the provision of value added services, those provisions do not concern the communication of that data to persons other than those acting under the authority of the providers of public communications networks and publicly available electronic communications services. As to the provisions of Article 6(6) of Directive 2002/58, they do not relate to disputes other than those between suppliers and users concerning the grounds for storing data in connection with the activities referred to in the other provisions of that article. Since Article 6(6) thus clearly does not concern a situation such as that of Promusicae in the main proceedings, it cannot be taken into account in assessing that situation.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect, second, to Article 15(1) of Directive 2002/58, it should be recalled that under that provision the Member States may adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope inter alia of the obligation to ensure the confidentiality of traffic data, where such a restriction constitutes a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society to safeguard national security (i.e. State security), defence, public security, and the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of unauthorised use of the electronic communications system, as referred to in Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 15(1) of Directive 2002/58 thus gives Member States the possibility of providing for exceptions to the obligation of principle, imposed on them by Article 5 of that directive, to ensure the confidentiality of personal data.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, none of these exceptions appears to relate to situations that call for the bringing of civil proceedings. They concern, first, national security, defence and public security, which constitute activities of the State or of State authorities unrelated to the fields of activity of individuals (see, to that effect, \nLindqvist\n, paragraph 43), and, second, the prosecution of criminal offences.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the exception relating to unauthorised use of the electronic communications system, this appears to concern use which calls into question the actual integrity or security of the system, such as the cases referred to in Article 5(1) of Directive 2002/58 of the interception or surveillance of communications without the consent of the users concerned. Such use, which, under that article, makes it necessary for the Member States to intervene, also does not relate to situations that may give rise to civil proceedings.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear, however, that Article 15(1) of Directive 2002/58 ends the list of the above exceptions with an express reference to Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46. That provision also authorises the Member States to adopt legislative measures to restrict the obligation of confidentiality of personal data where that restriction is necessary inter alia for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. As they do not specify the rights and freedoms concerned, those provisions of Article 15(1) of Directive 2002/58 must be interpreted as expressing the Community legislature\u2019s intention not to exclude from their scope the protection of the right to property or situations in which authors seek to obtain that protection in civil proceedings.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The conclusion must therefore be that Directive 2002/58 does not preclude the possibility for the Member States of laying down an obligation to disclose personal data in the context of civil proceedings.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the wording of Article 15(1) of that directive cannot be interpreted as compelling the Member States, in the situations it sets out, to lay down such an obligation.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must therefore be ascertained whether the three directives mentioned by the national court require those States to lay down that obligation in order to ensure the effective protection of copyright.\n\u00a0\nThe three directives mentioned by the national court\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should first be noted that, as pointed out in paragraph 43 above, the purpose of the directives mentioned by the national court is that the Member States should ensure, especially in the information society, effective protection of industrial property, in particular copyright. However, it follows from Article 1(5)(b) of Directive 2000/31, Article 9 of Directive 2001/29 and Article 8(3)(e) of Directive 2004/48 that such protection cannot affect the requirements of the protection of personal data.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 8(1) of Directive 2004/48 admittedly requires Member States to ensure that, in the context of proceedings concerning an infringement of an intellectual property right and in response to a justified and proportionate request of the claimant, the competent judicial authorities may order that information on the origin and distribution networks of the goods or services which infringe an intellectual property right be provided. However, it does not follow from those provisions, which must be read in conjunction with those of paragraph 3(e) of that article, that they require the Member States to lay down, in order to ensure effective protection of copyright, an obligation to communicate personal data in the context of civil proceedings.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does the wording of Articles 15(2) and 18 of Directive 2000/31 or that of Article 8(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29 require the Member States to lay down such an obligation.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to Articles 41, 42 and 47 of the TRIPs Agreement, relied on by Promusicae, in the light of which Community law must as far as possible be interpreted where \u2013 as in the case of the provisions relied on in the context of the present reference for a preliminary ruling \u2013 it regulates a field to which that agreement applies (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-300/98 and C-392/98 \nDior and Others\n [2000] ECR I-11307, paragraph 47, and Case C-431/05 \nMerck Gen\u00e9ricos \u2013 Produtos Farmac\u00eauticos\n [2007] ECR I-0000, paragraph 35), while they require the effective protection of intellectual property rights and the institution of judicial remedies for their enforcement, they do not contain provisions which require those directives to be interpreted as compelling the Member States to lay down an obligation to communicate personal data in the context of civil proceedings.\n\u00a0\nFundamental rights\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national court refers in its order for reference to Articles 17 and 47 of the Charter, the first of which concerns the protection of the right to property, including intellectual property, and the second of which concerns the right to an effective remedy. By so doing, that court must be regarded as seeking to know whether an interpretation of those directives to the effect that the Member States are not obliged to lay down, in order to ensure the effective protection of copyright, an obligation to communicate personal data in the context of civil proceedings leads to an infringement of the fundamental right to property and the fundamental right to effective judicial protection.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be recalled that the fundamental right to property, which includes intellectual property rights such as copyright (see, to that effect, Case C-479/04 \nLaserdisken\n [2006] ECR I-8089, paragraph 65), and the fundamental right to effective judicial protection constitute general principles of Community law (see respectively, to that effect, Joined Cases C-154/04 and C-155/04 \nAlliance for Natural Health and Others\n [2005] ECR I-6451, paragraph 126 and the case-law cited, and Case C-432/05 \nUnibet\n [2007] ECR I-2271, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited).\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the situation in respect of which the national court puts that question involves, in addition to those two rights, a further fundamental right, namely the right that guarantees protection of personal data and hence of private life.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to recital 2 in the preamble to Directive 2002/58, the directive seeks to respect the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter. In particular, the directive seeks to ensure full respect for the rights set out in Articles 7 and 8 of that Charter. Article 7 substantially reproduces Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed at Rome on 4 November 1950, which guarantees the right to respect for private life, and Article 8 of the Charter expressly proclaims the right to protection of personal data.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The present reference for a preliminary ruling thus raises the question of the need to reconcile the requirements of the protection of different fundamental rights, namely the right to respect for private life on the one hand and the rights to protection of property and to an effective remedy on the other.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mechanisms allowing those different rights and interests to be balanced are contained, first, in Directive 2002/58 itself, in that it provides for rules which determine in what circumstances and to what extent the processing of personal data is lawful and what safeguards must be provided for, and in the three directives mentioned by the national court, which reserve the cases in which the measures adopted to protect the rights they regulate affect the protection of personal data. Second, they result from the adoption by the Member States of national provisions transposing those directives and their application by the national authorities (see, to that effect, with reference to Directive 95/46, \nLindqvist\n, paragraph 82).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to those directives, their provisions are relatively general, since they have to be applied to a large number of different situations which may arise in any of the Member States. They therefore logically include rules which leave the Member States with the necessary discretion to define transposition measures which may be adapted to the various situations possible (see, to that effect, \nLindqvist\n, paragraph 84).\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, the Member States must, when transposing the directives mentioned above, take care to rely on an interpretation of the directives which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order. Further, when implementing the measures transposing those directives, the authorities and courts of the Member States must not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with those directives but also make sure that they do not rely on an interpretation of them which would be in conflict with those fundamental rights or with the other general principles of Community law, such as the principle of proportionality (see, to that effect, \nLindqvist\n, paragraph 87, and Case C-305/05 \nOrdre des barreaux francophones et germanophone and Others\n [2007] ECR I-0000, paragraph 28).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it should be recalled here that the Community legislature expressly required, in accordance with Article 15(1) of Directive 2002/58, that the measures referred to in that paragraph be adopted by the Member States in compliance with the general principles of Community law, including those mentioned in Article 6(1) and (2) EU.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the national court\u2019s question must be that Directives 2000/31, 2001/29, 2004/48 and 2002/58 do not require the Member States to lay down, in a situation such as that in the main proceedings, an obligation to communicate personal data in order to ensure effective protection of copyright in the context of civil proceedings. However, Community law requires that, when transposing those directives, the Member States take care to rely on an interpretation of them which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order. Further, when implementing the measures transposing those directives, the authorities and courts of the Member States must not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with those directives but also make sure that they do not rely on an interpretation of them which would be in conflict with those fundamental rights or with the other general principles of Community law, such as the principle of proportionality.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\nDirective 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (\u2018Directive on electronic commerce\u2019), Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, and Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) do not require the Member States to lay down, in a situation such as that in the main proceedings, an obligation to communicate personal data in order to ensure effective protection of copyright in the context of civil proceedings. However, Community law requires that, when transposing those directives, the Member States take care to rely on an interpretation of them which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order. Further, when implementing the measures transposing those directives, the authorities and courts of the Member States must not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with those directives but also make sure that they do not rely on an interpretation of them which would be in conflict with those fundamental rights or with the other general principles of Community law, such as the principle of proportionality."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Article\u00a03 of that directive, entitled \u2018Scope\u2019, was worded as follows:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive shall apply to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means, and to the processing otherwise than by automatic means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive shall not apply to the processing of personal data:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the [EU Treaty, in the version in force prior to the Treaty of Lisbon,] and in any case to processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the processing operation relates to State security matters) and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law,\n\u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe GDPR\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a08 to 10, 13, 16, 45 and 155 of the GDPR state:\n\u2018(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where this Regulation provides for specifications or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States may, as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to whom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into their national law.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The objectives and principles of Directive [95/46] remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation of data protection across the [European] Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences in the implementation and application of Directive [95/46].\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation. In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive [95/46], Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the processing of special categories of personal data (\u201csensitive data\u201d). To that extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.\n\u2026\n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators\u00a0\u2026 to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(16)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms or the free flow of personal data related to activities which fall outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national security. This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the Union.\n\u2026\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, the processing should have a basis in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not require a specific law for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also be for Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore, that law could specify the general conditions of this Regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications for determining the controller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing, the data subjects concerned, the entities to which the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(155)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member State law or collective agreements, including \u201cworks agreements\u201d, may provide for specific rules on the processing of employees\u2019 personal data in the employment context, in particular for the conditions under which personal data in the employment context may be processed on the basis of the consent of the employee, the purposes of the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including discharge of obligations laid down by law or by collective agreements, management, planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the workplace, health and safety at work, and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment, on an individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment, and for the purpose of the termination of the employment relationship.\u2019\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01 of the GDPR, entitled \u2018Subject matter and objectives\u2019, provides:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.\u2019\n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a02 of that regulation, entitled \u2018Material scope\u2019, provides in paragraphs\u00a01 and 2:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Chapter 2 of Title V of the [EU Treaty];\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.\u2019\n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04 of that regulation, entitled \u2018Definitions\u2019, provides:\n\u2018For the purposes of this Regulation:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cpersonal data\u201d means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d);

The free nature of consent may be established, in particular, if there is a legal or economic advantage for the employee, or if the employer and the employee have convergent interests. Consent must be made in writing unless another form is required because of special circumstances.

That framework made it possible, inter alia, for pupils who could not be present in a classroom to attend classes live by videoconference. In order to safeguard pupils\u2019 rights in relation to the protection of personal data, it was established that connection to the videoconference service would be authorised only with the consent of the pupils themselves or, for those pupils who were minors, of their parents. However, no provision was made for the consent of the teachers concerned to their participation in that service.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Principal Staff Committee for Teachers at the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Land Hessen brought an action before the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court, Wiesbaden, Germany), complaining that the live streaming of classes by videoconference was not made conditional on the consent of the teachers concerned.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Minister for Education and Culture of the Land Hessen, for his part, contended that the processing of personal data inherent in the live streaming of classes by videoconference was covered by the first sentence of Paragraph\u00a023(1) of the HDSIG, so that it could be conducted without the consent of the teachers concerned being sought.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court, Wiesbaden) states in that regard that, in accordance with the intention of the legislature of the Land Hessen, Paragraph\u00a023 of the HDSIG and Paragraph\u00a086 of the HBG fall within the category of \u2018more specific rules\u2019 for which Member States may make provision, in accordance with Article\u00a088(1) of the GDPR, to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees\u2019 personal data in the employment context. However, that court has doubts as to whether the first sentence of Paragraph\u00a023(1) of the HDSIG and Paragraph\u00a086(4) of the HBG are compatible with the requirements laid down in Article\u00a088(2) of the GDPR.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, the first sentence of Paragraph\u00a023(1) of the HDSIG and Paragraph\u00a086(4) of the HBG rely on \u2018necessity\u2019 as the legal basis for the processing of employees\u2019 data. However, the insertion of the principle of \u2018necessity\u2019 into that law does not constitute a rule specifying the requirements contained in Article\u00a088(2) of the GDPR, since the processing of data necessary in the context of an employment relationship is already governed by point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the first sentence of Paragraph\u00a023(1) of the HDSIG applies, beyond the actual contractual relationship, to any processing of employees\u2019 data. It follows from point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR that, in the case of personal data processing going beyond processing that is strictly necessary under the employment contract, the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, in the present case the employees and civil servants, must be balanced with the legitimate interest pursued by the controller, in the present case the employer. In so far as the first sentence of Paragraph\u00a023(1) of the HDSIG does not provide for such a balancing exercise, that provision cannot be regarded as a specific sectoral norm after the entry into force of the GDPR.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court, Wiesbaden) considers that the mere reference in Paragraph\u00a023(5) of the HDSIG to the fact that the controller must, inter alia, comply with the principles set out in Article\u00a05 of the GDPR does not meet the requirements of Article\u00a088(2) of that regulation. The latter provision requires suitable and specific legislative provisions to be adopted in order to protect the data subjects\u2019 human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights, with particular regard to the transparency of processing, the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, and monitoring systems at the work place, and is not merely a rule which must additionally be complied with by those who apply a national provision. Those who apply the provision are not the addressees of Article\u00a088(2) of the GDPR.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court, Wiesbaden) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a088(1) of [the GDPR] to be interpreted as meaning that, in order to be a more specific rule for ensuring the protection of the rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees\u2019 personal data in the employment context within the meaning of Article\u00a088(1) of [the GDPR], a provision must meet the requirements imposed on such rules by Article\u00a088(2) of [the GDPR]?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If a national rule clearly does not meet the requirements under Article\u00a088(2) of [the GDPR], can it nevertheless remain applicable?\u2019\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By a communication received at the Court Registry on 30\u00a0November 2021, the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court, Wiesbaden) informed the Court that, as a result of amendments to the national legislation governing the territorial jurisdiction of the administrative courts of the Land Hessen, which was to take effect on 1\u00a0December 2021, the dispute in the main proceedings had been transferred to the Verwaltungsgericht Frankfurt am Main (Administrative Court, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). By a communication received at the Court Registry on 21\u00a0February 2022, the latter court confirmed that transfer and informed the Court of the new role number assigned to the dispute in the main proceedings.\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility of the request for a preliminary ruling\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its written observations, the German Government submitted that the request for a preliminary ruling was inadmissible in so far as the questions referred for a preliminary ruling were not relevant to the outcome of the dispute in the main proceedings. The Court\u2019s answer would not be useful to the referring court if the processing of the data were authorised by reason of the teacher\u2019s consent. However, the referring court does not explain why it does not take such a possibility into account.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When questioned on this point at the hearing before the Court, the German Government nevertheless acknowledged that the questions referred for a preliminary ruling were relevant where the teacher\u2019s consent could not be obtained.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, according to settled case-law, questions referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court in the legislative and factual context which that court is responsible for defining, and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court of Justice to determine, enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 1\u00a0August 2022, \nVyriausioji tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija\n, C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601, paragraph\u00a048 and the case-law cited).\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that the parties to the main proceedings disagree as to whether the introduction of live streaming of a class by videoconference systems requires, not only the consent of the parents for their children or that of the pupils who have attained majority, but also the consent of the teachers concerned, or whether, on the other hand, the processing of their personal data is covered by the first sentence of Paragraph\u00a023(1) of the HDSIG and Paragraph\u00a086(4) of the HBG.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court, Wiesbaden) stated in its request for a preliminary ruling, first, that the national legislature considered that Paragraph\u00a023 of the HDSIG and Paragraph\u00a086 of the HBG constitute more specific rules within the meaning of Article\u00a088 of the GDPR and, second, that the outcome of the dispute in the main proceedings depends on whether the first sentence of Paragraph\u00a023(1) of the HDSIG and Paragraph\u00a086(4) of the HBG satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a088 of the GDPR, so as to constitute more specific rules applicable to the processing of the personal data of teachers when classes are livestreamed by the videoconference system at issue in the main proceedings.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the information thus provided in the request for a preliminary ruling, the arguments put forward by the German Government are not capable of rebutting the presumption of relevance enjoyed by the questions referred.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the view cannot be taken either that the interpretation of the provisions of EU law that is sought clearly bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, or that the problem is hypothetical, since the referring court is likely to take that interpretation into account for the purposes of resolving the dispute in the main proceedings. Lastly, the Court has before it the factual and legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore the request for a preliminary ruling is admissible.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\u00a0\nPreliminary observations\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The questions referred for a preliminary ruling concern the interpretation of Article\u00a088(1) and (2) of the GDPR in a dispute relating to the processing of teachers\u2019 personal data during the live streaming by videoconference of the public educational classes which they are responsible for providing.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it must be determined whether that processing falls within the material scope of the GDPR, having regard to the fact that, under Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR, that regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data carried out \u2018in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law\u2019 and that, in accordance with Article\u00a0165(1) TFEU, Member States are responsible for the content of teaching and the organisation of their education systems.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is clear from the case-law of the Court that the definition of the material scope of the GDPR, as set out in Article\u00a02(1) of that regulation, is very broad and that the exceptions to that scope, as provided for in Article\u00a02(2) thereof, must be interpreted restrictively (see, to that effect, judgments of 9\u00a0July 2020, \nLand \nHessen\n, C-272/19, EU:C:2020:535, paragraph\u00a068, and of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraphs\u00a061 and 62). \n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR is to be read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(2)(b) and recital\u00a016 of that regulation, which states that that regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data in the context of \u2018activities which fall outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national security\u2019 and \u2018activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the Union\u2019 (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a063).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that Article\u00a02(2)(a) and (b) of the GDPR, which partly represents a continuation of the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, cannot be interpreted in broader terms than the exception resulting from the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, a provision which already excluded from that directive\u2019s scope, inter alia, the processing of personal data taking place in the course \u2018of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the [EU Treaty, in the version in force prior to the Treaty of Lisbon,] and in any case\u00a0\u2026 processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security\u2019 (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a064). \n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is common ground that the activity relating to the organisation of teaching in the Land Hessen cannot be classified in the category of activities intended to preserve national security, referred to in Article\u00a02(2)(a) of the GDPR.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the processing of teachers\u2019 personal data as part of the live streaming by videoconference of the public educational classes which they provide, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, falls within the material scope of the GDPR.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling that teachers whose personal data processing is at issue in the main proceedings are part of the public service of the Land Hessen, as employees or civil servants.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether such processing of personal data falls within the scope of Article\u00a088 of the GDPR, which refers to \u2018the processing of employees\u2019 personal data in the employment context\u2019.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be pointed out that the GDPR does not define the terms \u2018employees\u2019 and \u2018employment\u2019, nor does it refer to the law of the Member States to define those terms. In the absence of any such reference, it should be recalled that, as follows from the need for a uniform application of EU law and from the principle of equality, the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union (judgment of 2\u00a0June 2022, \nHK\n/\nDanmark \nand \nHK\n/\nPrivat\n, C-587/20, EU:C:2022:419, paragraph\u00a025 and the case-law cited).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, since the GDPR does not define the terms \u2018employed\u2019 and \u2018employment\u2019, they must be interpreted by reference to their usual meaning in everyday language, while also taking into account the context in which they occur and the purposes of the rules of which they are part (judgment of 2\u00a0June 2022, \nHK/ \nDanmark \nand \nHK/ \nPrivat\n, C-587/20, EU:C:2022:419, paragraph\u00a026 and the case-law cited).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The term \u2018employee\u2019 in its usual meaning refers to a person who performs his or her work in the context of a relationship of subordination with his or her employer and therefore under the latter\u2019s control (judgment of 18\u00a0March 2021, \nKuoni Travel\n, C-578/19, EU:C:2021:213, paragraph\u00a042).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, the essential feature of an \u2018employment relationship\u2019 is that for a certain period of time a person performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he or she receives remuneration (judgment of 15\u00a0July 2021, \nMinistrstvo za obrambo\n, C-742/19, EU:C:2021:597, paragraph\u00a049).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since such a characteristic is specific to employees and to employment both in the public and in the private sector, it must be inferred that the terms \u2018employee\u2019 and \u2018employment\u2019, understood in their usual sense, do not exclude persons who pursue their professional activity in the public sector.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scope of Article\u00a088(1) of the GDPR cannot be determined by reference to the nature of the legal relationship that binds the employee to the employer. Thus, it is irrelevant whether the data subject is employed as an employee or as a civil servant, or even whether the terms on which he or she is employed come under public or private law, since those legal designations are varied at the whim of national legislatures and cannot therefore provide an appropriate criterion for a uniform and autonomous interpretation of that provision (see, by analogy, judgments of 12\u00a0February 1974, \nSotgiu\n, 152/73, EU:C:1974:13, paragraph\u00a05, and of 3\u00a0June 1986, \nCommission\n v \nFrance\n, 307/84, EU:C:1986:222, paragraph\u00a011).\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specifically with regard to persons whose employment relationship is not an employment contract, such as civil servants, it is true that Article\u00a088 of the GDPR refers, in paragraph\u00a01, to the \u2018performance of the contract of employment\u2019. However, it should be noted, first, that that reference is among other purposes of the processing of personal data in the employment context which may be the subject of more specific rules adopted by the Member States, listed in Article\u00a088(1) of the GDPR, and that, in any event, that list is not exhaustive, as is demonstrated by the adverbial phrase \u2018in particular\u2019 used in that provision. \n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the irrelevance of the classification of the legal relationship between the employee and the administration employing that employee is borne out by the fact that the management, planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the workplace, health and safety at work, the protection of employer\u2019s or customer\u2019s property, the exercise and enjoyment, on an individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment, and the termination of the employment relationship, which are also listed in Article\u00a088(1) of the GDPR, relate to employment in both the private and the public sectors. \n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, it cannot be inferred from the reference to the \u2018performance of the contract of employment\u2019 in Article\u00a088(1) of the GDPR that employment in the public sector that is not based on an employment contract is excluded from the scope of that provision. \n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same conclusion must be reached in relation to the fact that Article\u00a088(2) of the GDPR mentions, among the three factors to which the Member States must have \u2018particular regard\u2019 when adopting those \u2018more specific rules\u2019, the transfer of personal data \u2018within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity\u2019. The other two factors, namely the transparency of processing and monitoring systems at the work place, are relevant both to employment in the private sector and to employment in the public sector, whatever the nature of the legal relationship that binds the employee to the employer.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The interpretation arising from the wording of Article\u00a088 of the GDPR is confirmed by the context of that article and by the objective pursued by the legislation of which it forms part. \n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from Article\u00a01(1) of the GDPR, read in the light, inter alia, of recitals\u00a09, 10 and 13, that regulation seeks to ensure the harmonisation of national legislation on the protection of personal data which is, in principle, complete. However, the provisions of that regulation make it possible for Member States to lay down additional, stricter or derogating national rules and leave them a margin of discretion as to the manner in which those provisions may be implemented (\u2018opening clauses\u2019) (see, to that effect, judgment of 28\u00a0April 2022, \nMeta Platforms Ireland\n, C-319/20, EU:C:2022:322, paragraph\u00a057).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a088 of the GDPR, which forms part of Chapter IX of that regulation entitled \u2018Provisions relating to specific processing situations\u2019, constitutes such an opening clause, since it gives Member States the option of adopting \u2018more specific rules\u2019 to ensure protection of the rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees\u2019 personal data in the employment context.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The specific features of the processing of personal data in the employment context and, consequently, the option given to Member States by Article\u00a088(1) of the GDPR are explained, in particular, by the existence of a relationship of subordination between the employee and the employer and not by the nature of the legal relationship that binds the employee to the employer.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, under Article\u00a01(2) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with recital\u00a010, that regulation has the objective in particular of ensuring a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with respect to the processing of personal data; that right is also recognised in Article\u00a08 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and is closely connected to the right to respect for private life, enshrined in Article\u00a07 of that charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0August 2022, \nVyriausioji tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija\n, C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601, paragraph\u00a061).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is consistent with that objective to apply a broad interpretation of Article\u00a088(1) of the GDPR, according to which the \u2018more specific rules\u2019 which the Member States may lay down to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees\u2019 personal data in the employment context are likely to apply to all employees, irrespective of the nature of the legal relationship that binds them to their employer.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the processing of teachers\u2019 personal data during the live streaming, by videoconference, of the public educational classes which they provide, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, falls within the material and personal scope of the GDPR.\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a088 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, in order to be classified as a more specific rule within the meaning of paragraph\u00a01 of that article, a rule of law must satisfy the conditions laid down in paragraph\u00a02 of that article.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As has been pointed out in paragraph\u00a052 above, the Member States have the option, and not the obligation, to adopt such rules, which may be provided for by law or by means of collective agreements.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, when the Member States exercise the option granted to them by the opening clause of the GDPR, they must use their discretion under the conditions and within the limits laid down by the provisions of that regulation and must therefore legislate in such a way as not to undermine the content and objectives of that regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 28\u00a0April 2022, \nMeta Platforms Ireland\n, C-319/20, EU:C:2022:322, paragraph\u00a060).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to determine the conditions and limits to which the rules referred to in Article\u00a088(1) and (2) of the GDPR are subject and, consequently, to assess the discretion left to the Member States by those provisions, it must be recalled that, in accordance with settled case-law, the interpretation of a provision of EU law requires account to be taken not only of its wording, but also of its context and the objectives and purpose pursued by the act of which it forms part (judgment of 15\u00a0March 2022, \nAutorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers\n, C-302/20, EU:C:2022:190, paragraph\u00a063).\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the wording of Article\u00a088(1) of the GDPR, it is apparent, first of all, from the use of the words \u2018more specific\u2019 that the rules referred to in that provision must have a normative content specific to the area regulated, which is distinct from the general rules of that regulation.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, as has been pointed out in paragraph\u00a052 above, the objective of the rules adopted on the basis of that provision is to protect employees\u2019 rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of their personal data in the employment context.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, it follows from the different purposes for which the processing of personal data may be carried out, as set out in Article\u00a088(1) of the GDPR, that the \u2018more specific rules\u2019 to which it refers may relate to a very large number of processing operations in connection with an employment relationship, so as to cover all the purposes for which the processing of personal data may be carried out in the context of an employment relationship. Furthermore, since the listing of those objectives is not exhaustive, as has been pointed out in paragraph\u00a046 above, the Member States have a margin of discretion as regards the processing which is thus subject to those more specific rules. \n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a088 of the GDPR provides, in paragraph\u00a02, that the rules adopted on the basis of paragraph\u00a01 are to include suitable and specific measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights, having particular regard to the transparency of processing, the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, and monitoring systems at the work place.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it is apparent from the wording of Article\u00a088 of the GDPR that paragraph\u00a02 of that article circumscribes the discretion of those Member States which intend to adopt \u2018more specific rules\u2019 under paragraph\u00a01 of that article. Therefore, first, those rules cannot be limited to reiterating the provisions of that regulation and must seek to protect employees\u2019 rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of their personal data in the employment context and include suitable and specific measures to protect the data subjects\u2019 human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, particular regard must be had to the transparency of processing, the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, and monitoring systems at the work place.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the context of Article\u00a088 of the GDPR, it should be noted, in the first place, that that provision must be interpreted in the light of recital\u00a08 of that regulation, according to which, where that regulation provides for specifications or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States may, as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to whom they apply, incorporate elements of that regulation into their national law.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it must be borne in mind that Chapters II and III of the GDPR set out, respectively, the principles governing the processing of personal data and the rights of the data subject with which any processing of personal data must comply (judgment of 24\u00a0February 2022, \nValsts ie\u0146\u0113mumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)\n, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraph\u00a050).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, all processing of personal data must comply, first, with the principles relating to processing of data set out in Article\u00a05 of the GDPR and, second, with one of the principles relating to lawfulness of processing listed in Article\u00a06 of that regulation (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a096 and the case-law cited).\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the principles relating to the lawfulness of processing, Article\u00a06 of the GDPR sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of the cases in which processing of personal data can be regarded as lawful. Thus, in order to be capable of being regarded as legitimate, processing must fall within one of the cases provided for in Article\u00a06 (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021,\n Latvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a099 and the case-law cited).\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, although, when exercising the option granted to them by an opening clause of the GDPR, Member States may, as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to whom they apply, incorporate elements of that regulation into their national law, the \u2018more specific rules\u2019, adopted on the basis of Article\u00a088(1) of that regulation, cannot be limited to a reiteration of the conditions for the lawfulness of personal data processing and the principles of that processing, set out, respectively, in Article\u00a06 and Article\u00a05 of that regulation, or to a reference to those conditions and principles.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The interpretation that the discretion of the Member States, when adopting rules on the basis of Article\u00a088(1) of the GDPR, is limited by paragraph\u00a02 of that article, is consistent with the objective of that regulation, recalled in paragraph\u00a051 above, which is to ensure the harmonisation of national legislation on the protection of personal data which is, in principle, complete.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in points\u00a056, 70 and 73 of his Opinion, the possibility for Member States to adopt \u2018more specific rules\u2019 on the basis of Article\u00a088(1) of the GDPR may lead to a lack of harmonisation within the scope of those rules. The conditions imposed by Article\u00a088(2) of that regulation reflect the limits of the differentiation accepted by that regulation, in that that lack of harmonisation may be accepted only where the differences that remain are accompanied by specific and suitable safeguards intended to protect employees\u2019 rights and freedoms with regard to the processing of their personal data in the employment context.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, in order to be classified as a \u2018more specific rule\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a088(1) of the GDPR, a rule of law must satisfy the conditions laid down in paragraph\u00a02 of that article. Apart from having a normative content specific to the area regulated, which is distinct from the general rules of that regulation, those more specific rules must seek to protect employees\u2019 rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of their personal data in the employment context and include suitable and specific measures to protect the data subjects\u2019 human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights. Particular regard must be had to the transparency of processing, the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, and monitoring systems at the work place.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a088 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that national legislation cannot constitute a \u2018more specific rule\u2019, within the meaning of paragraph\u00a01 of that article, where it does not satisfy the conditions laid down in paragraph\u00a02 of that article.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, what conclusions should be drawn from a finding that national provisions adopted to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees\u2019 personal data in the employment context are incompatible with the conditions and limits laid down in Article\u00a088(1) and (2) of the GDPR.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, under the second paragraph of Article\u00a0288 TFEU, a regulation is to be binding in its entirety and is to be directly applicable in all Member States, so that its provisions do not, as a general rule, require the adoption of any implementing measures by the Member States (judgment of 15\u00a0June 2021, \nFacebook Ireland and Others\n, C-645/19, EU:C:2021:483, paragraph\u00a0109).\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as has been recalled in paragraph\u00a051 above, opening clauses provided for by the GDPR allow Member States the possibility of laying down additional, stricter or derogating national rules and leave them a margin of discretion as to the way in which the provisions concerned may be implemented.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As has been noted in paragraph\u00a059 above, when the Member States exercise the option granted to them by an opening clause of the GDPR, they must use their discretion under the conditions and within the limits laid down by the provisions of that regulation and must therefore legislate in such a way as not to undermine the content and objectives of that regulation.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for the referring court, which alone has jurisdiction to interpret national law, to assess whether the provisions at issue in the main proceedings comply with the conditions and limits laid down in Article\u00a088 of the GDPR, as summarised in paragraph\u00a074 above.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as the Advocate General observed in points\u00a060 to 62 of his Opinion, provisions such as Paragraph\u00a023(1) of the HDSIG and Paragraph\u00a086(4) of the HBG, which make the processing of employees\u2019 personal data subject to the condition that such processing is necessary for certain purposes connected with the performance of an employment relationship, appear to reiterate the condition for general lawfulness of processing already set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, without adding a more specific rule within the meaning of Article\u00a088(1) of that regulation. Indeed, such provisions do not appear to have a normative content specific to the area regulated, which is distinct from the general rules of that regulation.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the referring court were to find that the provisions at issue in the main proceedings do not comply with the conditions and limits laid down in Article\u00a088 of the GDPR, it would, in principle, be required to disregard those provisions. \n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with the principle of the primacy of EU law, provisions of the Treaties and directly applicable measures of the institutions have the effect, in their relations with the internal law of the Member States, merely by entering into force, of rendering automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of national law (judgments of 9\u00a0March 1978, \nSimmenthal\n, 106/77, EU:C:1978:49, paragraph\u00a017; of 19\u00a0June 1990, \nFactortame and Others\n, C-213/89, EU:C:1990:257, paragraph\u00a018; and of 4\u00a0February 2016, \nInce\n, C-336/14, EU:C:2016:72, paragraph\u00a052).\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in the absence of more specific rules that comply with the conditions and limits prescribed by Article\u00a088 of the GDPR, the processing of personal data in the employment context, both in the private and public sectors, is directly governed by the provisions of that regulation.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that points (c) and (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, under which the processing of personal data is lawful where that processing is necessary, respectively, for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller, may apply to the processing of personal data such as that at issue in the main proceedings.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06(3) of the GDPR provides, first, with regard to those two situations where processing is lawful, referred to respectively in points (c) and (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, that the processing must be based on EU law or on Member State law to which the controller is subject and adds, secondly, that the purposes of the processing are to be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1), are to be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller (see, to that effect, judgment of 8\u00a0December 2022, \nInspektor v Inspektorata kam Visshia sadeben savet \n(Purposes of the processing of personal data\u00a0\u2013 Criminal investigation)\n, C-180/21, EU:C:2022:967, paragraph\u00a095).\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be pointed out that the Court has already held that lawful processing of personal data by the controllers on the basis of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR presupposes not only that they can be regarded as performing a task carried out in the public interest, but also that the processing of personal data for the purpose of performing such a task is founded on a legal basis referred to in Article\u00a06(3) of that regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 20\u00a0October 2022, \nKoalitsia \u2018Demokratichna Bulgaria\u00a0\u2013 Obedinenie\u2019\n, C-306/21, EU:C:2022:813, paragraph\u00a052).\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, where the referring court finds that the national provisions on the processing of personal data in the employment context do not comply with the conditions and limits laid down in Article\u00a088(1) and (2) of the GDPR, it must still verify whether those provisions constitute a legal basis referred to in Article\u00a06(3) of that regulation, read in conjunction with recital\u00a045, which complies with the requirements laid down in that regulation. If that is the case, the national provisions must not be disregarded.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the second question referred for a preliminary ruling is that Article\u00a088(1) and (2) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the application of national provisions adopted to ensure the protection of employees\u2019 rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of their personal data in the employment context must be disregarded where those provisions do not comply with the conditions and limits laid down in Article\u00a088(1) and (2), unless those provisions constitute a legal basis referred to in Article\u00a06(3) of that regulation, which complies with the requirements laid down by that regulation.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a088 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\nmust be interpreted as meaning that national legislation cannot constitute a \u2018more specific rule\u2019, within the meaning of paragraph\u00a01 of that article, where it does not satisfy the conditions laid down in paragraph\u00a02 of that article.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a088(1) and (2) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the application of national provisions adopted to ensure the protection of employees\u2019 rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of their personal data in the employment context must be disregarded where those provisions do not comply with the conditions and limits laid down in Article\u00a088(1) and (2), unless those provisions constitute a legal basis referred to in Article\u00a06(3) of that regulation, which complies with the requirements laid down by that regulation."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

As provision of a transcript to an individual is connected with satisfying the private interests of that individual, it is a service in respect of which, under Article 229(1)(b) of the Gemeentewet, payment of a fee may be required.\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court observes that (i) certified transcripts of personal data are the only ones to be officially recognised and used by the public authorities and (ii) the provision of data from municipal files falls within the scope of Directive 95/46, regardless of the basis, in national law, for the request for access to such data.\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to that court, Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 guarantees every data subject the right to obtain, without constraint, at reasonable intervals and without excessive delay or expense, communication to him in an intelligible form of the personal data undergoing processing and of any available information as to their source. That court is also of the view that Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 can be construed in two ways:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the communication of personal data must take place without excessive delay or excessive expense, or\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the communication of personal data must take place without excessive delay and without expense.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the former case, it is permissible to levy a fee, so long as it is not excessive. In the latter case, levying a fee is prohibited.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the issue of whether the fee in question is excessive, the referring court observes that, under Article 229b of the Gemeentewet, the rates are to be set in such a way that the income from that fee does not exceed the related expenditure. However, that is no guarantee that the income from fees will not be higher than the expenditure related to the communication of personal data. The referring court is also uncertain as to the exact point at which fees levied may be regarded as excessive for the purposes of Article 12(a) of Directive\u00a095/46.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If it is found that Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that personal data is to be communicated free of charge, the referring court is uncertain as to whether it is necessary to provide an alternative to the provision of a transcript which must be paid for pursuant to Article\u00a079(3) of the Wet GBA, perhaps by allowing data to be viewed on a display screen. However, it points out that access to a display screen does not constitute a communication for the purposes of Article\u00a012(a) of the directive and that Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019) protects only the right to access data. Access to data via a display screen has the additional disadvantage that, unlike a certified transcript, it cannot be accepted as authentic and accurate by the public authorities (Case C-553/07 \nRijkeboer\n [2009] ECR I-3889) and cannot provide a historical overview of the data registered.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Gerechtshof te\u2019s-Hertogenbosch decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the provision of access [to data] (pursuant to Article 79(2) of the Wet GBA) constitute compliance with the obligation [to communicate] data undergoing processing as referred to in the second indent of Article 12(a) of Directive [95/46/EC]?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does Article 12(a) of [that directive] preclude the levying of fees in respect of the communication, by means of a transcript from the municipal database, of the personal data undergoing processing?\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question 2 is to be answered in the negative: is the levying of the present fee excessive [for the purposes of] Article 12(a) of [that directive]?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nQuestion 2\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, which it is appropriate to examine first, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as precluding the levying of fees in respect of the communication of personal data by a public authority.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the Member States which have submitted written observations to the Court maintain, as does the European Commission, that Article\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46 allows public authorities to require payment of fees in respect of the communication of personal data referred to in that provision, so long as those fees are not excessive.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be pointed out that the Dutch-language version of Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 uses the phrase \u2018bovenmatige vertraging of kosten\u2019. That wording might be thought to suggest that the adjective \u2018bovenmatige\u2019 (\u2018excessive\u2019) relates only to delays (\u2018vertraging\u2019), thereby suggesting that the right to obtain communication of the data referred to in that provision should not be subject to the payment of fees.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, for the purposes of its interpretation, Article 12(a) of Directive\u00a095/46 cannot be examined solely in the Dutch-language version: according to settled case-law, the need for the uniform application of an EU measure and, accordingly, for a uniform interpretation of that measure makes it impossible to consider one version of the text in isolation, but requires that it be interpreted on the basis of both the real intention of its author and the aim which the latter seeks to achieve, in the light, in particular, of the versions in all languages (see, inter alia, Case 29/69 \nStauder\n [1969] ECR I-419, paragraph 3; Case C-280/04 \nJyske Finans\n [2005] ECR I-10683, paragraph 31; and Case C-445/09 \nIMC Securities\n [2011] ECR I-5917, paragraph 25).\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is nothing in the non-Dutch-language versions of Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 to suggest that Member States are required to communicate the information referred to in that provision free of charge. On the contrary, other versions of that provision \u2013 for example, the Spanish (\u2018sin retrasos ni gastos excesivos\u2019), Danish (\u2018uden st\u00f8rre ventetid eller st\u00f8rre udgifter\u2019), German (\u2018ohne unzumutbare Verz\u00f6gerung oder \u00fcberm\u00e4\u03b2iger Kosten\u2019), French (\u2018sans d\u00e9lais ou frais excessifs\u2019), Italian (\u2018senza ritardi o spese eccessivi\u2019), Portuguese (\u2018sem demora ou custos excessivos\u2019) and Finnish (\u2018aiheetonta viivyvtyst\u00e4 tai aiheettomia kustannuksia\u2019) \u2013 indicate that Member States are merely required to communicate such information without levying excessive fees.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that some language versions of the provision in question \u2013 such as the English (\u2018without excessive delay or expense\u2019) and Swedish (\u2018st\u00f6rre tidsutdr\u00e4kt eller kostnader\u2019) versions \u2013 are, like the Dutch version, ambiguous in so far as the adjective \u2018excessive\u2019 does not explicitly qualify the word \u2018expense\u2019. However, none of the language versions of that provision unequivocally states that communication must take place free of charge.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is therefore clear from the wording of Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 that that provision does not require the Member States to levy fees when the right to access personal data is exercised; nor, however, does it prohibit the levying of such fees, so long as they are not excessive.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the answer to Question 2 is that Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as not precluding the levying of fees in respect of the communication of personal data by a public authority.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 3\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the referring court seeks to ascertain, in essence, the criteria on the basis of which it is possible to ensure that a fee which is levied when the right to access personal data is exercised is not excessive for the purposes of Article\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under that provision, the Member States are to confer upon any person a right of access to personal data relating to him and to information on the recipients or categories of recipients of such data and the logic involved in any automatic processing of such data. In view of the considerations made above in the analysis of Question 2, Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as requiring Member States to ensure that the exercise of that right of access takes place without constraint, without excessive delay, and without excessive expense.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it is for the Member States to determine whether communication of the information referred to in Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 entails the payment of fees and, if so, to set such fees at a level which is not excessive.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, that provision does not list any criteria for assessing whether fees levied by a Member State when the right of access provided for thereunder is exercised are to be regarded as excessive. In order to establish such criteria, Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 must be construed with regard to its purpose when examined in the light of the objectives of that directive.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it is for any Member State which requires payment of a fee from individuals exercising the right to access the data referred to in Article\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46 to fix that fee at a level which constitutes a fair balance between, on the one hand, the interest of the data subject in protecting his privacy, in particular through his right to have the data communicated to him in an intelligible form, so that he is able, if necessary, to exercise his rights to rectification, erasure and blocking of the data (in the event that the processing of the data does not comply with the directive) and his rights to object and to bring legal proceedings and, on the other, the burden which the obligation to communicate such data represents for the controller (see, by analogy, \nRijkeboer\n, paragraph 64).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the importance \u2013 highlighted in recitals 2 and 10 in the preamble to Directive 95/46 \u2013 of protecting privacy, emphasised in the case-law of the Court (see \nRijkeboer\n, paragraph 47 and the case-law cited) and enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter, the fees which may be levied under Article\u00a012(a) of the directive may not be fixed at a level likely to constitute an obstacle to the exercise of the right of access guaranteed by that provision.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be held that, for the purposes of applying Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46, where a national public authority levies a fee on an individual exercising the right to access personal data relating to him, the level of that fee should not exceed the cost of communicating such data. That upper limit does not prevent the Member States from fixing such fees at a lower level in order to ensure that all individuals retain an effective right to access such data.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the answer to Question 3 is that Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, in order to ensure that fees levied when the right to access personal data is exercised are not excessive for the purposes of that provision, the level of those fees must not exceed the cost of communicating such data. It is for the national court to carry out any verifications necessary, having regard to the circumstances of the case.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 1\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Question 1 must be understood to arise solely in the event that Article\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46 is interpreted as precluding the levying of fees in respect of the communication of personal data by a public authority. As it is, in view of the answer to Question 2, there is no need to answer Question 1.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Eighth Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle 12(a) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as not precluding the levying of fees in respect of the communication of personal data by a public authority.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle 12(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, in order to ensure that fees levied when the right to access personal data is exercised are not excessive for the purposes of that provision, the level of those fees must not exceed the cost of communicating such data. It is for the national court to carry out any verifications necessary, having regard to the circumstances of the case."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 13 May 2014, C-131/12 (\nGoogle Spain and Google\n)\nGeneral data

freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data, and of removing obstacles to the free flow of such data, states in recitals 2, 10, 18 to 20 and 25 in its preamble:\n\u2018(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 data-processing systems are designed to serve man; \u2026 they must, whatever the nationality or residence of natural persons, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, and contribute to \u2026 the well-being of individuals;\n...\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 the object of the national laws on the processing of personal data is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, which is recognised both in Article\u00a08 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms [, signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950,] and in the general principles of Community law; \u2026 for that reason, the approximation of those laws must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community;\n...\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 in order to ensure that individuals are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this Directive, any processing of personal data in the Community must be carried out in accordance with the law of one of the Member States; \u2026 in this connection, processing carried out under the responsibility of a controller who is established in a Member State should be governed by the law of that State; \n(19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 establishment on the territory of a Member State implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements; \u2026 the legal form of such an establishment, whether simply [a] branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in this respect; \u2026 when a single controller is established on the territory of several Member States, particularly by means of subsidiaries, he must ensure, in order to avoid any circumvention of national rules, that each of the establishments fulfils the obligations imposed by the national law applicable to its activities;\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 the fact that the processing of data is carried out by a person established in a third country must not stand in the way of the protection of individuals provided for in this Directive; \u2026 in these cases, the processing should be governed by the law of the Member State in which the means used are located, and there should be guarantees to ensure that the rights and obligations provided for in this Directive are respected in practice;\n...\n(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 the principles of protection must be reflected, on the one hand, in the obligations imposed on persons \u2026 responsible for processing, in particular regarding data quality, technical security, notification to the supervisory authority, and the circumstances under which processing can be carried out, and, on the other hand, in the right conferred on individuals, the data on whom are the subject of processing, to be informed that processing is taking place, to consult the data, to request corrections and even to object to processing in certain circumstances\u2019.\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a02 of Directive 95/46 states that \u2018[f]or the purposes of this Directive:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cpersonal data\u201d shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;\n(b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cprocessing of personal data\u201d (\u201cprocessing\u201d) shall mean any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction;\n...\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201ccontroller\u201d shall mean the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of processing are determined by national or Community laws or regulations, the controller or the specific criteria for his nomination may be designated by national or Community law;\n...\u2019\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03 of Directive 95/46, entitled \u2018Scope\u2019, states in paragraph\u00a01:\n\u2018This Directive shall apply to the

part of a filing system.\u2019\n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04 of Directive 95/46, entitled \u2018National law applicable\u2019, provides:

controller is established on the territory of several Member States, he must take the necessary measures to ensure that each of these establishments complies with the obligations laid down by the national law applicable;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the controller is not established on the Member State\u2019s territory, but in a place where its national law applies by virtue of international public law;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the controller is not established on Community territory and, for purposes of processing personal

Community.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the circumstances referred to in paragraph\u00a01(c), the controller must designate a representative established in the territory of that Member

relating to data quality\u2019) of Chapter II of Directive 95/46, Article\u00a06 is worded as follows:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall provide that personal data must

The complaint was based on the fact that, when an internet user entered Mr\u00a0Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s name in the search engine of the Google group (\u2018Google Search\u2019), he would obtain links to two pages of La Vanguardia\u2019s newspaper, of 19 January and 9\u00a0March 1998 respectively, on which an announcement mentioning Mr\u00a0Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s name appeared for a real-estate auction connected with attachment proceedings for the recovery of social security debts.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By that complaint, Mr\u00a0Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez requested, first, that La Vanguardia be required either to remove or alter those pages so that the personal data relating to him no longer appeared or to use certain tools made available by search engines in order to protect the data. Second, he requested that Google Spain or Google Inc. be required to remove or conceal the personal data relating to him so that they ceased to be included in the search results and no longer appeared in the links to La Vanguardia. Mr\u00a0Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez stated in this context that the attachment proceedings concerning him had been fully resolved for a number of years and that reference to them was now entirely irrelevant.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 30\u00a0July 2010, the AEPD rejected the complaint in so far as it related to La Vanguardia, taking the view that the publication by it of the information in question was legally justified as it took place upon order of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and was intended to give maximum publicity to the auction in order to secure as many bidders as possible.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the complaint was upheld in so far as it was directed against Google Spain and Google Inc. The AEPD considered in this regard that operators of search engines are subject to data protection legislation given that they carry out data processing for which they are responsible and act as intermediaries in the information society. The AEPD took the view that it has the power to require the withdrawal of data and the prohibition of access to certain data by the operators of search engines when it considers that the locating and dissemination of the data are liable to compromise the fundamental right to data protection and the dignity of persons in the broad sense, and this would also encompass the mere wish of the person concerned that such data not be known to third parties. The AEPD considered that that obligation may be owed directly by operators of search engines, without it being necessary to erase the data or information from the website where they appear, including when retention of the information on that site is justified by a statutory provision.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google Spain and Google Inc. brought separate actions against that decision before the Audiencia Nacional (National High Court). The Audiencia Nacional joined the actions.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court states in the order for reference that the actions raise the question of what obligations are owed by operators of search engines to protect personal data of persons concerned who do not wish that certain information, which is published on third parties\u2019 websites and contains personal data relating to them that enable that information to be linked to them, be located, indexed and made available to internet users indefinitely. The answer to that question depends on the way in which Directive 95/46 must be interpreted in the context of these technologies, which appeared after the directive\u2019s publication.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Audiencia Nacional decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the territorial application of Directive [95/46] and, consequently, of the Spanish data protection legislation:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0must it be considered that an \u201cestablishment\u201d, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, exists when any one or more of the following circumstances arise:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0when the undertaking providing the search engine sets up in a Member State an office or subsidiary for the purpose of promoting and selling advertising space on the search engine, which orientates its activity towards the inhabitants of that State,\nor\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0when the parent company designates a subsidiary located in that Member State as its representative and controller for two specific filing systems which relate to the data of customers who have contracted for advertising with that undertaking,\nor\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0when the office or subsidiary established in a Member State forwards to the parent company, located outside the European Union, requests and requirements addressed to it both by data subjects and by the authorities with responsibility for ensuring observation of the right to data protection, even where such collaboration is engaged in voluntarily?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article\u00a04(1)(c) of Directive 95/46 be interpreted as meaning that there is \u201cuse of equipment \u2026 situated on the territory of the said Member State\u201d:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0when a search engine uses crawlers or robots to locate and index information contained in web pages located on servers in that Member State,\nor\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0when it uses a domain name pertaining to a Member State and arranges for searches and the results thereof to be based on the language of that Member State?\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible to regard as a use of equipment, in the terms of Article\u00a04(1)(c) of Directive 95/46, the temporary storage of the information indexed by internet search engines? If the answer to that question is affirmative, can it be considered that that connecting factor is present when the undertaking refuses to disclose the place where it stores those indexes, invoking reasons of competition?\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regardless of the answers to the foregoing questions and particularly in the event that the Court \u2026 considers that the connecting factors referred to in Article\u00a04 of [Directive 95/46] are not present:\nmust Directive 95/46 \u2026 be applied, in the light of Article\u00a08 of the [Charter], in the Member State where the centre of gravity of the conflict is located and more effective protection of the rights of \u2026 Union citizens is possible?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the activity of search engines as providers of content in relation to Directive 95/46 \u2026:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in relation to the activity of [Google Search], as a provider of content, consisting in locating information published or included on the net by third parties, indexing it automatically, storing it temporarily and finally making it available to internet users according to a particular order of preference, when that information contains personal data of third parties: must an activity like the one described be interpreted as falling within the concept of \u201cprocessing of \u2026 data\u201d used in Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the answer to the foregoing question is affirmative, and once again in relation to an activity like the one described:\nmust Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 be interpreted as meaning that the undertaking managing [Google Search] is to be regarded as the \u201ccontroller\u201d of the personal data contained in the web pages that it indexes?\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that the answer to the foregoing question is affirmative:\nmay the [AEPD], protecting the rights embodied in [Article] 12(b) and [subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014] of Directive 95/46, directly impose on [Google Search] a requirement that it withdraw from its indexes an item of information published by third parties, without addressing itself in advance or simultaneously to the owner of the web page on which that information is located?\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that the answer to the foregoing question is affirmative:\nwould the obligation of search engines to protect those rights be excluded when the information that contains the personal data has been lawfully published by third parties and is kept on the web page from which it originates?\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the scope of the right of erasure and/or the right to object, in relation to the \u201cderecho al olvido\u201d (the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), the following question is asked:\nmust it be considered that the rights to erasure and blocking of data, provided for in Article\u00a012(b), and the right to object, provided for by [subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014] of Directive 95/46, extend to enabling the data subject to address himself to search engines in order to prevent indexing of the information relating to him personally, published on third parties\u2019 web pages, invoking his wish that such information should not be known to internet users when he considers that it might be prejudicial to him or he wishes it to be consigned to oblivion, even though the information in question has been lawfully published by third parties?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nQuestion 2(a) and (b), concerning the material scope of Directive 95/46\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 2(a) and (b), which it is appropriate to examine first, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that the activity of a search engine as a provider of content which consists in finding information published or placed on the internet by third parties, indexing it automatically, storing it temporarily and, finally, making it available to internet users according to a particular order of preference must be classified as \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of that provision when that information contains personal data. If the answer is in the affirmative, the referring court seeks to ascertain furthermore whether Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that the operator of a search engine must be regarded as the \u2018controller\u2019 in respect of that processing of the personal data, within the meaning of that provision.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Google Spain and Google Inc., the activity of search engines cannot be regarded as processing of the data which appear on third parties\u2019 web pages displayed in the list of search results, given that search engines process all the information available on the internet without effecting a selection between personal data and other information. Furthermore, even if that activity must be classified as \u2018data processing\u2019, the operator of a search engine cannot be regarded as a \u2018controller\u2019 in respect of that processing since it has no knowledge of those data and does not exercise control over the data.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, Mr\u00a0Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez, the Spanish, Italian, Austrian and Polish Governments and the European Commission consider that that activity quite clearly involves \u2018data processing\u2019 within the meaning of Directive 95/46, which is distinct from the data processing by the publishers of websites and pursues different objectives from such processing. The operator of a search engine is the \u2018controller\u2019 in respect of the data processing carried out by it since it is the operator that determines the purposes and means of that processing.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Greek Government\u2019s submission, the activity in question constitutes such \u2018processing\u2019, but inasmuch as search engines serve merely as intermediaries, the undertakings which operate them cannot be regarded as \u2018controllers\u2019, except where they store data in an \u2018intermediate memory\u2019 or \u2018cache memory\u2019 for a period which exceeds that which is technically necessary.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 defines \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 as \u2018any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction\u2019.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards in particular the internet, the Court has already had occasion to state that the operation of loading personal data on an internet page must be considered to be such \u2018processing\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 (see Case C-101/01 \nLindqvist \nEU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a025).\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns the activity at issue in the main proceedings, it is not contested that the data found, indexed and stored by search engines and made available to their users include information relating to identified or identifiable natural persons and thus \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of that directive.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it must be found that, in exploring the internet automatically, constantly and systematically in search of the information which is published there, the operator of a search engine \u2018collects\u2019 such data which it subsequently \u2018retrieves\u2019, \u2018records\u2019 and \u2018organises\u2019 within the framework of its indexing programmes, \u2018stores\u2019 on its servers and, as the case may be, \u2018discloses\u2019 and \u2018makes available\u2019 to its users in the form of lists of search results. As those operations are referred to expressly and unconditionally in Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46, they must be classified as \u2018processing\u2019 within the meaning of that provision, regardless of the fact that the operator of the search engine also carries out the same operations in respect of other types of information and does not distinguish between the latter and the personal data.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is the foregoing finding affected by the fact that those data have already been published on the internet and are not altered by the search engine.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already held that the operations referred to in Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 must also be classified as such processing where they exclusively concern material that has already been published in unaltered form in the media. It has indeed observed in that regard that a general derogation from the application of Directive 95/46 in such a case would largely deprive the directive of its effect (see, to this effect, Case C-73/07 \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n EU:C:2008:727, paragraphs\u00a048 and 49).\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it follows from the definition contained in Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 that, whilst the alteration of personal data indeed constitutes processing within the meaning of the directive, the other operations which are mentioned there do not, on the other hand, in any way require that the personal data be altered. \n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the question whether the operator of a search engine must be regarded as the \u2018controller\u2019 in respect of the processing of personal data that is carried out by that engine in the context of an activity such as that at issue in the main proceedings, it should be recalled that Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 defines \u2018controller\u2019 as \u2018the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data\u2019. \n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is the search engine operator which determines the purposes and means of that activity and thus of the processing of personal data that it itself carries out within the framework of that activity and which must, consequently, be regarded as the \u2018controller\u2019 in respect of that processing pursuant to Article\u00a02(d).\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it would be contrary not only to the clear wording of that provision but also to its objective \u2014 which is to ensure, through a broad definition of the concept of \u2018controller\u2019, effective and complete protection of data subjects \u2014 to exclude the operator of a search engine from that definition on the ground that it does not exercise control over the personal data published on the web pages of third parties.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this connection, it should be pointed out that the processing of personal data carried out in the context of the activity of a search engine can be distinguished from and is additional to that carried out by publishers of websites, consisting in loading those data on an internet page.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it is undisputed that that activity of search engines plays a decisive role in the overall dissemination of those data in that it renders the latter accessible to any internet user making a search on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name, including to internet users who otherwise would not have found the web page on which those data are published.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also, the organisation and aggregation of information published on the internet that are effected by search engines with the aim of facilitating their users\u2019 access to that information may, when users carry out their search on the basis of an individual\u2019s name, result in them obtaining through the list of results a structured overview of the information relating to that individual that can be found on the internet enabling them to establish a more or less detailed profile of the data subject.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inasmuch as the activity of a search engine is therefore liable to affect significantly, and additionally compared with that of the publishers of websites, the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data, the operator of the search engine as the person determining the purposes and means of that activity must ensure, within the framework of its responsibilities, powers and capabilities, that the activity meets the requirements of Directive 95/46 in order that the guarantees laid down by the directive may have full effect and that effective and complete protection of data subjects, in particular of their right to privacy, may actually be achieved.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the fact that publishers of websites have the option of indicating to operators of search engines, by means in particular of exclusion protocols such as \u2018robot.txt\u2019 or codes such as \u2018noindex\u2019 or \u2018noarchive\u2019, that they wish specific information published on their site to be wholly or partially excluded from the search engines\u2019 automatic indexes does not mean that, if publishers of websites do not so indicate, the operator of a search engine is released from its responsibility for the processing of personal data that it carries out in the context of the engine\u2019s activity.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That fact does not alter the position that the purposes and means of that processing are determined by the operator of the search engine. Furthermore, even if that option for publishers of websites were to mean that they determine the means of that processing jointly with that operator, this finding would not remove any of the latter\u2019s responsibility as Article\u00a02(d) of Directive 95/46 expressly provides that that determination may be made \u2018alone or jointly with others\u2019. \n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the answer to Question 2(a) and (b) is that Article\u00a02(b) and (d) of Directive 95/46 are to be interpreted as meaning that, first, the activity of a search engine consisting in finding information published or placed on the internet by third parties, indexing it automatically, storing it temporarily and, finally, making it available to internet users according to a particular order of preference must be classified as \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) when that information contains personal data and, second, the operator of the search engine must be regarded as the \u2018controller\u2019 in respect of that processing, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d).\n\u00a0\nQuestion 1(a) to (d), concerning the territorial scope of Directive 95/46\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 1(a) to (d), the referring court seeks to establish whether it is possible to apply the national legislation transposing Directive 95/46 in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings. \n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, the referring court has established the following facts:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google Search is offered worldwide through the website \u2018www.google.com\u2019. In numerous States, a local version adapted to the national language exists. The version of Google Search in Spanish is offered through the website \u2018www.google.es\u2019, which has been registered since 16\u00a0September 2003. Google Search is one of the most used search engines in Spain.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google Search is operated by Google Inc., which is the parent company of the Google Group and has its seat in the United States.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google Search indexes websites throughout the world, including websites located in Spain. The information indexed by its \u2018web crawlers\u2019 or robots, that is to say, computer programmes used to locate and sweep up the content of web pages methodically and automatically, is stored temporarily on servers whose State of location is unknown, that being kept secret for reasons of competition.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google Search does not merely give access to content hosted on the indexed websites, but takes advantage of that activity and includes, in return for payment, advertising associated with the internet users\u2019 search terms, for undertakings which wish to use that tool in order to offer their goods or services to the internet users.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Google group has recourse to its subsidiary Google Spain for promoting the sale of advertising space generated on the website \u2018www.google.com\u2019. Google Spain, which was established on 3\u00a0September 2003 and possesses separate legal personality, has its seat in Madrid (Spain). Its activities are targeted essentially at undertakings based in Spain, acting as a commercial agent for the Google group in that Member State. Its objects are to promote, facilitate and effect the sale of on-line advertising products and services to third parties and the marketing of that advertising.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google Inc. designated Google Spain as the controller, in Spain, in respect of two filing systems registered by Google Inc. with the AEPD; those filing systems were intended to contain the personal data of the customers who had concluded contracts for advertising services with Google Inc.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specifically, the main issues raised by the referring court concern the notion of \u2018establishment\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, and of \u2018use of equipment situated on the territory of the said Member State\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1)(c).\n\u00a0Question 1(a)\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 1(a), the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that processing of personal data is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of a Member State, within the meaning of that provision, when one or more of the following three conditions are met: \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the operator of a search engine sets up in a Member State a branch or subsidiary which is intended to promote and sell advertising space offered by that engine and which orientates its activity towards the inhabitants of that Member State, or\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the parent company designates a subsidiary located in that Member State as its representative and controller for two specific filing systems which relate to the data of customers who have contracted for advertising with that undertaking, or\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the branch or subsidiary established in a Member State forwards to the parent company, located outside the European Union, requests and requirements addressed to it both by data subjects and by the authorities with responsibility for ensuring observation of the right to protection of personal data, even where such collaboration is engaged in voluntarily.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns the first of those three conditions, the referring court states that Google Search is operated and managed by Google Inc. and that it has not been established that Google Spain carries out in Spain an activity directly linked to the indexing or storage of information or data contained on third parties\u2019 websites. Nevertheless, according to the referring court, the promotion and sale of advertising space, which Google Spain attends to in respect of Spain, constitutes the bulk of the Google group\u2019s commercial activity and may be regarded as closely linked to Google Search.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez, the Spanish, Italian, Austrian and Polish Governments and the Commission submit that, in the light of the inextricable link between the activity of the search engine operated by Google Inc. and the activity of Google Spain, the latter must be regarded as an establishment of the former and the processing of personal data is carried out in context of the activities of that establishment. On the other hand, according to Google Spain, Google Inc. and the Greek Government, Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 is not applicable in the case of the first of the three conditions listed by the referring court. \n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, it is to be noted first of all that recital 19 in the preamble to Directive 95/46 states that \u2018establishment on the territory of a Member State implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements\u2019 and that \u2018the legal form of such an establishment, whether simply [a] branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor\u2019.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not disputed that Google Spain engages in the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements in Spain. As it moreover has separate legal personality, it constitutes a subsidiary of Google Inc. on Spanish territory and,\u00a0therefore, an \u2018establishment\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive\u00a095/46.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to satisfy the criterion laid down in that provision, it is also necessary that the processing of personal data by the controller be \u2018carried out in the context of the activities\u2019 of an establishment of the controller on the territory of a Member State.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google Spain and Google Inc. dispute that this is the case since the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings is carried out exclusively by Google Inc., which operates Google Search without any intervention on the part of Google Spain; the latter\u2019s activity is limited to providing support to the Google group\u2019s advertising activity which is separate from its search engine service.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, as the Spanish Government and the Commission in particular have pointed out, Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 does not require the processing of personal data in question to be carried out \u2018by\u2019 the establishment concerned itself, but only that it be carried out \u2018in the context of the activities\u2019 of the establishment.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in the light of the objective of Directive 95/46 of ensuring effective and complete protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data, those words cannot be interpreted restrictively (see, by analogy, Case C-324/09 \nL'Or\u00e9al and Others\n EU:C:2011:474, paragraphs\u00a062 and 63).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is to be noted in this context that it is clear in particular from recitals 18 to 20 in the preamble to Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04 thereof that the European Union legislature sought to prevent individuals from being deprived of the protection guaranteed by the directive and that protection from being circumvented, by prescribing a particularly broad territorial scope.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of that objective of Directive 95/46 and of the wording of Article\u00a04(1)(a), it must be held that the processing of personal data for the purposes of the service of a search engine such as Google Search, which is operated by an undertaking that has its seat in a third State but has an establishment in a Member State, is carried out \u2018in the context of the activities\u2019 of that establishment if the latter is intended to promote and sell, in that Member State, advertising space offered by the search engine which serves to make the service offered by that engine profitable.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In such circumstances, the activities of the operator of the search engine and those of its establishment situated in the Member State concerned are inextricably linked since the activities relating to the advertising space constitute the means of rendering the search engine at issue economically profitable and that engine is, at the same time, the means enabling those activities to be performed.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As has been stated in paragraphs\u00a026 to 28 of the present judgment, the very display of personal data on a search results page constitutes processing of such data. Since that display of results is accompanied, on the same page, by the display of advertising linked to the search terms, it is clear that the processing of personal data in question is carried out in the context of the commercial and advertising activity of the controller\u2019s establishment on the territory of a Member State, in this instance Spanish territory.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, it cannot be accepted that the processing of personal data carried out for the purposes of the operation of the search engine should escape the obligations and guarantees laid down by Directive 95/46, which would compromise the directive\u2019s effectiveness and the effective and complete protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons which the directive seeks to ensure (see, by analogy, \nL'Or\u00e9al and Others\n EU:C:2011:474, paragraphs\u00a062 and 63), in particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data, a right to which the directive accords special importance as is confirmed in particular by Article\u00a01(1) thereof and recitals 2 and 10 in its preamble (see, to this effect, Joined Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 \n \u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n EU:C:2003:294, paragraph\u00a070; Case C-553/07 \nRijkeboer \nEU:C:2009:293, paragraph\u00a047; and Case C-473/12\u00a0\nIPI \nEU:C:2013:715, paragraph\u00a028 and the case-law cited).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the first of the three conditions listed by the referring court suffices by itself for it to be concluded that an establishment such as Google Spain satisfies the criterion laid down in Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, it is unnecessary to examine the other two conditions.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that the answer to Question 1(a) is that Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that processing of personal data is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of a Member State, within the meaning of that provision, when the operator of a search engine sets up in a Member State a branch or subsidiary which is intended to promote and sell advertising space offered by that engine and which orientates its activity towards the inhabitants of that Member State.\n\u00a0Question 1(b) to (d)\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the answer given to Question 1(a), there is no need to answer Question\u00a01(b) to (d).\n\u00a0\nQuestion 2(c) and (d), concerning the extent of the responsibility of the operator of a search engine under Directive 95/46 \n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 2(c) and (d), the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 are to be interpreted as meaning that, in order to comply with the rights laid down in those provisions, the operator of a search engine is obliged to remove from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a person\u2019s name links to web pages, published by third parties and containing information relating to that person, also in a case where that name or information is not erased beforehand or simultaneously from those web pages, and even, as the case may be, when its publication in itself on those pages is lawful.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google Spain and Google Inc. submit that, by virtue of the principle of proportionality, any request seeking the removal of information must be addressed to the publisher of the website concerned because it is he who takes the responsibility for making the information public, who is in a position to appraise the lawfulness of that publication and who has available to him the most effective and least restrictive means of making the information inaccessible. Furthermore, to require the operator of a search engine to withdraw information published on the internet from its indexes would take insufficient account of the fundamental rights of publishers of websites, of other internet users and of that operator itself.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Austrian Government, a national supervisory authority may order such an operator to erase information published by third parties from its filing systems only if the data in question have been found previously to be unlawful or incorrect or if the data subject has made a successful objection to the publisher of the website on which that information was published.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez, the Spanish, Italian and Polish Governments and the Commission submit that the national authority may directly order the operator of a search engine to withdraw from its indexes and intermediate memory information containing personal data that has been published by third parties, without having to approach beforehand or simultaneously the publisher of the web page on which that information appears. Furthermore, according to Mr\u00a0Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez, the Spanish and Italian Governments and the Commission, the fact that the information has been published lawfully and that it still appears on the original web page has no effect on the obligations of that operator under Directive 95/46. On the other hand, according to the Polish Government that fact is such as to release the operator from its obligations.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, it should be remembered that, as is apparent from Article\u00a01 and recital\u00a010 in the preamble, Directive 95/46 seeks to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data (see, to this effect, \nIPI \nEU:C:2013:715, paragraph\u00a028).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to recital 25 in the preamble to Directive 95/46, the principles of protection laid down by the directive are reflected, on the one hand, in the obligations imposed on persons responsible for processing, in particular regarding data quality, technical security, notification to the supervisory authority and the circumstances under which processing can be carried out, and, on the other hand, in the rights conferred on individuals whose data are the subject of processing to be informed that processing is taking place, to consult the data, to request corrections and even to object to processing in certain circumstances.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already held that the provisions of Directive 95/46, in so far as they govern the processing of personal data liable to infringe fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to privacy, must necessarily be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights, which, according to settled case-law, form an integral part of the general principles of law whose observance the Court ensures and which are now set out in the Charter (see, in particular, Case C-274/99\u00a0P \nConnolly\n v \nCommission \nEU:C:2001:127, paragraph\u00a037, and\n \u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n EU:C:2003:294, paragraph\u00a068).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a07 of the Charter guarantees the right to respect for private life, whilst Article\u00a08 of the Charter expressly proclaims the right to the protection of personal data. Article\u00a08(2) and (3) specify that such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law, that everyone has the right of access to data which have been collected concerning him or her and the right to have the data rectified, and that compliance with these rules is to be subject to control by an independent authority. Those requirements are implemented inter alia by Articles\u00a06, 7, 12, 14 and 28 of Directive 95/46.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a012(b) of Directive 95/46 provides that Member States are to guarantee every data subject the right to obtain from the controller, as appropriate, the rectification, erasure or blocking of data the processing of which does not comply with the provisions of Directive 95/46, in particular because of the incomplete or inaccurate nature of the data. As this final point relating to the case where certain requirements referred to in Article\u00a06(1)(d) of Directive 95/46 are not observed is stated by way of example and is not exhaustive, it follows that non-compliant nature of the processing, which is capable of conferring upon the data subject the right guaranteed in Article\u00a012(b) of the directive, may also arise from non-observance of the other conditions of lawfulness that are imposed by the directive upon the processing of personal data. \n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this connection, it should be noted that, subject to the exceptions permitted under Article\u00a013 of Directive 95/46, all processing of personal data must comply, first, with the principles relating to data quality set out in Article\u00a06 of the directive and, secondly, with one of the criteria for making data processing legitimate listed in Article\u00a07 of the directive (see \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n EU:C:2003:294, paragraph\u00a065; Joined Cases C-468/10 and C-469/10 \nASNEF and FECEMD\n EU:C:2011:777, paragraph\u00a026; and Case C-342/12 \nWorten \nEU:C:2013:355, paragraph\u00a033).\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a06 of Directive 95/46 and without prejudice to specific provisions that the Member States may lay down in respect of processing for historical, statistical or scientific purposes, the controller has the task of ensuring that personal data are processed \u2018fairly and lawfully\u2019, that they are \u2018collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes\u2019, that they are \u2018adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed\u2019, that they are \u2018accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date\u2019 and, finally, that they are \u2018kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed\u2019. In this context, the controller must take every reasonable step to ensure that data which do not meet the requirements of that provision are erased or rectified.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards legitimation, under Article\u00a07 of Directive 95/46, of processing such as that at issue in the main proceedings carried out by the operator of a search engine, that processing is capable of being covered by the ground in Article\u00a07(f).\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This provision permits the processing of personal data where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject\u00a0\u2014 in particular his right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data\u00a0\u2014 which require protection under Article\u00a01(1) of the directive. Application of Article\u00a07(f) thus necessitates a balancing of the opposing rights and interests concerned, in the context of which account must be taken of the significance of the data subject\u2019s rights arising from Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter (see \nASNEF and FECEMD\n, EU:C:2011:777, paragraphs\u00a038 and 40).\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whilst the question whether the processing complies with Articles\u00a06 and 7(f) of Directive 95/46 may be determined in the context of a request as provided for in Article\u00a012(b) of the directive, the data subject may, in addition, rely in certain conditions on the right to object laid down in subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of the directive.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46, Member States are to grant the data subject the right, at least in the cases referred to in Article\u00a07(e) and (f) of the directive, to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation to the processing of data relating to him, save where otherwise provided by national legislation. The balancing to be carried out under subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 thus enables account to be taken in a more specific manner of all the circumstances surrounding the data subject\u2019s particular situation. Where there is a justified objection, the processing instigated by the controller may no longer involve those data.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Requests under Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 may be addressed by the data subject directly to the controller who must then duly examine their merits and, as the case may be, end processing of the data in question. Where the controller does not grant the request, the data subject may bring the matter before the supervisory authority or the judicial authority so that it carries out the necessary checks and orders the controller to take specific measures accordingly.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this connection, it is to be noted that it is clear from Article\u00a028(3) and (4) of Directive 95/46 that each supervisory authority is to hear claims lodged by any person concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal data and that it has investigative powers and effective powers of intervention enabling it to order in particular the blocking, erasure or destruction of data or to impose a temporary or definitive ban on such processing.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is in the light of those considerations that it is necessary to interpret and apply the provisions of Directive 95/46 governing the data subject\u2019s rights when he lodges with the supervisory authority or judicial authority a request such as that at issue in the main proceedings.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be pointed out at the outset that, as has been found in paragraphs\u00a036 to 38 of the present judgment, processing of personal data, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, carried out by the operator of a search engine is liable to affect significantly the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data when the search by means of that engine is carried out on the basis of an individual\u2019s name, since that processing enables any internet user to obtain through the list of results a structured overview of the information relating to that individual that can be found on the internet\u00a0\u2014 information which potentially concerns a vast number of aspects of his private life and which, without the search engine, could not have been interconnected or could have been only with great difficulty\u00a0\u2014 and thereby to establish a more or less detailed profile of him. Furthermore, the effect of the interference with those rights of the data subject is heightened on account of the important role played by the internet and search engines in modern society, which render the information contained in such a list of results ubiquitous (see, to this effect, Joined Cases C-509/09 and C-161/10 \neDate Advertising and Others\n EU:C:2011:685, paragraph\u00a045).\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the potential seriousness of that interference, it is clear that it cannot be justified by merely the economic interest which the operator of such an engine has in that processing. However, inasmuch as the removal of links from the list of results could, depending on the information at issue, have effects upon the legitimate interest of internet users potentially interested in having access to that information, in situations such as that at issue in the main proceedings a fair balance should be sought in particular between that interest and the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights under Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter. Whilst it is true that the data subject\u2019s rights protected by those articles also override, as a general rule, that interest of internet users, that balance may however depend, in specific cases, on the nature of the information in question and its sensitivity for the data subject\u2019s private life and on the interest of the public in having that information, an interest which may vary, in particular, according to the role played by the data subject in public life.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the appraisal of the conditions for the application of Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 which is to be carried out when a request such as that at issue in the main proceedings is lodged with it, the supervisory authority or judicial authority may order the operator of the search engine to remove from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a person\u2019s name links to web pages published by third parties containing information relating to that person, without an order to that effect presupposing the previous or simultaneous removal of that name and information \u2014 of the publisher\u2019s own accord or following an order of one of those authorities \u2014 from the web page on which they were published.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As has been established in paragraphs\u00a035 to 38 of the present judgment, inasmuch as the data processing carried out in the context of the activity of a search engine can be distinguished from and is additional to that carried out by publishers of websites and affects the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights additionally, the operator of the search engine as the controller in respect of that processing must ensure, within the framework of its responsibilities, powers and capabilities, that that processing meets the requirements of Directive 95/46, in order that the guarantees laid down by the directive may have full effect.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the ease with which information published on a website can be replicated on other sites and the fact that the persons responsible for its publication are not always subject to European Union legislation, effective and complete protection of data users could not be achieved if the latter had to obtain first or in parallel the erasure of the information relating to them from the publishers of websites.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the processing by the publisher of a web page consisting in the publication of information relating to an individual may, in some circumstances, be carried out \u2018solely for journalistic purposes\u2019 and thus benefit, by virtue of Article\u00a09 of Directive 95/46, from derogations from the requirements laid down by the directive, whereas that does not appear to be so in the case of the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine. It cannot therefore be ruled out that in certain circumstances the data subject is capable of exercising the rights referred to in Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 against that operator but not against the publisher of the web page. \n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, it must be stated that not only does the ground, under Article\u00a07 of Directive 95/46, justifying the publication of a piece of personal data on a website not necessarily coincide with that which is applicable to the activity of search engines, but also, even where that is the case, the outcome of the weighing of the interests at issue to be carried out under Article\u00a07(f) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of the directive may differ according to whether the processing carried out by the operator of a search engine or that carried out by the publisher of the web page is at issue, given that, first, the legitimate interests justifying the processing may be different and, second, the consequences of the processing for the data subject, and in particular for his private life, are not necessarily the same.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, since the inclusion in the list of results, displayed following a search made on the basis of a person\u2019s name, of a web page and of the information contained on it relating to that person makes access to that information appreciably easier for any internet user making a search in respect of the person concerned and may play a decisive role in the dissemination of that information, it is liable to constitute a more significant interference with the data subject\u2019s fundamental right to privacy than the publication on the web page.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to Question 2(c) and (d) is that Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 are to be interpreted as meaning that, in order to comply with the rights laid down in those provisions and in so far as the conditions laid down by those provisions are in fact satisfied, the operator of a search engine is obliged to remove from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a person\u2019s name links to web pages, published by third parties and containing information relating to that person, also in a case where that name or information is not erased beforehand or simultaneously from those web pages, and even, as the case may be, when its publication in itself on those pages is lawful.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 3, concerning the scope of the data subject\u2019s rights guaranteed by Directive 95/46\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 3, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 are to be interpreted as enabling the data subject to require the operator of a search engine to remove from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name links to web pages published lawfully by third parties and containing true information relating to him, on the ground that that information may be prejudicial to him or that he wishes it to be \u2018forgotten\u2019 after a certain time. \n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google Spain, Google Inc., the Greek, Austrian and Polish Governments and the Commission consider that this question should be answered in the negative. Google Spain, Google Inc., the Polish Government and the Commission submit in this regard that Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 confer rights upon data subjects only if the processing in question is incompatible with the directive or on compelling legitimate grounds relating to their particular situation, and not merely because they consider that that processing may be prejudicial to them or they wish that the data being processed sink into oblivion. The Greek and Austrian Governments submit that the data subject must approach the publisher of the website concerned.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Mr Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez and the Spanish and Italian Governments, the data subject may oppose the indexing by a search engine of personal data relating to him where their dissemination through the search engine is prejudicial to him and his fundamental rights to the protection of those data and to privacy \u2014 which encompass the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 \u2014 override the legitimate interests of the operator of the search engine and the general interest in freedom of information.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards Article\u00a012(b) of Directive 95/46, the application of which is subject to the condition that the processing of personal data be incompatible with the directive, it should be recalled that, as has been noted in paragraph\u00a072 of the present judgment, such incompatibility may result not only from the fact that such data are inaccurate but, in particular, also from the fact that they are inadequate, irrelevant or excessive in relation to the purposes of the processing, that they are not kept up to date, or that they are kept for longer than is necessary unless they are required to be kept for historical, statistical or scientific purposes.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from those requirements, laid down in Article\u00a06(1)(c) to (e) of Directive 95/46, that even initially lawful processing of accurate data may, in the course of time, become incompatible with the directive where those data are no longer necessary in the light of the purposes for which they were collected or processed. That is so in particular where they appear to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to those purposes and in the light of the time that has elapsed.\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, if it is found, following a request by the data subject pursuant to Article\u00a012(b) of Directive 95/46, that the inclusion in the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name of the links to web pages published lawfully by third parties and containing true information relating to him personally is, at this point in time, incompatible with Article\u00a06(1)(c) to (e) of the directive because that information appears, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes of the processing at issue carried out by the operator of the search engine, the information and links concerned in the list of results must be erased.\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns requests as provided for by Article\u00a012(b) of Directive 95/46 founded on alleged non-compliance with the conditions laid down in Article\u00a07(f) of the directive and requests under subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of the directive, it must be pointed out that in each case the processing of personal data must be authorised under Article\u00a07 for the entire period during which it is carried out.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, when appraising such requests made in order to oppose processing such as that at issue in the main proceedings, it should in particular be examined whether the data subject has a right that the information relating to him personally should, at this point in time, no longer be linked to his name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name. In this connection, it must be pointed out that it is not necessary in order to find such a right that the inclusion of the information in question in the list of results causes prejudice to the data subject.\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the data subject may, in the light of his fundamental rights under Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, request that the information in question no longer be made available to the general public by its inclusion in such a list of results, it should be held, as follows in particular from paragraph\u00a081 of the present judgment, that those rights override, as a rule, not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in finding that information upon a search relating to the data subject\u2019s name. However, that would not be the case if it appeared, for particular reasons, such as the role played by the data subject in public life, that the interference with his fundamental rights is justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having, on account of inclusion in the list of results, access to the information in question.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which concerns the display, in the list of results that the internet user obtains by making a search by means of Google Search on the basis of the data subject\u2019s name, of links to pages of the on-line archives of a daily newspaper that contain announcements mentioning the data subject\u2019s name and relating to a real-estate auction connected with attachment proceedings for the recovery of social security debts, it should be held that, having regard to the sensitivity for the data subject\u2019s private life of the information contained in those announcements and to the fact that its initial publication had taken place 16 years earlier, the data subject establishes a right that that information should no longer be linked to his name by means of such a list. Accordingly, since in the case in point there do not appear to be particular reasons substantiating a preponderant interest of the public in having, in the context of such a search, access to that information, a matter which is, however, for the referring court to establish, the data subject may, by virtue of Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46, require those links to be removed from the list of results.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing considerations that the answer to Question 3 is that Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 are to be interpreted as meaning that, when appraising the conditions for the application of those provisions, it should inter alia be examined whether the data subject has a right that the information in question relating to him personally should, at this point in time, no longer be linked to his name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name, without it being necessary in order to find such a right that the inclusion of the information in question in that list causes prejudice to the data subject. As the data subject may, in the light of his fundamental rights under Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, request that the information in question no longer be made available to the general public on account of its inclusion in such a list of results, those rights override, as a rule, not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in having access to that information upon a search relating to the data subject\u2019s name. However, that would not be the case if it appeared, for particular reasons, such as the role played by the data subject in public life, that the interference with his fundamental rights is justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having, on account of its inclusion in the list of results, access to the information in question.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(b) and (d) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data are to be interpreted as meaning that, first, the activity of a search engine consisting in finding information published or placed on the internet by third parties, indexing it automatically, storing it temporarily and, finally, making it available to internet users according to a particular order of preference must be classified as \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) when that information contains personal data and, second, the operator of the search engine must be regarded as the \u2018controller\u2019 in respect of that processing, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(d).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that processing of personal data is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of a Member State, within the meaning of that provision, when the operator of a search engine sets up in a Member State a branch or subsidiary which is intended to promote and sell advertising space offered by that engine and which orientates its activity towards the inhabitants of that Member State.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 are to be interpreted as meaning that, in order to comply with the rights laid down in those provisions and in so far as the conditions laid down by those provisions are in fact satisfied, the operator of a search engine is obliged to remove from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a person\u2019s name links to web pages, published by third parties and containing information relating to that person, also in a case where that name or information is not erased beforehand or simultaneously from those web pages, and even, as the case may be, when its publication in itself on those pages is lawful. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 are to be interpreted as meaning that, when appraising the conditions for the application of those provisions, it should inter alia be examined whether the data subject has a right that the information in question relating to him personally should, at this point in time, no longer be linked to his name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name, without it being necessary in order to find such a right that the inclusion of the information in question in that list causes prejudice to the data subject.

The foreign nationals concerned are those who reside in that territory for a period of more than three months, as is shown by the general administrative circular of the Federal Ministry of the Interior relating to the AZRG and to the regulation implementing that Law (Allgemeine Verwaltungsvorschrift des Bundesministeriums des Innern zum Gesetz \u00fcber das AZR und zur AZRG-Durchf\u00fchrungsverordnung) of 4 June 1996.

The Bundesamt must, in particular, examine whether the data requested by an authority are necessary for the performance of its tasks and must also examine the precise use to which those data are intended to be put. The Bundesamt may reject an application if it does not satisfy the prescribed conditions.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraphs 14 to 21 and 25 to 27 of the Law specify the personal data which may be made available depending on the body which made the application in respect of them.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, Paragraph 14(1) of the AZRG authorises the communication to all German public authorities of data relating to identity and domicile, as well as the date of death and particulars of the authority responsible for the file and of any decision not to make data available.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 12 of the AZRG provides that applications, termed \u2018group applications\u2019, that is to say, which relate to a group of persons having one or more common characteristics, are to be subject to certain substantive and formal conditions. Such applications may be made only by a limited number of public bodies. In addition, every communication of personal data pursuant to such an application must be notified to the Federal and regional regulators responsible for the protection of personal data.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Paragraph 22 of the AZRG permits public bodies authorised for that purpose to consult the AZR directly through an automated procedure. However, the right to do so arises only in strictly defined circumstances and after a weighing up by the Bundesamt of the interests of the data subject and the public interest. Moreover, such consultation is allowed only in the case of so-called group applications. The public bodies having rights under Paragraph 22 of the AZRG are, by virtue of Paragraph 7 of that Law, also authorised to enter data and information directly in the AZR.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, Paragraphs 25 to 27 of the AZRG specify the public bodies which may obtain certain data contained in the AZR.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national court adds that, in Germany, every inhabitant, whether a German national or not, must have his particulars entered in the register kept by the authorities of the district in which he resides (Einwohnermelderegister). The Commission has stated in that regard that that type of register contains only some of the data comprised in the AZR, with those relating, in particular, to a person\u2019s status as regards his right of residence not appearing there. There are currently some 7\u00a0700 district registers.\n\u00a0\nThe facts and the questions referred \n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Huber, an Austrian national, moved to Germany in 1996 in order to carry on business there as a self-employed insurance agent. \n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following data relating to him are stored in the AZR:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0his name, given name, date and place of birth, nationality, marital status, sex;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a record of his entries into and exits from Germany, and his residence status;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0particulars of passports issued to him;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a record of his previous statements as to domicile; and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0reference numbers issued by the Bundesamt, particulars of the authorities which supplied the data and the reference numbers used by those authorities.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since he took the view that he was discriminated against by reason of the processing of the data concerning him contained in the AZR, in particular because such a database does not exist in respect of German nationals, Mr Huber requested the deletion of those data on 22 July 2000. That request was rejected on 29\u00a0September 2000 by the administrative authority which was responsible for maintaining the AZR at the time.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The challenge to that decision also having been unsuccessful, Mr Huber brought an action before the Verwaltungsgericht K\u00f6ln (Administrative Court, Cologne) which upheld the action by judgment of 19 December 2002. The Verwaltungsgericht K\u00f6ln held that the general processing, through the AZR, of data regarding a Union citizen who is not a German national constitutes a restriction of Articles 49 EC and 50 EC which cannot be justified by the objective of the swift treatment of cases relating to the right of residence of foreign nationals. In addition, that court took the view that the storage and processing of the data at issue were contrary to Articles 12 EC and 18 EC, as well as Articles\u00a06(1)(b) and 7(e) of Directive 95/46.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bundesrepublik Deutschland, acting through the Bundesamt, brought an appeal against that judgment before the Oberverwaltungsgericht f\u00fcr das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen (Higher Administrative Court for the \nLand \nNorth-Rhine Westphalia), which considers that certain of the questions of law raised before it require an interpretation of Community law by the Court.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the national court notes that, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, a citizen of the European Union lawfully resident in the territory of a Member State of which he is not a national can rely on Article 12 EC in all situations which fall within the scope of Community law. It refers in that regard to Case C-85/96 \nMart\u00ednez Sala \n[1998] ECR I-2691, paragraph 63; Case C-184/99 \nGrzelczyk\n [2001] ECR I-6193, paragraph 32; and Case C-209/03 \nBidar \n[2005] ECR I-2119, paragraph 32. Accordingly, having exercised the right to the freedom of movement conferred on him by Article 18(1) EC, Mr Huber was entitled to rely on the prohibition of discrimination laid down by Article 12 EC.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national court states that the general processing of personal data relating to Mr Huber in the AZR differs from the processing of data relating to a German national in two respects: first, some of the data relating to Mr Huber are stored not only in the register of the district in which he resides but also in the AZR, and, secondly, the AZR contains additional data. \n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national court doubts whether such a difference in treatment can be justified by the need to monitor the residence of foreign nationals in Germany. It also raises the question whether the general processing of personal data relating to Union citizens who are not German nationals and who reside or have resided in Germany is proportionate to the objective of protecting public security, inasmuch as the AZR covers all of those citizens and not only those who are subject to an expulsion order or a prohibition on residing in Germany.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, the national court is of the opinion that, in the circumstances of the main proceedings, Mr Huber falls within the scope of application of Article 43 EC. Since the freedom of establishment extends not only to the taking up of activities as a self-employed person but also the framework conditions for that activity, the national court raises the question whether the general processing of data relating to Mr Huber in the AZR is liable to affect those conditions to such an extent that it comprises a restriction on the exercise of that freedom.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, the national court raises the question whether the criterion of necessity imposed by Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46 can be a criterion for assessing a system of general data processing such as the system put in place under the AZR. The national court does not, in fact, rule out the possibility that the directive may leave it open to the national legislature itself to define that requirement of necessity. However, should that not be the case, the question arises how that requirement is to be understood, and more particularly whether the objective of administrative simplification might justify data processing of the kind put in place by the AZRG.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Oberverwaltungsgericht f\u00fcr das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen decided to stay the proceedings and refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the general processing of personal data of foreign citizens of the Union in a central register of foreign nationals compatible with \u2026 the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality against citizens of the Union who exercise their right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States (Article 12(1) EC, in conjunction with Articles 17 EC and 18(1) EC)[?]\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Is such processing compatible with] the prohibition of restrictions on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in the territory of another Member State (first paragraph of Article 43 EC)[?]\n(3) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Is such treatment compatible with] the requirement of necessity under Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46 \u2026?\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe questions referred\n\u00a0\nPreliminary observations\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its questions, the national court asks the Court whether the processing of personal data which is undertaken in a register such as the AZR is compatible with Community law. \n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be noted that Paragraph 1(2) of the AZRG provides that, through the storage of certain personal data relating to foreign nationals in the AZR and the making available of those data, the Bundesamt, which is responsible for maintaining that register, assists the public authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the law on foreign nationals and the law on asylum, together with other public bodies. In particular, the German Government has stated in its written observations that the AZR is used for statistical purposes and on the exercise by the security and police services and by the judicial authorities of their powers in relation to the prosecution and investigation of activities which are criminal or threaten public security. \n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset, it must be stated that data such as those which, according to the order for reference, the AZR contains in relation to Mr Huber constitute personal data within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Directive 95/46, because they represent \u2018information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019. Their collection, storage and transmission by the body responsible for the management of the register in which they are kept thus represents the \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article 2(b) of that directive.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46 expressly excludes from its scope of application, inter alia, the processing of personal data concerning public security, defence, State security and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, while the processing of personal data for the purposes of the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence and for statistical purposes falls within the scope of application of Directive 95/46, the position is otherwise where the objective of processing those data is connected with the fight against crime.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the compatibility with Community law of the processing of personal data undertaken through a register such as the AZR should be examined, first, in the context of its function of providing support to the authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence and to its use for statistical purposes, by having regard to Directive 95/46 and more particularly, in view of the third question, to the condition of necessity laid down by Article 7(e) of that directive, as interpreted in the light of the requirements of the Treaty including in particular the prohibition of any discrimination on grounds of nationality under Article 12(1) EC, and, secondly, in the context of its function in the fight against crime, by having regard to primary Community law.\n\u00a0\nThe processing of personal data for the purpose of the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence and for statistical purposes \n\u00a0The concept of necessity \n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1 of Directive 95/46 requires Member States to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their privacy, in relation to the handling of personal data.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter II of Directive 95/46, entitled \u2018General rules on the lawfulness of the processing of personal data\u2019, provides that, subject to the exceptions permitted under Article 13, all processing of personal data must comply, first, with the principles relating to data quality set out in Article 6 of the directive and, secondly, with one of the criteria for making data processing legitimate listed in Article 7 (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others \n[2003] ECR I-4989, paragraph 65).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, Article 7(e) provides that personal data may lawfully be processed if \u2018it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party to whom the data are disclosed\u2019.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it must be noted that Directive 95/46 is intended, as appears from the eighth recital in the preamble thereto, to ensure that the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data is equivalent in all Member States. The tenth recital adds that the approximation of the national laws applicable in this area must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it has been held that the harmonisation of those national laws is not limited to minimal harmonisation but amounts to harmonisation which is generally complete (see Case C-101/01 \nLindqvist\n [2003] ECR I-12971, paragraph 96).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, having regard to the objective of ensuring an equivalent level of protection in all Member States, the concept of necessity laid down by Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, the purpose of which is to delimit precisely one of the situations in which the processing of personal data is lawful, cannot have a meaning which varies between the Member States. It therefore follows that what is at issue is a concept which has its own independent meaning in Community law and which must be interpreted in a manner which fully reflects the objective of that directive, as laid down in Article 1(1) thereof.\n\u00a0The necessity for the processing of personal data, such as the processing undertaken through the AZR, for the purpose of the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence and for statistical purposes \n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the order for reference that the AZR is a centralised register which contains certain personal data relating to Union citizens who are not German nationals and that it may be consulted by a number of public and private bodies. \n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the use of a register such as the AZR for the purpose of the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence, it is important to bear in mind that, as Community law presently stands, the right of free movement of a Union citizen in the territory of a Member State of which he is not a national is not unconditional but may be subject to the limitations and conditions imposed by the Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect (see, to that effect, Case C-33/07 \nJippa \n[2008] ECR I-0000, paragraph 21 and the case-law cited).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, Article 4 of Directive 68/360, read in conjunction with Article 1 thereof, and Article 6 of Directive 73/148, read in conjunction with Article 1 thereof, provided that, in order for a national of a Member State to be entitled to reside for a period of more than three months in the territory of another Member State, that person had to belong to one of the categories laid down by those directives and provided for that entitlement to be subject to certain formalities linked to the presentation or the provision by the applicant of a residence permit together with various documents and particulars.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Article 10 of Directive 68/360 and Article 8 of Directive 73/148 permitted Member States to derogate from the provisions of those directives on grounds of public policy, public security or public health and to limit the right of entry and residence of a national of another Member State in their territory.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Directive 2004/38, which fell to be transposed by 30 April 2006 and which accordingly did not apply at the time of the facts of the present case, repealed both of the abovementioned directives, it sets out, in Article 7, conditions which are generally equivalent to those laid down under its predecessors as regards the right of residence of nationals of other Member States and, in Article 27(1), restrictions relating to that right which are essentially identical to those laid down under its predecessors. It also provides, in Article 8(1), that the host Member State may require every Union citizen who is a national of another Member State and who wishes to reside in its territory for a period of more than three months to register with the relevant authorities. In that regard, the host Member State may, by virtue of Article 8(3), require certain documents and particulars to be provided in order to enable those authorities to determine that the conditions for entitlement to a right of residence are satisfied.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must therefore be held that it is necessary for a Member State to have the relevant particulars and documents available to it in order to ascertain, within the framework laid down under the applicable Community legislation, whether a right of residence in its territory exists in relation to a national of another Member State and to establish that there are no grounds which would justify a restriction on that right. It follows that the use of a register such as the AZR for the purpose of providing support to the authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence is, in principle, legitimate and, having regard to its nature, compatible with the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality laid down by Article 12(1) EC.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, such a register must not contain any information other than what is necessary for that purpose. In that regard, as Community law presently stands, the processing of personal data contained in the documents referred to in Articles 8(3) and 27(1) of Directive 2004/38 must be considered to be necessary, within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, while the collection of the data required for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence would be of no practical benefit if those data were not to be stored, it must be emphasised that, since a change in the personal situation of a party entitled to a right of residence may have an impact on his status in relation to that right, it is incumbent on the authority responsible for a register such as the AZR to ensure that the data which are stored are, where appropriate, brought up to date so that, first, they reflect the actual situation of the data subjects and, secondly, irrelevant data are removed from that register.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the detailed rules for the use of such a register for the purposes of the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence, only the grant of access to authorities having powers in that field could be considered to be necessary within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, with respect to the necessity that a centralised register such as the AZR be available in order to meet the requirements of the authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence, even if it were to be assumed that decentralised registers such as the district population registers contain all the data which are relevant for the purposes of allowing the authorities to undertake their duties, the centralisation of those data could be necessary, within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, if it contributes to the more effective application of that legislation as regards the right of residence of Union citizens who wish to reside in a Member State of which they are not nationals. \n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the statistical function of a register such as the AZR, it must be recalled that, by creating the principle of freedom of movement for persons and by conferring on any person falling within its ambit the right of access to the territory of the Member States for the purposes intended by the Treaty, Community law has not excluded the power of Member States to adopt measures enabling the national authorities to have an exact knowledge of population movements affecting their territory (see Case 118/75 \nWatson and Belmann \n[1976] ECR 1185, paragraph 17).\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, Regulation No 862/2007, which provides for the transmission of statistics relating to migratory flows in the territory of the Member States, presupposes that information will be collected by those States which allows those statistics to be determined.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the exercise of that power does not, of itself, mean that the collection and storage of individualised personal information in a register such as the AZR is necessary, within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46. As the Advocate General stated at point 23 of his Opinion, it is only anonymous information that requires to be processed in order for such an objective to be attained.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all of the above that a system for processing personal data relating to Union citizens who are not nationals of the Member State concerned, such as that put in place by the AZRG and having as its object the provision of support to the national authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence, does not satisfy the requirement of necessity laid down by Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, interpreted in the light of the prohibition on any discrimination on grounds of nationality, unless:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0it contains only the data which are necessary for the application by those authorities of that legislation, and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0its centralised nature enables that legislation to be more effectively applied as regards the right of residence of Union citizens who are not nationals of that Member State.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for the national court to ascertain whether those conditions are satisfied in the main proceedings.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The storage and processing of personal data containing individualised personal information in a register such as the AZR for statistical purposes cannot, on any basis, be considered to be necessary within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46.\n\u00a0\nThe processing of personal data relating to Union citizens who are nationals of other Member States for the purposes of fighting crime \n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, according to settled case-law, citizenship of the Union is destined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States, enabling those who find themselves in the same situation to receive the same treatment in law irrespective of their nationality, subject to such exceptions as are expressly provided for (see, to that effect, \nGrzelczyk\n, paragraphs\u00a030 and 31; Case C-148/02 \nGarcia Avello \n[2003] ECR I-11613, paragraphs 22 and 23; and \nBidar\n, paragraph 31).\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, a Union citizen lawfully resident in the territory of the host Member State can rely on Article 12 EC in all situations which fall within the scope ratione materiae of Community law (see \nMart\u00ednez Sala\n, paragraph 63; \nGrzelczyk\n, paragraph 32; and \nBidar\n, paragraph 32).\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those situations include those involving the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty and those involving the exercise of the right to move and reside within the territory of the Member States, as conferred by Article 18 EC (see, to that effect, \nBidar\n, paragraph 33 and the case-law cited).\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from Paragraph 1 of the AZRG, read in conjunction with the general administrative circular of the Federal Ministry of the Interior of 4 June 1996 relating to the AZRG and to the regulation implementing that Law, that the system of storage and processing of personal data put in place through the AZR concerns all Union citizens who are not nationals of the Federal Republic of Germany and who reside in Germany for a period of over three months, irrespective of the reasons which lead them to reside there.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being the case, since Mr Huber exercised his freedom to move and reside within that territory as conferred by Article 18 EC, reference should, having regard to the circumstances of the main proceedings, be made to Article 12(1) EC in order to determine whether a system for the storage and processing of personal data such as that at issue in the main proceedings is compatible with the principle that any discrimination on grounds of nationality is prohibited, in so far as those data are stored and processed for the purposes of fighting crime.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should be pointed out that the order for reference does not contain any detailed information which would allow it to be established whether the situation at issue in the main proceedings is covered by Article 43 EC. However, even if the national court were to consider that to be the case, the application of the principle of non-discrimination cannot vary depending on whether it finds its basis in that provision or on Article 12(1) EC, read in conjunction with Article 18(1) EC. \n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is settled case-law that the principle of non-discrimination, which has its basis in Articles 12 EC and 43 EC, requires that comparable situations must not be treated differently and that different situations must not be treated in the same way. Such treatment may be justified only if it is based on objective considerations independent of the nationality of the persons concerned and is proportionate to the objective being legitimately pursued (see, to that effect, Case C-164/07 \nWood \n[2008] ECR I-0000, paragraph 13 and the case-law cited).\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is therefore, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, necessary to compare the situation of Union citizens who are not nationals of the Member State concerned and who are resident in the territory of that Member State with that of nationals of that Member State as regards the objective of fighting crime. In fact, the German Government relies only on that aspect of the protection of public order.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although that objective is a legitimate one, it cannot be relied on in order to justify the systematic processing of personal data when that processing is restricted to the data of Union citizens who are not nationals of the Member State concerned.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General noted at point 21 of his Opinion, the fight against crime, in the general sense in which that term is used by the German Government in its observations, necessarily involves the prosecution of crimes and offences committed, irrespective of the nationality of their perpetrators.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, as regards a Member State, the situation of its nationals cannot, as regards the objective of fighting crime, be different from that of Union citizens who are not nationals of that Member State and who are resident in its territory.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the difference in treatment between those nationals and those Union citizens which arises by virtue of the systematic processing of personal data relating only to Union citizens who are not nationals of the Member State concerned for the purposes of fighting crime constitutes discrimination which is prohibited by Article 12(1) EC.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, Article 12(1) EC must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes the putting in place by a Member State, for the purpose of fighting crime, of a system for processing personal data specific to Union citizens who are not nationals of that Member State.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA system for processing personal data relating to Union citizens who are not nationals of the Member State concerned, such as that put in place by the Law on the central register of foreign nationals (Gesetz \u00fcber das Ausl\u00e4nderzentralregister) of 2 September 1994, as amended by the Law of 21 June 2005, and having as its object the provision of support to the national authorities responsible for the application of the law relating to the right of residence does not satisfy the requirement of necessity laid down by Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, interpreted in the light of the prohibition on any discrimination on grounds of nationality, unless:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nit contains only the data which are necessary for the application by those authorities of that legislation, and \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nits centralised nature enables the legislation relating to the right of residence to be more effectively applied as regards Union citizens who are not nationals of that Member State.\nIt is for the national court to ascertain whether those conditions are satisfied in the main proceedings.\nThe storage and processing of personal data containing individualised personal information in a register such as the Central Register of Foreign Nationals for statistical purposes cannot, on any basis, be considered to be necessary within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle 12(1) EC must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes the putting in place by a Member State, for the purpose of fighting crime, of a system for processing personal data specific to Union citizens who are not nationals of that Member State."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 22 Nov 2022, C-37/20 (\nLuxembourg Business Registers\n)\nCharter of

the European Parliament and of the Council of 30\u00a0May 2018 amending Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, and amending Directives 2009/138/EC and 2013/36/EU (OJ 2018 L\u00a0156, p.\u00a043), in so far as Article\u00a01(15)(c) amended point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20\u00a0May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, amending Regulation (EU) No\u00a0648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Directive 2006/70/EC (OJ 2015 L\u00a0141, p.\u00a073), and also the interpretation, first, of Article\u00a030(9) of Directive 2015/849, as amended by Directive 2018/843 (\u2018Directive 2015/849 as amended\u2019), and, secondly, of Article\u00a05(1)(a) to (c) and (f), Article\u00a025(2) and Articles\u00a044 to 50 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ 2016 L\u00a0119, p.\u00a01; \u2018the GDPR\u2019).\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The requests have been made in two sets of proceedings, the first between WM and Luxembourg Business Registers (\u2018LBR\u2019) (Case C-37/20) and the second between Sovim SA and LBR (Case C-601/20), concerning LBR\u2019s refusal to prevent the general public\u2019s access to information concerning, first, WM\u2019s status as the beneficial owner of a real estate company and, secondly, Sovim\u2019s beneficial owner.\n\u00a0\nLegal context\n\u00a0\nEuropean Union law\n\u00a0\nDirectives 2015/849, 2018/843, and 2015/849 as amended\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a04, 30, 31, 34, 36 and 38 of Directive 2018/843 state:\n\u2018(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 [it is necessary] to further increase the overall transparency of the economic and financial environment of the Union\u00a0\u2026 The prevention of money laundering and of terrorist financing cannot be effective unless the environment is hostile to criminals seeking shelter for their finances through non-transparent structures. The integrity of the Union financial system is dependent on the transparency of corporate and other legal entities, trusts and similar legal arrangements. This Directive aims not only to detect and investigate money laundering, but also to prevent it from occurring. Enhancing transparency could be a powerful deterrent.\n\u2026\n(30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Public access to beneficial ownership information allows greater scrutiny of information by civil society, including by the press or civil society organisations, and contributes to preserving trust in the integrity of business transactions and of the financial system. It can contribute to combating the misuse of corporate and other legal entities and legal arrangements for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, both by helping investigations and through reputational effects, given that anyone who could enter into transactions is aware of the identity of the beneficial owners. It also facilitates the timely and efficient availability of information for financial institutions as well as authorities, including authorities of third countries, involved in combating such offences. The access to that information would also help investigations on money laundering, associated predicate offences and terrorist financing.\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Confidence in financial markets from investors and the general public depends in large part on the existence of an accurate disclosure regime that provides transparency in the beneficial ownership and control structures of companies.\u00a0\u2026 The potential increase in confidence in financial markets should be regarded as a positive side effect and not the purpose of increasing transparency, which is to create an environment less likely to be used for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\u2026\n(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In all cases, both with regard to corporate and other legal entities, as well as trusts and similar legal arrangements, a fair balance should be sought in particular between the general public interest in the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and the data subjects\u2019 fundamental rights. The set of data to be made available to the public should be limited, clearly and exhaustively defined, and should be of a general nature, so as to minimise the potential prejudice to the beneficial owners. At the same time, information made accessible to the public should not significantly differ from the data currently collected. In order to limit the interference with the right to respect for their private life in general and to protection of their personal data in particular, that information should relate essentially to the status of beneficial owners of corporate and other legal entities and of trusts and similar legal arrangements and should strictly concern the sphere of economic activity in which the beneficial owners operate.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, with the aim of ensuring a proportionate and balanced approach and to guarantee the rights to private life and personal data protection, it should be possible for Member States to provide for exemptions to the disclosure through the registers of beneficial ownership information and to access to such information, in exceptional circumstances, where that information would expose the beneficial owner to a disproportionate risk of fraud, kidnapping, blackmail, extortion, harassment, violence or intimidation. It should also be possible for Member States to require online registration in order to identify any person who requests information from the register, as well as the payment of a fee for access to the information in the register.\n\u2026\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[The GDPR] applies to the processing of personal data under this Directive. As a consequence, natural persons whose personal data are held in national registers as beneficial owners should be informed accordingly. Furthermore, only personal data that is up to date and corresponds to the actual beneficial owners should be made available and the beneficiaries should be informed about their rights under the current Union legal data protection framework\u00a0\u2026 and the procedures applicable for exercising those rights.

That application was rejected by decision of 6\u00a0February 2020.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 24\u00a0February 2020, Sovim brought an action before the referring court.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Principally, Sovim seeks a declaration that Article\u00a012 of the Law of 13\u00a0January 2019, pursuant to which access to certain information contained in the RBO is open to \u2018any person\u2019, and/or Article\u00a015 of that law are inapplicable and an order for the information provided by Sovim pursuant to Article\u00a03 of that law not to be made publicly accessible.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Sovim submits, in the first place, that granting public access to the identity and personal data of its beneficial owner would infringe the right to respect for private and family life and the right to the protection of personal data, enshrined respectively in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that company\u2019s view, the aims of Directive 2015/849 as amended, on the basis of which the Law of 13\u00a0January 2019 was introduced into Luxembourg law, are to identify the beneficial owners of companies used for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, as well as to ensure certainty in commercial relationships and market confidence. However, it has not been shown how granting the public entirely unrestricted access to the data held in the RBO enables those aims to be attained.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, Sovim submits that public access to personal data contained in the RBO constitutes an infringement of several provisions of the GDPR, in particular a number of fundamental principles set out in Article\u00a05(1) thereof.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the alternative, Sovim claims that the referring court should hold that there is a disproportionate risk in the present case, within the meaning of Article\u00a015(1) of the Law of 13\u00a0January 2019, and accordingly make an order requiring LBR to restrict access to the information referred to in Article\u00a03 of that law.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring court observes that Article\u00a015(1) of the Law of 13\u00a0January 2019 provides that LBR must carry out a case-by-case analysis of whether there are exceptional circumstances justifying a restriction of access to the RBO. While, in the context of that law, several questions have already been referred to the Court in Case C-37/20, concerning the interpretation of the concepts of \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019, \u2018risk\u2019 and \u2018disproportionate\u2019 risk, the present proceedings in Case C-601/20 also raise other issues, in particular that of whether the general public\u2019s access to some of the data in the RBO is compatible with the Charter and also with the GDPR.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the tribunal d\u2019arrondissement de Luxembourg (Luxembourg District Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a01(15)(c) of [Directive 2018/843], amending the first subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of [Directive 2015/849], in so far as it requires Member States to make information on beneficial owners accessible to the general public in all cases, with no requirement for a legitimate interest to be shown, a valid provision:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the light of the right to respect for private and family life guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the [Charter], interpreted in accordance with Article\u00a08 of the European Convention on Human Rights, having regard to the objectives stated, inter alia, in recitals\u00a030 and 31 of Directive 2018/843 relating, in particular, to efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing;

or\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the data controller responsible for such a register of beneficial ownership provides access to the personal data of beneficial owners to an unlimited and indeterminable number of persons?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a05(1)(b) of the GDPR, which requires the purposes of data processing to be limited, to be interpreted as not precluding that the personal data of a beneficial owner, recorded in a register of beneficial ownership established in accordance with Article\u00a030 of [Directive 2015/849 as amended], is accessible to the general public, in circumstances where the data controller cannot guarantee that those data will be used only for the purpose for which they were collected, which is, in essence, the combating of money laundering and terrorist financing\u00a0\u2013 a purpose in relation to which the general public is not the body responsible for compliance?\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a05(1)(c) of the GDPR, which requires data to be minimised, to be interpreted as not precluding the general public from having access, through a register of beneficial ownership established in accordance with Article\u00a030 of [Directive 2015/849 as amended], to data indicating, in addition to the beneficial owner\u2019s name, month and year of birth, nationality and country of residence, as well as the nature and extent of his or her beneficial interests, also his or her date and place of birth?\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does Article\u00a05(1)(f) of the GDPR, which requires data to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing, and thus guarantees the integrity and confidentiality of such data, not preclude the provision of access to the personal data of beneficial owners held in a register of beneficial ownership, established in accordance with Article\u00a030 of [Directive 2015/849 as amended], on an unlimited and unconditional basis and with no undertaking to preserve the confidentiality of those data?\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a025(2) of the GDPR, which guarantees data protection by default, providing in particular that, by default, personal data must not be made accessible without the individual\u2019s intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons, to be interpreted as not precluding:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that a register of beneficial ownership, established in accordance with Article\u00a030 of [Directive 2015/849 as amended], does not require members of the general public consulting the personal data of a beneficial owner on its website to create an account;

Under Article\u00a03(6) of that directive, beneficial owners mean any natural person (or persons) who ultimately owns or controls the customer and/or the natural person (or persons) on whose behalf a transaction or activity is being conducted.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 as amended requires Member States to ensure that the information on beneficial ownership is accessible in all cases to \u2018any member of the general public\u2019, while the second subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) states that the persons referred to in that point (c) must be permitted \u2018to access at least the name, the month and year of birth and the country of residence and nationality of the beneficial owner as well as the nature and extent of the beneficial interest held\u2019. Article\u00a030(5) adds, in its third subparagraph, that \u2018Member States may, under conditions to be determined in national law, provide for access to additional information enabling the identification of the beneficial owner\u2019, which \u2018shall include at least the date of birth or contact details in accordance with data protection rules.\u2019\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that since the data referred to in Article\u00a030(5) include information on identified individuals, namely the beneficial owners of corporate and other legal entities incorporated within the Member States\u2019 territory, the access of any member of the general public to those data affects the fundamental right to respect for private life, guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the Charter (see, by analogy, judgment of 21\u00a0June 2022, \nLigue des droits humains\n, C-817/19, EU:C:2022:491, paragraph\u00a094 and the case-law cited), it being of no relevance in that respect that the data concerned may relate to activities of a professional nature (see, by analogy, judgment of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraph\u00a059). In addition, making available those data to the general public in that manner constitutes the processing of personal data falling under Article\u00a08 of the Charter (see, by analogy, judgment of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraphs\u00a052 and 60).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that, as is apparent from the Court\u2019s settled case-law, making personal data available to third parties constitutes an interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, whatever the subsequent use of the information communicated. In that connection, it does not matter whether the information in question relating to private life is sensitive or whether the persons concerned have been inconvenienced in any way on account of that interference (judgment of 21\u00a0June 2022, \nLigue des droits humains\n, C-817/19, EU:C:2022:491, paragraph\u00a096 and the case-law cited).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership, provided for in Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 as amended, constitutes an interference with the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the seriousness of that interference, it is important to note that, in so far as the information made available to the general public relates to the identity of the beneficial owner as well as to the nature and extent of the beneficial interest held in corporate or other legal entities, that information is capable of enabling a profile to be drawn up concerning certain personal identifying data more or less extensive in nature depending on the configuration of national law, the state of the person\u2019s wealth and the economic sectors, countries and specific undertakings in which he or she has invested.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it is inherent in making that information available to the general public in such a manner that it is then accessible to a potentially unlimited number of persons, with the result that such processing of personal data is liable to enable that information to be freely accessed also by persons who, for reasons unrelated to the objective pursued by that measure, seek to find out about, inter alia, the material and financial situation of a beneficial owner (see, by analogy, judgment of 1\u00a0August 2022, \nVyriausioji tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija\n, C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601, paragraphs\u00a0102 and 103). That possibility is all the easier when, as is the case in Luxembourg, the data in question can be consulted on the internet.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the potential consequences for the data subjects resulting from possible abuse of their personal data are exacerbated by the fact that, once those data have been made available to the general public, they can not only be freely consulted, but also retained and disseminated and that, in the event of such successive processing, it becomes increasingly difficult, or even illusory, for those data subjects to defend themselves effectively against abuse.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership, provided for in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 as amended, constitutes a serious interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter (see, by analogy, judgment of 1\u00a0August 2022, \nVyriausioji tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija\n, C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601, paragraph\u00a0105).\n\u00a0\nThe justification for the interference resulting from the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society (judgment of 21\u00a0June 2022, \nLigue des droits humains\n, C-817/19, EU:C:2022:491, paragraph\u00a0112 and the case-law cited).\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the first sentence of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by the Charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. According to the second sentence of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made on those rights and freedoms only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others. In that connection, Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter states that personal data must, inter alia, be processed \u2018for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law\u2019.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nObservance of the principle of legality\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the requirement that any limitation on the exercise of fundamental rights must be provided for by law, this implies that the act which permits the interference with those rights must itself define the scope of the limitation on the exercise of the right concerned, bearing in mind, on the one hand, that that requirement does not preclude the limitation in question from being formulated in terms which are sufficiently open to be able to adapt to different scenarios and keep pace with changing circumstances and, on the other hand, that the Court may, where appropriate, specify, by means of interpretation, the actual scope of the limitation in the light of the very wording of the EU legislation in question as well as its general scheme and the objectives it pursues, as interpreted in view of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter (judgment of 21\u00a0June 2022, \nLigue des droits humains\n, C-817/19, EU:C:2022:491, paragraph\u00a0114 and the case-law cited).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that the limitation on the exercise of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, resulting from the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership, is provided for by an EU legislative act, namely Directive 2015/849 as amended. In addition, Article\u00a030(1) and (5) of that directive provides, first, for access by the general public to data relating to the identification of the beneficial owners and the beneficial interest which they hold, specifying that those data must be adequate, accurate and current, and expressly listing certain of those data to which any member of the general public must be allowed access. Secondly, Article\u00a030(9) of Directive 2015/849 as amended lays down the conditions under which Member States may provide for exemptions from such access.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the principle of legality must be considered to have been fulfilled.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRespect for the essence of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards respect for the essence of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, it should be noted that the information expressly referred to in the second subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 as amended may be classified into two distinct categories of data: the first comprising data relating to the identity of the beneficial owner (name, month and year of birth, and nationality) and the second comprising economic data (nature and extent of the beneficial interest held).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, while the second subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 as amended does not\u00a0\u2013 as is clear from the use of the expression \u2018at least\u2019\u00a0\u2013 contain an exhaustive list of the data which any member of the general public must be permitted to access, and the third subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) adds that Member States are entitled to provide for access to additional information, the fact remains that, in accordance with Article\u00a030(1), only \u2018adequate\u2019 information on beneficial owners and beneficial interests held may be obtained, held and, therefore, potentially made accessible to the public, which excludes, inter alia, information which is not adequately related to the purposes of that directive.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As it is, it does not appear that making available to the general public information which is so related would in any way undermine the essence of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should also be noted that Article\u00a041(1) of Directive 2015/849 as amended expressly provides that the processing of personal data under that directive is subject to Directive 95/46 and, therefore, to the GDPR, Article\u00a094(2) of which states that references to Directive 95/46 are to be construed as references to the GDPR. It is, therefore, established that any collection, storage and making available of information under Directive 2015/849 as amended must fully meet the requirements arising from the GDPR.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the interference entailed by the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership provided for in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 as amended does not undermine the essence of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe objective of general interest recognised by the European Union\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2015/849 as amended aims, in the words of Article\u00a01(1) thereof, to prevent the use of the European Union\u2019s financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing. In that regard, recital\u00a04 of Directive 2018/843 states that the pursuit of that objective cannot be effective unless the environment is hostile to criminals and that enhancing the overall transparency of the economic and financial environment of the European Union could be a powerful deterrent.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, more specifically, the objective of the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership, introduced by Article\u00a01(15)(c) of Directive 2018/843, recital\u00a030 of that directive states that such access, first of all, \u2018allows greater scrutiny of information by civil society, including by the press or civil society organisations, and contributes to preserving trust in the integrity of business transactions and of the financial system\u2019. Next, the access in question \u2018can contribute to combating the misuse of corporate and other legal entities and legal arrangements for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, both by helping investigations and through reputational effects, given that anyone who could enter into transactions is aware of the identity of the beneficial owners\u2019. Lastly, that access \u2018also facilitates the timely and efficient availability of information for financial institutions as well as authorities, including authorities of third countries, involved in combating such offences\u2019 and \u2018would also help investigations on money laundering, associated predicate offences and terrorist financing\u2019.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, recital\u00a031 of Directive 2018/843 states that \u2018the potential increase in confidence in financial markets should be regarded as a positive side effect and not the purpose of increasing transparency, which is to create an environment less likely to be used for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing\u2019.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, by providing for the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership, the EU legislature seeks to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing by creating, by means of increased transparency, an environment less likely to be used for those purposes.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That aim constitutes an objective of general interest that is capable of justifying even serious interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0June 2022, \nLigue des droits humains\n, C-817/19, EU:C:2022:491, paragraph\u00a0122 and the case-law cited).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as the Council of the European Union also refers, in that context, expressly to the principle of transparency, as follows from Articles\u00a01 and 10 TEU and from Article\u00a015 TFEU, it should be noted that that principle, as the Council itself states, enables citizens to participate more closely in the decision-making process and guarantees that the administration enjoys greater legitimacy and is more effective and more accountable to the citizen in a democratic system (judgment of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraph\u00a068 and the case-law cited).\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While, in that respect, the principle of transparency is given concrete expression primarily in the requirements of institutional and procedural transparency covering activities of a public nature, including the use of public funds, such a link with public institutions is lacking where, as in the present case, the measure at issue is intended to make available to the general public data concerning the identity of private beneficial owners and the nature and extent of their beneficial interests held in companies or other legal entities.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the principle of transparency, as it results from Articles\u00a01 and 10 TEU and from Article\u00a015 TFEU, cannot be considered, as such, an objective of general interest capable of justifying the interference with the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, which results from the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhether the interference at issue is appropriate, necessary and proportionate\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to settled case-law, the proportionality of the measures which result in interference with the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter requires compliance not only with the requirements of appropriateness and of necessity but also with that of the proportionate nature of those measures in relation to the objective pursued (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a093).\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, derogations from and limitations on the protection of personal data should apply only in so far as is strictly necessary, it being understood that where there is a choice between several measures appropriate to meeting the legitimate objectives pursued, recourse must be had to the least onerous. In addition, an objective of general interest may not be pursued without having regard to the fact that it must be reconciled with the fundamental rights affected by the measure, by properly balancing the objective of general interest against the rights at issue, in order to ensure that the disadvantages caused by that measure are not disproportionate to the aims pursued. Thus, the question whether a limitation on the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter may be justified must be assessed by measuring the seriousness of the interference which such a limitation entails and by verifying that the importance of the objective of general interest pursued by that limitation is proportionate to that seriousness (see, to that effect, judgments of 26\u00a0April 2022, \nPoland\n v \nParliament and Council\n, C-401/19, EU:C:2022:297, paragraph\u00a065, and of 21\u00a0June 2022, \nLigue des droits humains\n, C-817/19, EU:C:2022:491, paragraphs\u00a0115 and 116 and the case-law cited).\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in order to satisfy the proportionality requirement, the legislation in question entailing the interference must also lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measures provided for and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the data subjects have sufficient guarantees to protect effectively their personal data against the risk of abuse. It must, in particular, indicate in what circumstances and under which conditions a measure providing for the processing of such data may be adopted, thereby ensuring that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data are made accessible to the general public, and thus to a potentially unlimited number of persons, and are liable to reveal sensitive data on the data subjects (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0June 2022, \nLigue des droits humains\n, C-817/19, EU:C:2022:491, paragraph\u00a0117 and the case-law cited).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with that case-law, it is necessary to ascertain, first, whether the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership is appropriate for attaining the objective of general interest pursued, secondly, whether the interference with the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter which results from such access is limited to what is strictly necessary, in the sense that the objective could not reasonably be achieved in an equally effective manner by other means less prejudicial to those fundamental rights of the data subjects, and, thirdly, whether that interference is not disproportionate to that objective, which implies, in particular, a balancing of the importance of the objective and the seriousness of the interference.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it must be held that the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership is appropriate for contributing to the attainment of the objective of general interest, identified in paragraph\u00a058 above, of seeking to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, since the public nature of that access and the increased transparency resulting therefrom contribute to the creation of an environment less likely to be used for such purposes.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, in order to demonstrate that the interference resulting from the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership is strictly necessary, the Council and the Commission refer to the impact assessment accompanying the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing and amending Directive 2009/101/EC (COM(2016) 450 final), which gave rise to Directive 2018/843. According to those institutions, whereas point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849, in the version prior to its amendment by Directive 2018/843, made access by any person to information on beneficial ownership conditional upon that person being able to demonstrate a \u2018legitimate interest\u2019, that impact assessment found that the lack of a uniform definition of that concept of \u2018legitimate interest\u2019 had given rise to practical difficulties, with the result that it was considered that the appropriate solution was to remove that condition.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in their written observations, the Parliament, the Council and the Commission state, referring in particular to recital\u00a030 of Directive 2018/843, that the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership, as provided for by Directive 2015/849 as amended, has a deterrent effect, enables greater scrutiny and facilitates the conduct of investigations, including those carried out by the authorities of third countries, and that those consequences could not be achieved in any other way.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the hearing, the Commission was asked to indicate whether it had considered proposing a uniform definition of \u2018legitimate interest\u2019, in order to offset the risk that the obligation for any person or organisation to demonstrate such an interest, as initially provided for by Directive 2015/849, might lead to excessive limitations on access to information on beneficial ownership, owing to differences in the definition of \u2018legitimate interest\u2019 in the Member States.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In response to that question, the Commission observed that the criterion of \u2018legitimate interest\u2019 was a concept which did not lend itself easily to a legal definition and that, while it had considered the possibility of proposing a uniform definition of that criterion, it had ultimately decided not to do so on the ground that the criterion, even if defined, remained difficult to apply and that its application could give rise to arbitrary decisions.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be noted that the fact that it may be difficult to provide a detailed definition of the circumstances and conditions under which the public may access information on beneficial ownership is no reason for the EU legislature to provide for the general public to access that information (see, by analogy, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022,\n Commissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a084).\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, nor can the effects relied on and the reference made, in that context, to the explanations set out in recital\u00a030 of Directive 2018/843 establish that the interference at issue is strictly necessary.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent that that recital states that the general public\u2019s access to beneficial ownership information allows greater scrutiny of information by civil society, and that express reference is made in that regard to the press and to civil society organisations, it should be found that both the press and civil society organisations that are connected with the prevention and combating of money laundering and terrorist financing have a legitimate interest in accessing information on beneficial ownership. The same is true of the persons, also mentioned in that recital, who wish to know the identity of the beneficial owners of a company or other legal entity because they are likely to enter into transactions with them, or of the financial institutions and authorities involved in combating offences of money laundering or terrorist financing, in so far as those entities do not already have access to the information in question on the basis of points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 as amended.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, although it is stated in recital\u00a030 of Directive 2018/843 that the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership \u2018can contribute\u2019 to combating the misuse of corporate and other legal entities and that it \u2018would also help\u2019 criminal investigations, it must be found that such considerations are also not such as to demonstrate that that measure is strictly necessary to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, it cannot be considered that the interference with the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, which results from the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership, is limited to what is strictly necessary.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, as regards the factors put forward to establish that the interference at issue is proportionate, in that, in particular, the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership, provided for in Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 as amended, is based on a proper balance between, on the one hand, the objective of general interest pursued and, on the other, the fundamental rights at issue, and that there are sufficient safeguards against the risks of abuse, the following points must be made.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, the Commission contends that, as is apparent from recital\u00a034 of Directive 2018/843, the EU legislature took care to specify that the set of data made available to the public must be limited, clearly and exhaustively defined, and must be of a general nature, so as to minimise the potential prejudice to beneficial owners. It is in that context that, on the basis of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 as amended, only data strictly necessary to identify the beneficial owners and the nature and extent of their interests would be accessible to the public.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, the Parliament, the Council and the Commission state that the principle that the general public should have access to information on beneficial ownership may be derogated from, since Article\u00a030(9) of Directive 2015/849 as amended provides that in \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019, \u2018Member States may provide for an exemption from such access to all or part of the information on the beneficial ownership on a case-by-case basis\u2019 where the general public\u2019s access to that information \u2018would expose the beneficial owner to disproportionate risk, risk of fraud, kidnapping, blackmail, extortion, harassment, violence or intimidation, or where the beneficial owner is a minor or otherwise legally incapable\u2019.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, both the Parliament and the Commission observe that, as is apparent from Article\u00a030(5a) of Directive 2015/849 as amended, read in conjunction with recital\u00a036 of Directive 2018/843, Member States may make the information on beneficial ownership available on condition of online registration in order to identify the person requesting that information. In addition, in accordance with recital\u00a038 of Directive 2018/843, in order to prevent the abuse of the information on beneficial ownership, Member States might make information relating to the requesting person along with the legal basis for their request available to the beneficial owner.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, as recalled in paragraph\u00a051 above, the second subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 as amended provides that any member of the general public is to be permitted to access \u2018at least\u2019 the data referred to in that provision, and the third subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) adds that Member States may provide for access to \u2018additional information enabling the identification of the beneficial owner\u2019, which includes \u2018at least\u2019 the date of birth or the contact details of the beneficial owner concerned.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it is apparent from the use of the expression \u2018at least\u2019 that those provisions allow for data to be made available to the public which are not sufficiently defined and identifiable. Consequently, the substantive rules governing interference with the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter do not meet the requirement of clarity and precision recalled in paragraph\u00a065 above (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0160).\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as regards the balancing of the seriousness of that interference, identified in paragraphs\u00a041 to 44 above, against the importance of the objective of general interest of preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, it must be held that although in view of its importance that objective is, as found in paragraph\u00a059 above, capable of justifying even serious interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, the fact remains that, first, combating money laundering and terrorist financing is as a priority a matter for the public authorities and for entities such as credit or financial institutions which, by reason of their activities, are subject to specific obligations in that regard.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, it is for that reason that points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 as amended provide that information on beneficial ownership must be accessible, in all cases, to competent authorities and Financial Intelligence Units, without any restriction, as well as to obliged entities, within the framework of customer due diligence.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, in comparison with a regime such as that laid down in the version of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 prior to the entry into force of Directive 2018/843\u00a0\u2013 which provided, in addition to access by the competent authorities and certain entities, for access by any person or organisation capable of demonstrating a legitimate interest\u00a0\u2013 the regime introduced by Directive 2018/843, providing for the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership, amounts to a considerably more serious interference with the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, without that increased interference being capable of being offset by any benefits which might result from the latter regime as compared against the former regime, in terms of combating money laundering and terrorist financing (see, by analogy, judgment of 1\u00a0August 2022, \nVyriausioji tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija\n, C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601, paragraph\u00a0112).\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the optional provisions of Article\u00a030(5a) and (9) of Directive 2015/849 as amended, which allow Member States to make information on beneficial ownership available on condition of online registration and to provide, in exceptional circumstances, for an exemption from access to that information by the general public, respectively, are not, in themselves, capable of demonstrating either a proper balance between the objective of general interest pursued and the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, or the existence of sufficient safeguards enabling data subjects to protect their personal data effectively against the risks of abuse.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the Commission\u2019s reference to the judgment of 9\u00a0March 2017, \nManni\n (C-398/15, EU:C:2017:197),\u00a0\u2013 concerning compulsory disclosure by companies, including of their representatives in legal proceedings, provided for in First Council Directive 68/151/EEC of 9\u00a0March 1968 on co-ordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article\u00a058 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community (OJ 1968 L\u00a065, p.\u00a08), as amended by Directive 2003/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\u00a0July 2003 (OJ 2003 L\u00a0221, p.\u00a03)\u00a0\u2013 is irrelevant in that context. Indeed, the compulsory disclosure provided for by that directive, on the one hand, and the general public\u2019s access to information on beneficial ownership, provided for by Directive 2015/849 as amended, on the other, differ both in their respective purposes and in their scope in terms of the personal data covered.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question referred in Case C-601/20 is that Article\u00a01(15)(c) of Directive 2018/843 is invalid in so far as it amended point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 in such a way that point (c), as thus amended, provides that Member States must ensure that information on the beneficial ownership of companies and of other legal entities incorporated within their territory is accessible in all cases to any member of the general public.\n\u00a0\nThe second and third questions referred in Case \nC\n-\n601\n/20 and the questions referred in Case \nC\n-\n37\n/20\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second question referred in Case C-601/20 and the questions referred in Case C-37/20 are based on the premiss that Article\u00a030(5) of Directive 2015/849 as amended is valid, in so far as it provides for public access to information on beneficial ownership.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in view of the answer to the first question referred in Case C-601/20, there is no need to examine those questions.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in the light of that same answer, there is also no need to adjudicate on the third question referred in Case C-601/20.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a01(15)(c) of Directive (EU) 2018/843 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30\u00a0May 2018 amending Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, and amending Directives 2009/138/EC and 2013/36/EU, is invalid in so far as it amended point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20\u00a0May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, amending Regulation (EU) No\u00a0648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Directive 2006/70/EC, in such a way that point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a030(5), as thus amended, provides that Member States must ensure that information on the beneficial ownership of companies and of other legal entities incorporated within their territory is accessible in all cases to any member of the general public."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

For the financial year 2008 they made applications to the competent local authorities for funds from the EAGF or the EAFRD, which were approved by decisions of 5\u00a0December 2008 (Case C-93/09) and 31\u00a0December 2008 (Case C-92/09).\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In each case the application form contained the following statement:\n\u2018I am aware that Article 44a of Regulation \u2026 No\u00a01290/2005 requires publication of information on the beneficiaries of [funds from] the EAGF and the EAFRD and the amounts received per beneficiary. The publication relates to all measures applied for in connection with the Common Application, which constitutes the single application for the purposes of Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004, and is effected annually at the latest by 31\u00a0March of the following year.\u2019\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court explains that the Bundesanstalt\u2019s website makes available to the public the names of beneficiaries of aid from the EAGF and the EAFRD, the place in which they are established or reside and the postcode of that place, and the annual amounts received. The site is provided with a search tool.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 26\u00a0September 2008 (Case C-92/09) and 18\u00a0December 2008 (Case C-93/09) the applicants in the main proceedings brought proceedings to prevent publication of the data relating to them. In their view, publication of the amounts received from the EAGF or the EAFRD is not justified by overriding public interests. Moreover, the rules governing the European Social Fund do not provide for beneficiaries to be identified by name. In their applications, they ask for the \nLand\n of Hesse to be ordered to refrain from, or to be prohibited from, transmitting or publishing those data for the purposes of the general publication of information on the financial amounts granted to them from the EAGF and the EAFRD.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \nLand\n of Hesse, which takes the view that the obligation to publish data relating to the applicants in the main proceedings follows from Regulations No\u00a01290/2005 and No\u00a0259/2008, nevertheless undertook not to publish the amounts received by them as beneficiaries of aid from the EAGF and the EAFRD pending final decisions in the main proceedings.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court believes that the obligation to publish under Article 44a of Regulation No 1290/2005 constitutes an unjustified interference with the fundamental right to the protection of personal data. It considers that that provision, which pursues the aim of increasing the transparency of the use of European funds, does not improve the prevention of irregularities, since extensive control mechanisms exist at present for that purpose. On the basis of the judgment in Joined Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n [2003] ECR I-4989, it takes the view that, in any event, that obligation to publish is not proportionate to the aim pursued. Moreover, in its view, Article 42(8b) of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 gives the Commission too broad a discretion with respect to determining both the data to be published and the means of publication and is therefore incompatible with the third indent of Article 202\u00a0EC and with the fourth indent of Article 211\u00a0EC.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regardless of the validity of Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No 1290/2005, the referring court considers that Regulation No 259/2008, which prescribes that the information relating to the beneficiaries of aid from the EAGF and the EAFRD is to be published exclusively on the internet, breaches the fundamental right to the protection of personal data. It points out that the latter regulation does not limit access to the internet site concerned to \u2018internet protocol\u2019 (IP) addresses situated in the European Union. Furthermore, it is not possible to withdraw the data from the internet after the expiry of the two-year period laid down in Article 3(3) of Regulation No\u00a0259/2008. It its view, publication of the data exclusively on the internet also has a deterrent effect. First, citizens wishing to obtain information must have access to the internet. Second, those citizens run the risk of having their data stored under Directive 2006/24. It is paradoxical to strengthen the supervision of telecommunications on the one hand and to provide on the other hand that information which is intended to enable citizens to participate in public affairs is available only electronically.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In case the Court should find that the provisions referred to in paragraphs 30 and 31 above are not invalid, the referring court further seeks an interpretation of a number of provisions of Directive 95/46. It considers that the publication of personal data may take place only if the measures provided for in the second indent of Article 18(2) of that directive have been taken. According to the information provided by the referring court, the German legislature, in particular that of the \nLand\n of Hesse, has made use of the possibility under that provision. However, according to that court, the notification by the Ministry of the Environment, Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection of the \nLand\n of Hesse to the personal data protection official was incomplete. Some information was not communicated to that official, such as the fact that the data are processed by the Bundesanstalt on behalf of the \nLand\n, in some cases with the assistance of a private third party, specific details of the deletion period and the access provider, and information on the registration of IP addresses.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, according to the national court, the publication of the data relating to the beneficiaries of agricultural aid ought to have been preceded by a prior check as provided for in Article 20 of Directive 95/46. In the present case, however, a prior check was carried out, not by a central supervisory authority, but by the data protection official of the undertaking or office responsible, on the basis of incomplete notifications.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the referring court is uncertain as to the lawfulness, from the point of view of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, of the registration of the IP addresses of users who consult the information relating to beneficiaries of aid from the EAGF and the EAFRD on the Bundesanstalt\u2019s website.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Verwaltungsgericht (Administrative Court) Wiesbaden decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions, which are worded identically in Case C-92/09 and Case C-93/09, to the Court for preliminary rulings:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are Article [42](8b) and Article 44a of \u2026 Regulation \u2026 No 1290/2005 \u2026, inserted by \u2026 Regulation \u2026 No 1437/2007 \u2026, invalid?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is \u2026 Regulation \u2026 No\u00a0259/2008 \u2026\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0invalid, or\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0valid by reason only of the fact that Directive 2006/24 \u2026 is invalid?\nIf the provisions mentioned in the first and second questions are valid:\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the second indent of Article 18(2) of Directive 95/46 \u2026 be interpreted as meaning that publication in accordance with \u2026 Regulation \u2026 No\u00a0259/2008 \u2026 may be effected only following implementation of the procedure \u2013 in lieu of notification to a supervisory authority \u2013 established by that article?\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article 20 of Directive 95/46 \u2026 be interpreted as meaning that publication in accordance with \u2026 Regulation \u2026 No\u00a0259/2008 \u2026 may be effected only following exercise of the prior check required by national law in that case?\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the fourth question is answered in the affirmative: Must Article 20 of Directive 95/46 \u2026 be interpreted as meaning that no effective prior check has been performed, if it was effected on the basis of a register established in accordance with the second indent of Article 18(2) of that directive which lacks an item of information prescribed?\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article 7 \u2013 and in this case, in particular, subparagraph (e) \u2013 of Directive 95/46 \u2026 be interpreted as precluding a practice of storing the IP addresses of the users of a homepage without their express consent?\u2019\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By order of the President of the Court of 4 May 2009, Cases C-92/09 and C-93/09 were joined for the purposes of the written and oral procedure and the judgment.\nIII \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decisions for reference contain questions on the validity of Regulations No\u00a01290/2005 and No 259/2008 (Questions 1 and 2) and questions on the interpretation of Directive 95/46 (Questions 3 to 6). Before examining the substance of the case, the admissibility of the second part of Question 2 and of Question 6 should be considered.\nA \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\nAdmissibility\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the second part of Question 2 and by Question 6 respectively, the referring court asks the Court to rule on the validity of Directive 2006/24 and on the interpretation of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, so as to enable it to assess whether the retention of certain data relating to the users of the internet sites, laid down by European Union and German legislation, is lawful.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be recalled at the outset that although, in view of the division of responsibilities in the preliminary-ruling procedure, it is for the referring court alone to determine the subject-matter of the questions which it proposes to refer to the Court, the Court has held that, in exceptional circumstances, it will examine the conditions in which the case was referred to it by the national court, in order to assess whether it has jurisdiction (Case C-567/07 \nWoningstichting Sint Servatius\n [2009] ECR I-9021, paragraph 42).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is the case in particular where the problem referred to the Court is purely hypothetical or where the interpretation or consideration of the validity of a rule of European Union law which is sought by the national court has no relation to the actual facts of the main action or to its purpose (see, to that effect, Case C-415/93 \nBosman\n [1995] ECR I-4921, paragraph 61; Case C-466/04 \nAcereda Herrera\n [2006] ECR I-5341, paragraph 48; Case C-380/05 \nCentro Europa 7\n [2008] ECR I-349, paragraph 53; and \nWoningstichting Sint Servatius\n, paragraph 43).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the decisions for reference, the applicants in the main proceedings each brought proceedings before the referring court against the publication under Regulations No\u00a01290/2005 and No\u00a0259/2008 of data relating to them. Their applications seek for the \nLand\n of Hesse to refrain from transmitting or publishing, or to refuse to transmit or publish, the information concerning the aid which they have received from the EAGF and the EAFRD.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second part of Question 2 and Question 6 have no relation to the subject-matter of the disputes in the main proceedings. They relate, not to the publication of data relating to the beneficiaries of aid under those Funds, such as the applicants in the main proceedings, but to the retention of data relating to persons consulting websites. Since consideration of the second part of Question 2 and Question 6 is therefore of no relevance for the outcome of the main proceedings, there is no need to answer them.\nB \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\nSubstance\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Question 1 and the first part of Question 2\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preliminary observations\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 1 and the first part of Question 2, the national court asks the Court to examine the validity, first, of Article 44a of Regulation No 1290/2005 and of Regulation No 259/2008 containing the detailed rules for the application of the publication obligation laid down by Article 44a and, second, of Article 42(8b) of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005, the provision which is the legal basis of Regulation No\u00a0259/2008.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court considers that the obligation to publish data relating to the beneficiaries of aid from the EAGF and the EAFRD, which follows from the provisions cited in the previous paragraph, constitutes an unjustified interference with the fundamental right to the protection of personal data. It refers essentially to Article 8 of the Convention.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article 6(1) TEU, the European Union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019), \u2018which shall have the same legal value as the Treaties\u2019.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the validity of Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and of Regulation No 259/2008 must be assessed in the light of the provisions of the Charter.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, Article 8(1) of the Charter states that \u2018[e]veryone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her\u2019. That fundamental right is closely connected with the right to respect of private life expressed in Article 7 of the Charter.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right to the protection of personal data is not, however, an absolute right, but must be considered in relation to its function in society (see, to that effect, Case C-112/00 \nSchmidberger\n [2003] ECR I-5659, paragraph 80 and the case-law cited).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 8(2) of the Charter thus authorises the processing of personal data if certain conditions are satisfied. It provides that personal data \u2018must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law\u2019.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, Article 52(1) of the Charter accepts that limitations may be imposed on the exercise of rights such as those set forth in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, as long as the limitations are provided for by law, respect the essence of those rights and freedoms and, subject to the principle of proportionality, are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, according to Article 52(3) of the Charter, in so far as it contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention, the meaning and scope of those rights are to be the same as those laid down by the Convention. Article 53 of the Charter further states that nothing in the Charter is to be interpreted as restricting or adversely affecting the rights recognised inter alia by the Convention.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it must be considered that the right to respect for private life with regard to the processing of personal data, recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, concerns any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (see, in particular, European Court of Human Rights, \nAmann v. Switzerland\n [GC], no. 27798/95, \u00a7\u00a065, ECHR 2000-II, and \nRotaru v. Romania\n [GC], no. 28341/95, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 2000-V) and the limitations which may lawfully be imposed on the right to the protection of personal data correspond to those tolerated in relation to Article 8 of the Convention.\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The validity of Article 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and of Regulation No\u00a0259/2008\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be recalled, in the first place, that the publication required by Article 44a of Regulation No 1290/2005 and Regulation No 259/2008 implementing that article identifies by name all beneficiaries of aid from the EAGF and the EAFRD, among whom are both natural and legal persons. Having regard to the observations in paragraph 52 above, legal persons can claim the protection of Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter in relation to such identification only in so far as the official title of the legal person identifies one or more natural persons.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is the case with the applicant in the main proceedings in Case C-92/09. The official title of the partnership in question directly identifies natural persons who are its partners.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it must be ascertained whether Article 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and Regulation No 259/2008 interfere with the rights guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter to beneficiaries of aid from the EAGF or the EAFRD who are identified or identifiable natural persons (\u2018the beneficiaries concerned\u2019), and, if so, whether such an interference is justified having regard to Article 52 of the Charter.\ni)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Existence of an interference with the rights recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 44a of Regulation No 1290/2005 requires the Member States to ensure the annual \nex-post\n publication of the names of the beneficiaries of aid from the EAGF and the EAFRD and the amounts received by each beneficiary from each of those Funds. It follows from recital 14 in the preamble to Regulation No 1437/2007 amending Regulation No 1290/2005 that that information must be the subject of \u2018general publication\u2019.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation No 259/2008 lays down the content of the publication and prescribes that, in addition to the matters mentioned in the preceding paragraph and other information regarding the aid received, \u2018the municipality where the beneficiary resides or is registered and, where available, the postal code or the part thereof identifying the municipality\u2019 must be published. Article 2 of that regulation prescribes that the information is to be made available on a single website per Member State and may be consulted by means of a search tool.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not disputed that the amounts which the beneficiaries concerned receive from the EAGF and the EAFRD represent part of their income, often a considerable part. Because the information becomes available to third parties, publication on a website of data naming those beneficiaries and indicating the precise amounts received by them thus constitutes an interference with their private life within the meaning of Article 7 of the Charter (see, to that effect, \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, paragraphs 73 and 74).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is of no relevance in this respect that the data published concerns activities of a professional nature (see \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, paragraphs 73 and 74). The European Court of Human Rights has held on this point, with reference to the interpretation of Article 8 of the Convention, that the term \u2018private life\u2019 must not be interpreted restrictively and that \u2018there is no reason of principle to justify excluding activities of a professional \u2026 nature from the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d\u2019 (see, inter alia, \nAmann v. Switzerland\n, \u00a7\u00a065, and \nRotaru v. Romania\n, \u00a7\u00a043).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the publication required by Article 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and Regulation No 259/2008 constitutes the processing of personal data falling under Article 8(2) of the Charter.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \nLand\n of Hesse casts doubt, however, on the very existence of an interference with the private life of the applicants in the main proceedings, as they were informed in the aid application form of the mandatory publication of the data relating to them and, in accordance with Article 8(2) of the Charter, gave their consent to that publication by submitting their applications.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On this point, it should be noted that Article 42(8b) of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 provides only that \u2018the beneficiaries of funds are informed that these data [concerning them, namely their names and the amounts received from each of the Funds] may be made public\u2019. Article 4(1) of Regulation No 259/2008 contains a similar provision, stating that \u2018Member States shall inform the beneficiaries that their data will be made public\u2019.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The European Union legislation in question, which merely provides that beneficiaries of aid are to be informed in advance that the data concerning them will be published, thus does not seek to base the personal data processing for which it provides on the consent of the beneficiaries concerned. Furthermore, it must be noted that in the main proceedings, in their aid application forms, the applicants stated only that they were \u2018aware that Article 44a of Regulation \u2026 No\u00a01290/2005 requires publication of information on the beneficiaries of [funds from] the EAGF and the EAFRD\u2019.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the publication of data by name relating to the beneficiaries concerned and the precise amounts received by them from the EAGF and the EAFRD constitutes an interference, as regards those beneficiaries, with the rights recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, and since such processing of personal data is not based on the consent of those beneficiaries, it is necessary to examine whether the interference is justified having regard to Article 52(1) of the Charter.\nii)\u00a0\u00a0Justification of the interference with the rights recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 52(1) of the Charter accepts that limitations may be imposed on the exercise of rights such as those set forth in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, as long as the limitations are provided for by law, respect the essence of those rights and freedoms, and, subject to the principle of proportionality, are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, it is common ground that the interference arising from the publication on a website of data by name relating to the beneficiaries concerned must be regarded as \u2018provided for by law\u2019 within the meaning of Article 52(1) of the Charter. Articles 1(1) and 2 of Regulation No 259/2008 expressly provide for such publication.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, on the question whether that interference meets an objective of general interest recognised by the European Union within the meaning of Article 52(1) of the Charter, it follows from recital 14 in the preamble to Regulation No 1437/2007 amending Regulation No 1290/2005 and from recital 6 in the preamble to Regulation No 259/2008 that publication of the names of the beneficiaries of aid from the EAGF and the EAFRD and of the amounts which they receive from those Funds is intended to \u2018[enhance] transparency regarding the use of Community funds in the [CAP] and [improve] the sound financial management of these funds, in particular by reinforcing public control of the money used\u2019.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principle of transparency is stated in Articles 1\u00a0TEU and 10\u00a0TEU and in Article 15\u00a0TFEU. It enables citizens to participate more closely in the decision-making process and guarantees that the administration enjoys greater legitimacy and is more effective and more accountable to the citizen in a democratic system (see Case C-41/00\u00a0P \nInterporc\n v \nCommission\n [2003] ECR I-2125, paragraph 39, and Case C-28/08\u00a0P \nCommission\n v \nBavarian Lager\n [2010] ECR I-0000, paragraph 54).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By reinforcing public control of the use of the money from the EAGF and the EAFRD, the publication required by the provisions whose validity is contested contributes to the appropriate use of public funds by the administration (see, to that effect, \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, paragraph 81).\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, that publication relating to the use of money paid out by the agricultural Funds will enable citizens to participate more closely in the public debate surrounding decisions on the direction to be taken by the CAP.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, by aiming to increase the transparency of the use of funds in the context of the CAP, Article 44a of Regulation No 1290/2005 and Regulation No\u00a0259/2008 pursue an objective of general interest recognised by the European Union.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, it is also necessary to ascertain whether the limitation imposed on the rights conferred by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, inter alia, European Court of Human Rights, \nGillow v. United Kingdom\n, 24 November 1986, \u00a7\u00a055, Series A no. 109, and \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, paragraph 83).\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicants in the main proceedings observe that the data whose publication is provided for in Article 44a of Regulation No 1290/2005 and in Regulation No\u00a0259/2008 allows third parties to draw conclusions as to their income. They explain that the aid represents between 30% and 70% of the total income of the beneficiaries concerned. The legitimate interests of the public would, they argue, be satisfied by the publication of anonymous statistics.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is settled case-law that the principle of proportionality, which is one of the general principles of European Union law, requires that measures implemented by acts of the European Union are appropriate for attaining the objective pursued and do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve it (Case C-58/08 \nVodafone and Others\n [2010] ECR I-0000, paragraph 51 and the case-law cited).\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not disputed that the publication on the internet of data by name relating to the beneficiaries concerned and the precise amounts received by them from the EAGF and the EAFRD is liable to increase transparency with respect to the use of the agricultural aid concerned. Such information made available to citizens reinforces public control of the use to which that money is put and contributes to the best use of public funds.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to whether the measure is necessary, it must be recalled that the objective of the publication at issue may not be pursued without having regard to the fact that that objective must be reconciled with the fundamental rights set forth in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter (see, to that effect, Case C-73/07 \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n [2008] ECR I-9831, paragraph 53).\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is thus necessary to determine whether the Council of the European Union and the Commission balanced the European Union\u2019s interest in guaranteeing the transparency of its acts and ensuring the best use of public funds against the interference with the right of the beneficiaries concerned to respect for their private life in general and to the protection of their personal data in particular. The Court has held in this respect that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (\nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, paragraph 56).\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States which have submitted written observations to the Court, the Council and the Commission argue that the objective pursued by the publication required by Article 44a of Regulation No 1290/2005 and by Regulation No\u00a0259/2008 could not be achieved by measures which interfere less with the right of the beneficiaries concerned to respect for their private life in general and the protection of their personal data in particular. Information limited to those of the beneficiaries concerned who receive aid exceeding a certain threshold would, it is submitted, not give taxpayers an accurate image of the CAP. Taxpayers would have the impression that there were only \u2018big\u2019 beneficiaries of aid from the agricultural Funds, whereas there are numerous \u2018little\u2019 ones. Limiting publication to legal persons only would not be satisfactory either. The Commission submits in this connection that the largest beneficiaries of agricultural aid include natural persons.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While it is true that in a democratic society taxpayers have a right to be kept informed of the use of public funds (\n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, paragraph 85), the fact remains that striking a proper balance between the various interests involved made it necessary for the institutions, before adopting the provisions whose validity is contested, to ascertain whether publication via a single freely consultable website in each Member State of data by name relating to all the beneficiaries concerned and the precise amounts received by each of them from the EAGF and the EAFRD \u2013 with no distinction being drawn according to the duration, frequency or nature and amount of the aid received \u2013 did not go beyond what was necessary for achieving the legitimate aims pursued, having regard in particular to the interference with the rights guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter resulting from such publication.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As far as natural persons benefiting from aid under the EAGF and the EAFRD are concerned, however, it does not appear that the Council and the Commission sought to strike such a balance between the European Union\u2019s interest in guaranteeing the transparency of its acts and ensuring the best use of public funds, on the one hand, and the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, on the other.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is nothing to show that, when adopting Article 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and Regulation No 259/2008, the Council and the Commission took into consideration methods of publishing information on the beneficiaries concerned which would be consistent with the objective of such publication while at the same time causing less interference with those beneficiaries\u2019 right to respect for their private life in general and to protection of their personal data in particular, such as limiting the publication of data by name relating to those beneficiaries according to the periods for which they received aid, or the frequency or nature and amount of aid received.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such limited publication by name might be accompanied, if appropriate, by relevant information about other natural persons benefiting from aid under the EAGF and the EAFRD and the amounts received by them.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The institutions ought thus to have examined, in the course of striking a proper balance between the various interests involved, whether publication by name limited in the manner indicated in paragraph 81 above would have been sufficient to achieve the objectives of the European Union legislation at issue in the main proceedings. In particular, it does not appear that such a limitation, which would protect some of the beneficiaries concerned from interference with their private lives, would not provide citizens with a sufficiently accurate image of the aid granted by the EAGF and the EAFRD to achieve the objectives of that legislation.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States which submitted written observations to the Court and the Council and the Commission refer also to the significant role of the CAP in the European Union budget in order to justify the need for publication laid down by Article 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and by Regulation No\u00a0259/2008.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That argument must be rejected. It is necessary to bear in mind that the institutions are obliged to balance, before disclosing information relating to a natural person, the European Union\u2019s interest in guaranteeing the transparency of its actions and the infringement of the rights recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. No automatic priority can be conferred on the objective of transparency over the right to protection of personal data (see, to that effect, \nCommission \nv \nBavarian Lager\n, paragraphs 75 to 79), even if important economic interests are at stake.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that it does not appear that the institutions properly balanced, on the one hand, the objectives of Article 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and of Regulation No\u00a0259/2008 against, on the other, the rights which natural persons are recognised as having under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. Regard being had to the fact that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (\nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, paragraph 56) and that it is possible to envisage measures which affect less adversely that fundamental right of natural persons and which still contribute effectively to the objectives of the European Union rules in question, it must be held that, by requiring the publication of the names of all natural persons who were beneficiaries of EAGF and EAFRD aid and of the exact amounts received by those persons, the Council and the Commission exceeded the limits which compliance with the principle of proportionality imposes.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, with regard to the legal persons which received EAGF and EAFRD aid, and in so far as they may invoke the rights conferred by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter (see paragraph 53 of the present judgment), the view must be taken that the obligation to publish which follows from the provisions of the European Union rules the validity of which has here been brought into question does not go beyond the limits imposed by compliance with the principle of proportionality. The seriousness of the breach of the right to protection of personal data manifests itself in different ways for, on the one hand, legal persons and, on the other, natural persons. It is necessary to point out in this regard that legal persons are already subject to a more onerous obligation in respect of the publication of data relating to them. Furthermore, the obligation on the competent national authorities to examine, before the data in question are published and for each legal person which is a beneficiary of EAGF or EAFRD aid, whether the name of that person identifies natural persons would impose on those authorities an unreasonable administrative burden (see, to that effect, judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, \nK.U. v.\nFinland\n, 2\u00a0March 2009, application no 2872/02, \u00a7\u00a048, not yet published).\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it must be held that the provisions of European Union law, the validity of which is questioned by the referring court, observe, in so far as they concern the publication of data relating to legal persons, a fair balance in the consideration taken of the respective interests in issue.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the basis of all of the foregoing, Article 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and Regulation No\u00a0259/2008 must be declared invalid to the extent to which, with regard to natural persons who are beneficiaries of EAGF and EAFRD aid, those provisions impose an obligation to publish personal data relating to each beneficiary without drawing a distinction based on relevant criteria such as the periods during which those persons have received such aid, the frequency of such aid or the nature and amount thereof. \nc)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The validity of Article 42(8b) of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 42(8b) of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 authorises the Commission to adopt the detailed rules for the implementation solely of Article 44a of that regulation.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as Article 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 has to be declared invalid for the reasons indicated above, Article 42(8b) of that regulation must be declared invalid in like manner.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the first question and to the first part of the second question is therefore that Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005, and Regulation No\u00a0259/2008, are invalid in so far as, with regard to natural persons who are beneficiaries of EAGF and EAFRD aid, those provisions impose an obligation to publish personal data relating to each beneficiary without drawing a distinction based on relevant criteria such as the periods during which those persons have received such aid, the frequency of such aid or the nature and amount thereof. \nd)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The effects in time of the invalidity which has been established\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where it is justified by overriding considerations of legal certainty, the second paragraph of Article 264\u00a0TFEU, which is also applicable by analogy to a reference under Article 267\u00a0TFEU for a preliminary ruling on the validity of acts of the European Union, confers on the Court a discretion to decide, in each particular case, which specific effects of the act in question must be regarded as definitive (see, to that effect, Case C-333/07 \nRegie Networks\n [2008] ECR I-10807, paragraph 121 and the case-law cited).\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the large number of publications which have taken place in the Member States on the basis of rules which were regarded as being valid, it must be held that the invalidity of the provisions mentioned in paragraph 92 of the present judgment does not allow any action to be brought to challenge the effects of the publication of the lists of beneficiaries of EAGF and EAFRD aid carried out by the national authorities on the basis of those provisions during the period prior to the date on which the present judgment is delivered. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third question\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the referring court seeks, essentially, to ascertain whether the second indent of Article 18(2) of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that the publication of the information resulting from Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and from Regulation No\u00a0259/2008 may be effected only if the personal data protection official has, prior to such publication, kept a full register within the terms of the second indent of Article 18(2). \n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must, in this regard, be borne in mind that Article 18(1) of Directive 95/46 establishes the principle that the supervisory authority must be notified before any wholly or partly automatic operation for the processing of personal data, or any set of such operations intended to serve a single purpose or several related purposes, is carried out. As recital 48 in the preamble to Directive 95/46 explains, \u2018the procedures for notifying the supervisory authority are designed to ensure disclosure of the purposes and main features of any processing operation for the purpose of verification that the operation is in accordance with the national measures taken under this Directive\u2019. \n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second indent of Article 18(2) of Directive 95/46, however, provides that Member States may provide for the simplification of or exemption from that obligation in the case where, inter alia, the controller appoints a personal data protection official. It appears from the decisions for reference that such an appointment was made in the \nLand \nof Hesse so far as concerns the publication of data resulting from Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and from Regulation No\u00a0259/2008. \n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the second indent of Article 18(2) of Directive 95/46, a personal data protection official has a number of tasks which are designed to ensure that processing operations are unlikely to have an adverse effect on the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned. The official is thus responsible for, among other things, \u2018keeping the register of processing operations carried out by the controller, containing the items of information referred to in Article 21(2) [of Directive 95/46]\u2019. The latter provision refers to Article 19(1)(a) to (e) of Directive 95/46.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, contrary to the view expressed by the referring court, the second indent of Article 18(2) of Directive 95/46 does not require any provision to be adopted which imposes an obligation on the personal data protection official to maintain a register containing the information referred to in Article 21(2) of that directive, read in conjunction with Article 19(1)(a) to (e) thereof, before the processing of the data concerned is undertaken. The register referred to in the second indent of Article 18(2) of Directive 95/46 need contain only \u2018processing operations carried out\u2019. \n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the absence, established by the referring court, of a full register prior to the data processing cannot affect the legality of a publication such as that resulting from Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and from Regulation No\u00a0259/2008.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the third question is therefore that the second indent of Article 18(2) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as not placing the personal data protection official under an obligation to keep the register provided for by that provision before an operation for the processing of personal data, such as that resulting from Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and from Regulation No\u00a0259/2008, is carried out.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fourth question\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, the referring court seeks, essentially, to ascertain whether Article 20 of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as making the publication of the information resulting from Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and from Regulation No\u00a0259/2008 subject to the prior checks for which that Article 20 provides. \n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must first be pointed out that Article 20(1) of Directive 95/46 provides that \u2018Member States shall determine the processing operations likely to present specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects and shall check that these processing operations are examined prior to the start thereof\u2019.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that Directive 95/46 does not make the processing of personal data subject, in general, to a prior check. As is clear from recital 52 in the preamble to Directive 95/46, the European Union legislature took the view that \u2018\nex post facto\n verification by the competent authorities must in general be considered a sufficient measure\u2019.\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to processing operations which are subject to prior checks, that is to say, processing operations which are likely to pose specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, recital 53 in the preamble to Directive 95/46 states that processing operations are likely to pose such risks \u2018by virtue of their nature, their scope or their purposes\u2019. Even though Member States have the option of specifying in greater detail in their legislation the processing operations which may pose specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, Directive 95/46 provides, as is evident from recital 54 in its preamble, that the number of such operations \u2018should be very limited\u2019. \n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must further be pointed out that, under Article 27(1) of Regulation No\u00a045/2001, processing operations which are likely to present specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects are also subject to prior checking when carried out by institutions and bodies of the European Union. Article 27(2) of that regulation specifies the operations which are likely to present such risks. In view of the parallel relationship between the provisions of Directive 95/46 and those of Regulation No\u00a045/2001 which relate to prior checks, the listing in Article 27(2) of Regulation No\u00a045/2001 of the processing operations which are likely to present specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects must be considered relevant for the purpose of interpreting Article 20 of Directive 95/46.\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it does not appear that the publication of the data imposed by Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and by Regulation No\u00a0259/2008 comes within any of the categories of processing operations covered by Article 27(2) of Regulation No\u00a045/2001.\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the answer to the fourth question is that Article 20 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as not imposing an obligation on the Member States to make the publication of information resulting from Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 and from Regulation No\u00a0259/2008 subject to the prior checks for which that Article 20 provides.\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the answer to the fourth question, there is no longer any need to answer the fifth question.\nIV \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\nCosts\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the actions pending before the national court, the decisions on costs are a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticles 42(8b) and 44a of Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01290/2005 of 21\u00a0June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No\u00a01437/2007 of 26\u00a0November 2007, and Commission Regulation (EC) No 259/2008 of 18\u00a0March 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005 as regards the publication of information on the beneficiaries of funds deriving from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) are invalid in so far as, with regard to natural persons who are beneficiaries of EAGF and EAFRD aid, those provisions impose an obligation to publish personal data relating to each beneficiary without drawing a distinction based on relevant criteria such as the periods during which those persons have received such aid, the frequency of such aid or the nature and amount thereof.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe invalidity of the provisions of European Union law mentioned in paragraph 1 of this operative part does not allow any action to be brought to challenge the effects of the publication of the lists of beneficiaries of EAGF and EAFRD aid carried out by the national authorities on the basis of those provisions during the period prior to the date on which the present judgment is delivered.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe second indent of Article 18(2) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as not placing the personal data protection official under an obligation to keep the register provided for by that provision before an operation for the processing of personal data, such as that resulting from Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005, as amended by Regulation No\u00a01437/2007, and from Regulation No\u00a0259/2008, is carried out.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle 20 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as not imposing an obligation on the Member States to make the publication of information resulting from Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No\u00a01290/2005, as amended by Regulation No\u00a01437/2007, and from Regulation No\u00a0259/2008 subject to the prior checks for which that Article 20 provides."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 6 Oct 2020, C-511/18 (\nLa Quadrature du Net and others\n)\nCharter of

Consequently, this Directive does not affect the ability of Member States to carry out lawful interception of electronic communications, or take other measures, if necessary for any of these purposes and in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, [signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950,] as interpreted by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.

That technique is intended only to facilitate the collection, for a limited period and from all of the connection data processed by those operators and service providers, of such data as might be related to a serious offence of this kind. In those circumstances, those provisions, which do not impose a general obligation of active surveillance, do not, in the view of the referring court, infringe Article\u00a015 of Directive 2000/31.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the pleas alleging infringement of Directive 2002/58, the referring court considers that it follows, inter alia, from the provisions of that directive and from the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970; \u2018\nTele2\n\u2019), that national provisions imposing obligations on providers of electronic communications services, such as the general and indiscriminate retention of the traffic and location data of their users and subscribers, for the purposes stated in Article\u00a015(1) of that directive, which include safeguarding national security, defence and public security, fall within the scope of that directive since those rules govern the activity of those providers. That also applies to rules governing access to and use of data by national authorities.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court concludes from this that both the obligation to retain data resulting from Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-1 of the CSI and the access of the administrative authorities to that data, including real-time access, provided for in Articles\u00a0L.\u00a0851-1, L.\u00a0851-2 and L.\u00a0851-4 of that code, fall within the scope of Directive 2002/58. The same is true, according to that court, of the provisions of Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-3 of the CSI, which, although they do not impose a general retention obligation on the operators concerned, do however require them to implement automated processing on their networks that is intended to detect links that might constitute a terrorist threat.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the referring court takes the view that the scope of Directive 2002/58 does not extend to the provisions of the CSI referred to in the applications for annulment which relate to intelligence gathering techniques applied directly by the State, but do not regulate the activities of providers of electronic communications services by imposing specific obligations on them. Accordingly, those provisions cannot be regarded as implementing EU law, with the result that the pleas alleging that they infringe Directive 2002/58 cannot validly be relied on.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, with a view to settling the disputes concerning the lawfulness of Decrees No\u00a02015-1185, No\u00a02015-1211, No\u00a02015-1639 and No\u00a02016-67 in the light of Directive 2002/58, in so far as they were adopted to implement Articles\u00a0L.\u00a0851-1 to L.\u00a0851-4 of the CSI, three questions on the interpretation of EU law arise.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the interpretation of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, the referring court is uncertain, in the first place, whether a general and indiscriminate retention obligation, imposed on providers of electronic communications services on the basis of Articles\u00a0L.\u00a0851-1 and R.\u00a0851-5 of the CSI, is to be regarded in the light, inter alia, of the safeguards and checks to which the access of the administrative authorities to and the use of connection data are subject, as interference justified by the right to security guaranteed in Article\u00a06 of the Charter and by the requirements of national security, responsibility for which falls to the Member States alone pursuant to Article\u00a04 TEU.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the second place, the other obligations which may be imposed on providers of electronic communications services, the referring court states that the provisions of Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-2 of the CSI permit, for the sole purpose of preventing terrorism, the collection of the information or documents referred to in Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-1 of that code from the same persons. Such collection, in relation solely to one or more individuals previously identified as potentially having links to a terrorist threat, is to be carried out in real time. The same is true of the provisions of Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-4, which authorise the real-time transmission by operators exclusively of technical data relating to the location of terminal equipment. Those techniques regulate the real-time access of the administrative authorities to data retained under the CPCE and the LCEN for various purposes and by various means, without, however, imposing on the providers concerned any additional retention requirement over and above what is necessary for the billing and provision of their services. In the same vein, nor do the provisions of Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-3 of the CSI, which require service providers to implement on their networks an automated system for the analysis of connections, entail general and indiscriminate retention.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court considers that both general and indiscriminate retention and real-time access to connection data are of unparalleled operational usefulness, against a background of serious and persistent threats to national security, in particular the terrorist threat. General and indiscriminate retention allows the intelligence services to obtain access to communications data before the reasons for believing that the person concerned poses a threat to public security, defence or State security are identified. In addition, real-time access to connection data makes it possible to monitor, with a high level of responsiveness, the conduct of individuals who may pose an immediate threat to public order.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the technique provided for in Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-3 of the CSI makes it possible to detect, on the basis of criteria specifically defined for that purpose, those individuals whose conduct may, in view of their methods of communication, constitute a terrorist threat.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, as regards access by the competent authorities to retained data, the referring court is unsure whether Directive 2002/58, read in the light of the Charter, is to be interpreted as meaning that it is a prerequisite for the lawfulness of the procedures for the collection of connection data that the data subjects are informed whenever their being so informed is no longer liable to jeopardise the investigations being undertaken by the competent authorities, or whether such procedures may be regarded as lawful taking into account all the other procedural safeguards provided for in national law where those safeguards ensure that the right to a remedy is effective.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards those other procedural safeguards, the referring court states in particular that any person wishing to verify that no intelligence techniques have been unlawfully implemented against him or her may bring the matter before a specialist panel of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State, France), which is responsible for determining\u00a0\u2013 in the light of the information communicated to it outside \ninter partes\n proceedings\u00a0\u2013 whether the applicant has been the subject of an intelligence technique and whether that technique was implemented in accordance with Book\u00a0VIII of the CSI. The powers conferred on that panel to investigate applications ensure that the judicial review conducted by it is effective. Thus, it has jurisdiction to investigate applications, to raise of its own motion any illegalities it may find and to order the authorities to take all appropriate measures to remedy the illegalities found. In addition, it is for the Commission for the Oversight of Intelligence Techniques to check that intelligence gathering techniques are implemented, on national territory, in accordance with the requirements flowing from the CSI. Thus, the fact that the legislative provisions at issue in the main proceedings do not provide for the notification to the persons concerned of the surveillance measures applied to them does not, in itself, constitute excessive interference with the right to respect for private life.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is on that basis that the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State, France) decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the general and indiscriminate retention obligation imposed on providers on the basis of the implementing provisions of Article\u00a015(1) of [Directive 2002/58] to be regarded, against a background of serious and persistent threats to national security, and in particular the terrorist threat, as interference justified by the right to security guaranteed in Article\u00a06 of the [Charter] and the requirements of national security, responsibility for which falls to the Member States alone pursuant to Article\u00a04 [TEU]?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is [Directive 2002/58], read in the light of the [Charter], to be interpreted as authorising legislative measures, such as the measures for the real-time collection of the traffic and location data of specified individuals, which, whilst affecting the rights and obligations of the providers of an electronic communications service, do not however require them to comply with a specific obligation to retain their data?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is [Directive 2002/58], read in the light of the [Charter], to be interpreted as meaning that it is a prerequisite for the lawfulness of the procedures for the collection of connection data that the data subjects are informed whenever their being so informed is no longer liable to jeopardise the investigations being undertaken by the competent authorities, or may such procedures be regarded as lawful taking into account all the other existing procedural safeguards where those safeguards ensure that the right to a remedy is effective?\u2019\n\u00a0\nCase C\n-\n512/18\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By application lodged on 1\u00a0September 2015, French Data Network, La Quadrature du Net and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des fournisseurs d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet associatifs brought an action before the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State, France) for the annulment of the implied rejection decision arising from the Prime Minister\u2019s failure to reply to their application for the repeal of Article\u00a0R.\u00a010-13 of the CPCE and Decree No\u00a02011-219, on the ground, inter alia, that those legislative texts infringe Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 of the Charter. Privacy International and the Center for Democracy and Technology were granted leave to intervene in the main proceedings.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards Article\u00a0R.\u00a010-13 of the CPCE and the obligation of general and indiscriminate retention of communications data laid down therein, the referring court, which raises similar considerations to those in Case C-511/18, observes that such retention allows a judicial authority to access data relating to communications made by an individual before being suspected of having committed a criminal offence, with the result that such retention is of unparalleled usefulness for the investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards Decree No\u00a02011-219, the referring court considers that Article\u00a06(II) of the LCEN, which imposes an obligation to hold and retain only data relating to the creation of content, does not fall within the scope of Directive 2002/58 since that directive\u2019s scope is limited, in accordance with Article\u00a03(1) thereof, to the provision of publicly available electronic communications services in public communications networks in the European Union. On the other hand, that national provision does fall within the scope of Directive 2000/31.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court considers, however, that it follows from Article\u00a015(1) and (2) of Directive 2000/31 that the directive does not establish a prohibition in principle on retaining data relating to the creation of content, from which derogation would be possible only by way of exception. Thus, the question arises whether Articles\u00a012, 14 and 15 of Directive 2000/31, read in the light of Articles\u00a06, 7, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, are to be interpreted as allowing a Member State to introduce national legislation, such as Article\u00a06(II) of the LCEN, which requires the persons concerned to retain data capable of enabling the identification of anyone who has contributed to the creation of the content or some of the content of the services which they provide, so that a judicial authority may, where appropriate, require the communication of that data with a view to ensuring compliance with the rules on civil and criminal liability.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is on that basis that the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State, France) decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the general and indiscriminate retention obligation imposed on providers on the basis of the implementing provisions of Article\u00a015(1) of [Directive 2002/58] to be regarded, inter alia in the light of the safeguards and checks to which the collection and use of such connection data are then subject, as interference justified by the right to security guaranteed in Article\u00a06 of the [Charter] and the requirements of national security, responsibility for which falls to the Member States alone pursuant to Article\u00a04 [TEU]?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are the provisions of [Directive 2000/31], read in the light of Articles\u00a06, 7, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the [Charter], to be interpreted as allowing a State to introduce national legislation requiring the persons, whose activity consists in offering access to online public communications services and the natural or legal persons who, even free of charge, and for provision to the public via online public communications services, store signals, writing, images, sounds or messages of any kind provided by recipients of those services, to retain the data capable of enabling the identification of anyone who has contributed to the creation of the content or some of the content of the services which they provide, so that a judicial authority may, where appropriate, require the communication of that data with a view to ensuring compliance with the rules on civil and criminal liability?\u2019\n\u00a0\nCase C\n-\n520/18\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By applications lodged on 10, 16, 17 and 18\u00a0January 2017, joined in the main proceedings, the Ordre des barreaux francophones et germanophone, the Acad\u00e9mie Fiscale ASBL and UA, the Liga voor Mensenrechten ASBL, the Ligue des Droits de l\u2019Homme ASBL, and VZ, WY and XX brought actions before the Cour constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court, Belgium) for the annulment of the Law of 29\u00a0May 2016, on the ground that it infringes Articles\u00a010 and 11 of the Belgian Constitution, read in conjunction with Articles\u00a05, 6 to 11, 14, 15, 17 and 18 of the ECHR, Articles\u00a07, 8, 11 and 47 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, Article\u00a017 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 16\u00a0December 1966 and entered into force on 23\u00a0March 1976, the general principles of legal certainty, proportionality and self-determination in relation to information and Article\u00a05(4) TEU.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In support of their actions, the applicants in the main proceedings submit, in essence, that the Law of 29\u00a0May 2016 is unlawful because, among other things, it goes beyond what is strictly necessary and does not lay down adequate guarantees of protection. In particular, neither its provisions relating to the retention of data nor those governing access by the authorities to retained data satisfy the requirements deriving from the judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n (C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238; \u2018\nDigital Rights\n\u2019) and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970). They contend that those provisions entail a risk that personality profiles will be compiled, which may be misused by the competent authorities, and that they do not establish an appropriate level of security and protection for the retained data. Lastly, that law covers persons who are bound by professional secrecy and persons who are under a duty of confidentiality, and applies to personal communication data that is sensitive, without including specific safeguards to protect such data.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court observes that the data which must be retained by providers of telephony services, including via the Internet, Internet access and Internet-based email and by operators providing public electronic communications networks, under the Law of 29\u00a0May 2016, is identical to that listed in Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\u00a0March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC (OJ 2006 L\u00a0105, p.\u00a054), without any distinction being made as regards the persons concerned or on the basis of the objective pursued. As regards the latter point, the referring court states that the objective pursued by the legislature by means of that law is not only to combat terrorism and child pornography, but also to enable the use of the retained data in a wide variety of situations in the context of criminal investigations. The referring court also notes that it is apparent from the explanatory memorandum for that law that the national legislature considered it impossible, in the light of the objective pursued, to impose a targeted and selective obligation to retain data, and that it chose to apply strict guarantees to the general and indiscriminate retention obligation, both as regards the data retained and access to that data, in order to keep interference with the right to respect for private life to a minimum.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court also states that subparagraphs\u00a01 and 2 of Article\u00a0126(2) of the Law of 13\u00a0June 2005, as amended by the Law of 29\u00a0May 2016, lay down the conditions under which, respectively, judicial authorities and the intelligence and security services may obtain access to retained data, and consequently the review of the lawfulness of that law in the light of the requirements of EU law should be deferred until the Court has adjudicated on two preliminary ruling procedures pending before it concerning such access.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, the referring court states that the Law of 29\u00a0May 2016 seeks to ensure an effective criminal investigation and effective penalties in cases involving the sexual abuse of minors and to make it possible to identify the perpetrator of such an offence, even where electronic communications systems are used. In the proceedings before it, attention was drawn in that respect to the positive obligations under Articles\u00a03 and 8 of the ECHR. Those obligations may also arise under the corresponding provisions of the Charter, which may have consequences for the interpretation of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is on that basis that the Cour constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court, Belgium) decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article\u00a015(1) of [Directive 2002/58], read in conjunction with the right to security, guaranteed by Article\u00a06 of the [Charter], and the right to respect for personal data, as guaranteed by Articles\u00a07, 8 and 52(1) of the [Charter], be interpreted as precluding national legislation such as that at issue, which lays down a general obligation for operators and providers of electronic communications services to retain the traffic and location data within the meaning of [Directive 2002/58], generated or processed by them in the context of the supply of those services, national legislation whose objective is not only the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious criminal offences but also the safeguarding of national security, the defence of the territory and of public security, the investigation, detection and prosecution of offences other than serious crime or the prevention of the prohibited use of electronic communication systems, or the attainment of another objective identified by Article\u00a023(1) of [Regulation 2016/679] and which, furthermore, is subject to specific safeguards in that legislation in terms of data retention and access to that data?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article\u00a015(1) of [Directive 2002/58], in conjunction with Articles\u00a04, 7, 8, 11 and 52(1) of the [Charter], be interpreted as precluding national legislation such as that at issue, which lays down a general obligation for operators and providers of electronic communications services to retain the traffic and location data within the meaning of [Directive 2002/58], generated or processed by them in the context of the supply of those services, if the object of that legislation is, in particular, to comply with the positive obligations borne by the authority under Articles\u00a04 and [7] of the Charter, consisting in the provision of a legal framework which allows the effective criminal investigation and the effective punishment of sexual abuse of minors and which permits the effective identification of the perpetrator of the offence, even where electronic communications systems are used?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, on the basis of the answer to the first or the second question, the Cour constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court, Belgium) should conclude that the contested law fails to fulfil one or more obligations arising under the provisions referred to in these questions, might it maintain on a temporary basis the effects of [the Law of 29\u00a0May 2016] in order to avoid legal uncertainty and to enable the data previously collected and retained to continue to be used for the objectives pursued by the law?\u2019\n\u00a0\nProcedure before the Court\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of the President of the Court of 25\u00a0September 2018, Cases C-511/18 and C-512/18 were joined for the purposes of the written and oral parts of the procedure and the judgment. Case C-520/18 was joined to those cases by decision of the President of the Court of 9\u00a0July 2020 for the purposes of the judgment.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nQuestion\n\u00a0\n1 in Cases C\n-\n511/18 and C\n-\n512/18 and questions\n\u00a0\n1 and 2 in Case C\n-\n520/18\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By question\u00a01 in Cases C-511/18 and C-512/18 and questions\u00a01 and 2 in Case C-520/18, which should be considered together, the referring courts essentially ask whether Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which imposes on providers of electronic communications services, for the purposes set out in Article\u00a015(1), an obligation requiring the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data.\n\u00a0\nPreliminary remarks\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the documents available to the Court that the legislation at issue in the main proceedings covers all electronic communications systems and applies to all users of such systems, without distinction or exception. Furthermore, the data which must be retained by providers of electronic communications services under that legislation is, in particular, the data necessary for locating the source of a communication and its destination, for determining the date, time, duration and type of communication, for identifying the communications equipment used, and for locating the terminal equipment and communications, data which comprises, inter alia, the name and address of the user, the telephone numbers of the caller and the person called, and the IP address for Internet services. By contrast, that data does not cover the content of the communications concerned.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the data which must, under the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, be retained for a period of one year makes it possible, inter alia, to identify the person with whom the user of an electronic communications system has communicated and by what means, to determine the date, time and duration of the communications and Internet connections and the place from which those communications and connections took place, and to ascertain the location of the terminal equipment without any communication necessarily having been transmitted. In addition, that data enables the frequency of a user\u2019s communications with certain persons over a given period of time to be established. Last, as regards the national legislation at issue in Cases C-511/18 and C-512/18, it appears that that legislation, in so far as it also covers data relating to the conveyance of electronic communications by networks, also enables the nature of the information consulted online to be identified.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the aims pursued, it should be noted that the legislation at issue in Cases C-511/18 and C-512/18 pursues, among other aims, the investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences in general; national independence, territorial integrity and national defence; major foreign policy interests; the implementation of France\u2019s European and international commitments; France\u2019s major economic, industrial and scientific interests; and the prevention of terrorism, attacks against the republican nature of the institutions and collective violence liable to cause serious disruption to the maintenance of law and order. The objectives of the legislation at issue in Case C-520/18 are, inter alia, the investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences and the safeguarding of national security, the defence of the territory and public security.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring courts are uncertain, in particular, as to the possible impact of the right to security enshrined in Article\u00a06 of the Charter on the interpretation of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58. Similarly, they ask whether the interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter entailed by the retention of data provided for in the legislation at issue in the main proceedings may, in the light of the existence of rules restricting national authorities\u2019 access to retained data, be regarded as justified. In addition, according to the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State, France), since that question arises in a context characterised by serious and persistent threats to national security, it should also be assessed in the light of Article\u00a04(2) TEU. The Cour constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court, Belgium), for its part, points out that the national legislation at issue in Case C-520/18 also implements positive obligations flowing from Articles\u00a04 and 7 of the Charter, consisting in the establishment of a legal framework for the effective prevention and punishment of the sexual abuse of minors.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While both the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State, France) and the Cour constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court, Belgium) start from the premiss that the respective national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, which governs the retention of traffic and location data and access to that data by national authorities for the purposes set out in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, such as safeguarding national security, falls within the scope of that directive, a number of parties to the main proceedings and some of the Member States which submitted written observations to the Court disagree on that point, particularly concerning the interpretation of Article\u00a01(3) of that directive. It is therefore necessary to examine, first of all, whether the legislation at issue falls within the scope of that directive.\n\u00a0\nScope of Directive 2002/58\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La Quadrature du Net, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des fournisseurs d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet associatifs, Igwan.net, Privacy International and the Center for Democracy and Technology rely on the Court\u2019s case-law on the scope of Directive 2002/58 to argue, in essence, that both the retention of data and access to retained data fall within that scope, whether that access takes place in non-real time or in real time. Indeed, they contend that since the objective of safeguarding national security is expressly mentioned in Article\u00a015(1) of that directive, the pursuit of that objective does not render that directive inapplicable. In their view, Article\u00a04(2) TEU, mentioned by the referring courts, does not affect that assessment.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the intelligence measures implemented directly by the competent French authorities, without regulating the activities of providers of electronic communications services by imposing specific obligations on them, the Center for Democracy and Technology observes that those measures necessarily fall within the scope of Directive 2002/58 and of the Charter, since they are exceptions to the principle of confidentiality guaranteed in Article\u00a05 of that directive. Those measures must therefore comply with the requirements stemming from Article\u00a015(1) of the directive.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the Czech and Estonian Governments, Ireland, and the French, Cypriot, Hungarian, Polish, Swedish and United Kingdom Governments submit, in essence, that Directive 2002/58 does not apply to national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, since the purpose of that legislation is to safeguard national security. The intelligence services\u2019 activities, in so far as they relate to the maintenance of public order and to the safeguarding of internal security and territorial integrity, are part of the essential functions of the Member States and, consequently, are within their exclusive competence, as evidenced, in particular, by the third sentence of Article\u00a04(2) TEU.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those governments and Ireland also refer to Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58, which excludes from the scope of that directive, as the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 did in the past, activities concerning public security, defence and State security. They rely in that regard on the interpretation of the latter provision set out in the judgment of 30\u00a0May 2006, \nParliament\n v \nCouncil and Commission\n (C-317/04 and C-318/04, EU:C:2006:346).\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be stated that, under Article\u00a01(1) thereof, Directive 2002/58 provides, inter alia, for the harmonisation of the national provisions required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy and confidentiality, with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01(3) of that directive excludes from its scope \u2018activities of the State\u2019 in specified fields, including activities of the State in areas of criminal law and in the areas of public security, defence and State security, including the economic well-being of the State when the activities relate to State security matters. The activities thus mentioned by way of example are, in any event, activities of the State or of State authorities and are unrelated to fields in which individuals are active (judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraph\u00a032 and the case-law cited).\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Article\u00a03 of Directive 2002/58 states that that directive is to apply to the processing of personal data in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services in public communications networks in the European Union, including public communications networks supporting data collection and identification devices (\u2018electronic communications services\u2019). Consequently, that directive must be regarded as regulating the activities of the providers of such services (judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraph\u00a033 and the case-law cited).\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 states that Member States may adopt, subject to the conditions laid down, \u2018legislative measures to restrict the scope of the rights and obligations provided for in Article\u00a05, Article\u00a06, Article\u00a08(1), (2), (3) and (4), and Article\u00a09 of [that directive]\u2019 (judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a071).\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 necessarily presupposes that the national legislative measures referred to therein fall within the scope of that directive, since it expressly authorises the Member States to adopt them only if the conditions laid down in the directive are met. Further, such measures regulate, for the purposes mentioned in that provision, the activity of providers of electronic communications services (judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraph\u00a034 and the case-law cited).\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is in the light of, inter alia, those considerations that the Court has held that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a03 thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that the scope of that directive extends not only to a legislative measure that requires providers of electronic communications services to retain traffic and location data, but also to a legislative measure requiring them to grant the competent national authorities access to that data. Such legislative measures necessarily involve the processing, by those providers, of the data and cannot, to the extent that they regulate the activities of those providers, be regarded as activities characteristic of States, referred to in Article\u00a01(3) of that directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraphs\u00a035 and 37 and the case-law cited).\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, having regard to the considerations set out in paragraph\u00a095 above and the general scheme of Directive 2002/58, an interpretation of that directive under which the legislative measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) thereof were excluded from the scope of that directive because the objectives which such measures must pursue overlap substantially with the objectives pursued by the activities referred to in Article\u00a01(3) of that same directive would deprive Article\u00a015(1) thereof of any practical effect (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraphs\u00a072 and 73).\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concept of \u2018activities\u2019 referred to in Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58 cannot therefore, as was noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in point\u00a075 of his Opinion in Joined Cases \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18 and C-512/18, EU:C:2020:6), be interpreted as covering the legislative measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of that directive.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04(2) TEU, to which the governments listed in paragraph\u00a089 of the present judgment have made reference, cannot invalidate that conclusion. Indeed, according to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, although it is for the Member States to define their essential security interests and to adopt appropriate measures to ensure their internal and external security, the mere fact that a national measure has been taken for the purpose of protecting national security cannot render EU law inapplicable and exempt the Member States from their obligation to comply with that law (see, to that effect, judgments of 4\u00a0June 2013, \nZZ\n, C-300/11, EU:C:2013:363, paragraph\u00a038; of 20\u00a0March 2018, \nCommission\n v \nAustria (State printing office)\n, C-187/16, EU:C:2018:194, paragraphs\u00a075 and 76; and of 2\u00a0April 2020, \nCommission\n v \nPoland, Hungary and Czech Republic (Temporary mechanism for the relocation of applicants for international protection)\n, C-715/17, C-718/17 and C-719/17, EU:C:2020:257, paragraphs\u00a0143 and 170).\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, in the judgment of 30\u00a0May 2006, \nParliament\n v \nCouncil and Commission\n (C-317/04 and C-318/04, EU:C:2006:346, paragraphs\u00a056 to 59), the Court held that the transfer of personal data by airlines to the public authorities of a third country for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorism and other serious crimes did not, pursuant to the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, fall within the scope of that directive, because that transfer fell within a framework established by the public authorities relating to public security.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, having regard to the considerations set out in paragraphs\u00a093, 95 and 96 of the present judgment, that case-law cannot be transposed to the interpretation of Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58. Indeed, as the Advocate General noted, in essence, in points\u00a070 to 72 of his Opinion in Joined Cases \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18 and C-512/18, EU:C:2020:6), the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, to which that case-law relates, excluded, in a general way, from the scope of that directive \u2018processing operations concerning public security, defence, [and] State security\u2019, without drawing any distinction according to who was carrying out the data processing operation concerned. By contrast, in the context of interpreting Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58, it is necessary to draw such a distinction. As is apparent from paragraphs\u00a094 to 97 of the present judgment, all operations processing personal data carried out by providers of electronic communications services fall within the scope of that directive, including processing operations resulting from obligations imposed on those providers by the public authorities, although those processing operations could, where appropriate, on the contrary, fall within the scope of the exception laid down in the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, given the broader wording of that provision, which covers all processing operations concerning public security, defence, or State security, regardless of the person carrying out those operations.\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it should be noted that Directive 95/46, which was at issue in the case that gave rise to the judgment of 30\u00a0May 2006, \nParliament \nv \nCouncil and Commission\n (C-317/04 and C-318/04, EU:C:2006:346), has been, pursuant to Article\u00a094(1) of Regulation 2016/679, repealed and replaced by that regulation with effect from 25\u00a0May 2018. Although that regulation states, in Article\u00a02(2)(d) thereof, that it does not apply to processing operations carried out \u2018by competent authorities\u2019 for the purposes of, inter alia, the prevention and detection of criminal offences, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, it is apparent from Article\u00a023(1)(d) and (h) of that regulation that the processing of personal data carried out by individuals for those same purposes falls within the scope of that regulation. It follows that the above interpretation of Article\u00a01(3), Article\u00a03 and Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 is consistent with the definition of the scope of Regulation 2016/679, which is supplemented and specified by that directive.\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, where the Member States directly implement measures that derogate from the rule that electronic communications are to be confidential, without imposing processing obligations on providers of electronic communications services, the protection of the data of the persons concerned is covered not by Directive 2002/58, but by national law only, subject to the application of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (OJ 2016 L\u00a0119, p.\u00a089), with the result that the measures in question must comply with, inter alia, national constitutional law and the requirements of the ECHR.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing considerations that national legislation which requires providers of electronic communications services to retain traffic and location data for the purposes of protecting national security and combating crime, such as the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, falls within the scope of Directive 2002/58.\n\u00a0\nInterpretation of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted, as a preliminary point, that it is settled case-law that, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary not only to refer to its wording but also to consider its context and the objectives of the legislation of which it forms part, and in particular the origin of that legislation (see, to that effect, judgment of 17\u00a0April 2018, \nEgenberger\n, C-414/16, EU:C:2018:257, paragraph\u00a044).\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from, inter alia, recitals\u00a06 and 7 thereof, the purpose of Directive 2002/58 is to protect users of electronic communications services from risks for their personal data and privacy resulting from new technologies and, in particular, from the increasing capacity for automated storage and processing of data. In particular, that directive seeks, as is stated in recital\u00a02 thereof, to ensure that the rights set out in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter are fully respected. In that regard, it is apparent from the Explanatory Memorandum of the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (COM (2000) 385 final), which gave rise to Directive 2002/58, that the EU legislature sought to \u2018ensure that a high level of protection of personal data and privacy will continue to be guaranteed for all electronic communications services regardless of the technology used\u2019.\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2002/58 enshrines the principle of confidentiality of both electronic communications and the related traffic data and requires, inter alia, that, in principle, persons other than users be prohibited from storing, without those users\u2019 consent, those communications and that data.\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in particular, the processing and storage of traffic data by providers of electronic communications services, it is apparent from Article\u00a06 and recitals\u00a022 and 26 of Directive 2002/58 that such processing is permitted only to the extent necessary and for the time necessary for the marketing and billing of services and the provision of value added services. Once that period has elapsed, the data that has been processed and stored must be erased or made anonymous. As regards location data other than traffic data, Article\u00a09(1) of that directive provides that that data may be processed only subject to certain conditions and after it has been made anonymous or the consent of the users or subscribers has been obtained (judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a086 and the case-law cited).\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in adopting that directive, the EU legislature gave concrete expression to the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, so that the users of electronic communications services are entitled to expect, in principle, that their communications and data relating thereto will remain anonymous and may not be recorded, unless they have agreed otherwise.\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 enables the Member States to introduce exceptions to the obligation of principle, laid down in Article\u00a05(1) of that directive, to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, and to the corresponding obligations, referred to, inter alia, in Articles\u00a06 and 9 of that directive, where such a restriction constitutes a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society to safeguard national security, defence and public security, and the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of unauthorised use of the electronic communication system. To that end, Member States may, inter alia, adopt legislative measures providing for the retention of data for a limited period justified on one of those grounds.\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being said, the option to derogate from the rights and obligations laid down in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58 cannot permit the exception to the obligation of principle to ensure the confidentiality of electronic communications and data relating thereto and, in particular, to the prohibition on storage of that data, explicitly laid down in Article\u00a05 of that directive, to become the rule (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraphs\u00a089 and 104).\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objectives that are capable of justifying a limitation of the rights and obligations laid down, in particular, in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58, the Court has previously held that the list of objectives set out in the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of that directive is exhaustive, as a result of which a legislative measure adopted under that provision must correspond, genuinely and strictly, to one of those objectives (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraph\u00a052 and the case-law cited).\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it is apparent from the third sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 that the Member States are not permitted to adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope of the rights and obligations provided for in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of that directive unless they do so in accordance with the general principles of EU law, including the principle of proportionality, and with the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In that regard, the Court has previously held that the obligation imposed on providers of electronic communications services by a Member State by way of national legislation to retain traffic data for the purpose of making them available, if necessary, to the competent national authorities raises issues relating to compatibility not only with Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, relating to the protection of privacy and to the protection of personal data, respectively, but also with Article\u00a011 of the Charter, relating to the freedom of expression (see, to that effect, judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraphs\u00a025 and 70, and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraphs\u00a091and 92 and the case-law cited).\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the interpretation of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 must take account of the importance both of the right to privacy, guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, and of the right to protection of personal data, guaranteed in Article\u00a08 thereof, as derived from the case-law of the Court, as well as the importance of the right to freedom of expression, given that that fundamental right, guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter, constitutes one of the essential foundations of a pluralist, democratic society, and is one of the values on which, under Article\u00a02 TEU, the Union is founded (see, to that effect, judgments of 6\u00a0March 2001, \nConnolly\n v \nCommission\n, C-274/99\u00a0P, EU:C:2001:127, paragraph\u00a039, and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a093 and the case-law cited).\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be made clear, in that regard, that the retention of traffic and location data constitutes, in itself, on the one hand, a derogation from the prohibition laid down in Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2002/58 barring any person other than the users from storing that data, and, on the other, an interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and the protection of personal data, enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, irrespective of whether the information in question relating to private life is sensitive or whether the persons concerned have been inconvenienced in any way on account of that interference (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0124 and 126 and the case-law cited; see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a08 of the ECHR, ECtHR, 30\u00a0January 2020, \nBreyer v. Germany\n, CE:ECHR:2020:0130JUD005000112, \u00a7\u00a081).\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether or not the retained data has been used subsequently is also irrelevant (see, by analogy, as regards Article\u00a08 of the ECHR, ECtHR, 16\u00a0February 2000, \nAmann v. Switzerland\n, CE:ECHR:2000:0216JUD002779895, \u00a7\u00a069, and 13\u00a0February 2020, \nTrajkovski and Chipovski v. North Macedonia\n, CE:ECHR:2020:0213JUD005320513, \u00a7\u00a051), since access to such data is a separate interference with the fundamental rights referred to in the preceding paragraph, irrespective of the subsequent use made of it (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0124 and 126).\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion is all the more justified since traffic and location data may reveal information on a significant number of aspects of the private life of the persons concerned, including sensitive information such as sexual orientation, political opinions, religious, philosophical, societal or other beliefs and state of health, given that such data moreover enjoys special protection under EU law. Taken as a whole, that data may allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data has been retained, such as the habits of everyday life, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social relationships of those persons and the social environments frequented by them. In particular, that data provides the means of establishing a profile of the individuals concerned, information that is no less sensitive, having regard to the right to privacy, than the actual content of communications (see, to that effect, judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a027, and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a099).\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, first, the retention of traffic and location data for policing purposes is liable, in itself, to infringe the right to respect for communications, enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, and to deter users of electronic communications systems from exercising their freedom of expression, guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a028, and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0101). Such deterrence may affect, in particular, persons whose communications are subject, according to national rules, to the obligation of professional secrecy and whistleblowers whose actions are protected by Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23\u00a0October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law (OJ 2019 L\u00a0305, p.\u00a017). Moreover, that deterrent effect is all the more serious given the quantity and breadth of data retained.\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, in view of the significant quantity of traffic and location data that may be continuously retained under a general and indiscriminate retention measure, as well as the sensitive nature of the information that may be gleaned from that data, the mere retention of such data by providers of electronic communications services entails a risk of abuse and unlawful access.\n120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being said, in so far as Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 allows Member States to introduce the derogations referred to in paragraph\u00a0110 above, that provision reflects the fact that the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 of the Charter are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0172 and the case-law cited).\n121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, as can be seen from Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, that provision allows limitations to be placed on the exercise of those rights, provided that those limitations are provided for by law, that they respect the essence of those rights and that, in compliance with the principle of proportionality, they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.\n122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in order to interpret Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 in the light of the Charter, account must also be taken of the importance of the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a03, 4, 6 and 7 of the Charter and of the importance of the objectives of protecting national security and combating serious crime in contributing to the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\n123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Article\u00a06 of the Charter, to which the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State, France) and the Cour constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court, Belgium) refer, lays down the right of every individual not only to liberty but also to security and guarantees rights corresponding to those guaranteed in Article\u00a05 of the ECHR (see, to that effect, judgments of 15\u00a0February 2016, \nN.\n, C-601/15\u00a0PPU, EU:C:2016:84, paragraph\u00a047; of 28\u00a0July 2016, \nJZ\n, C-294/16\u00a0PPU, EU:C:2016:610, paragraph\u00a048; and of 19\u00a0September 2019, \nRayonna prokuratura Lom\n, C-467/18, EU:C:2019:765, paragraph\u00a042 and the case-law cited).\n124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it should be recalled that Article\u00a052(3) of the Charter is intended to ensure the necessary consistency between the rights contained in the Charter and the corresponding rights guaranteed in the ECHR, without adversely affecting the autonomy of EU law and that of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Account must therefore be taken of the corresponding rights of the ECHR for the purpose of interpreting the Charter, as the minimum threshold of protection (see, to that effect, judgments of 12\u00a0February 2019, \nTC\n, C-492/18\u00a0PPU, EU:C:2019:108, paragraph\u00a057, and of 21\u00a0May 2019, \nCommission\n v \nHungary (Rights of usufruct over agricultural land)\n, C-235/17, EU:C:2019:432, paragraph\u00a072 and the case-law cited).\n125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a05 of the ECHR, which enshrines the \u2018right to liberty\u2019 and the \u2018right to security\u2019, is intended, according to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, to ensure that individuals are protected from arbitrary or unjustified deprivations of liberty (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 18\u00a0March 2008, \nLadent v. Poland\n, CE:ECHR:2008:0318JUD001103603, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045 and 46; 29\u00a0March 2010, \nMedvedyev and Others v. France\n, CE:ECHR:2010:0329JUD000339403, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a076 and 77; and 13\u00a0December 2012, \nEl-Masri v. \u2018The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u2019\n, CE:ECHR:2012:1213JUD003963009, \u00a7\u00a0239). However, since that provision applies to deprivations of liberty by a public authority, Article\u00a06 of the Charter cannot be interpreted as imposing an obligation on public authorities to take specific measures to prevent and punish certain criminal offences.\n126\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, as regards, in particular, effective action to combat criminal offences committed against, inter alia, minors and other vulnerable persons, mentioned by the Cour constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court, Belgium), it should be pointed out that positive obligations of the public authorities may result from Article\u00a07 of the Charter, requiring them to adopt legal measures to protect private and family life (see, to that effect, judgment of 18\u00a0June 2020, \nCommission\n v \nHungary (Transparency of associations)\n, C-78/18, EU:C:2020:476, paragraph\u00a0123 and the case-law cited of the European Court of Human Rights). Such obligations may also arise from Article\u00a07, concerning the protection of an individual\u2019s home and communications, and Articles\u00a03 and 4, as regards the protection of an individual\u2019s physical and mental integrity and the prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment.\n127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is against the backdrop of those different positive obligations that the Court must strike a balance between the various interests and rights at issue.\n128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The European Court of Human Rights has held that the positive obligations flowing from Articles\u00a03 and 8 of the ECHR, whose corresponding safeguards are set out in Articles\u00a04 and 7 of the Charter, require, in particular, the adoption of substantive and procedural provisions as well as practical measures enabling effective action to combat crimes against the person through effective investigation and prosecution, that obligation being all the more important when a child\u2019s physical and moral well-being is at risk. However, the measures to be taken by the competent authorities must fully respect due process and the other safeguards limiting the scope of criminal investigation powers, as well as other freedoms and rights. In particular, according to that court, a legal framework should be established enabling a balance to be struck between the various interests and rights to be protected (ECtHR, 28\u00a0October 1998, \nOsman v. United Kingdom\n, CE:ECHR:1998:1028JUD002345294, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0115 and 116; 4\u00a0March 2004, \nM.C. v. Bulgaria\n, CE:ECHR:2003:1204JUD003927298, \u00a7\u00a0151; 24\u00a0June 2004, \nVon Hannover v. Germany\n, CE:ECHR:2004:0624JUD005932000, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a057 and 58; and 2\u00a0December 2008, \nK.U. v. Finland\n, CE:ECHR:2008:1202JUD000287202, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046, 48 and 49).\n129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concerning observance of the principle of proportionality, the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 provides that the Member States may adopt a measure derogating from the principle that communications and the related traffic data are to be confidential where such a measure is \u2018necessary, appropriate and proportionate\u00a0\u2026 within a democratic society\u2019, in view of the objectives set out in that provision. Recital\u00a011 of that directive specifies that a measure of that nature must be \u2018strictly\u2019 proportionate to the intended purpose.\n130\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that the protection of the fundamental right to privacy requires, according to the settled case-law of the Court, that derogations from and limitations on the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. In addition, an objective of general interest may not be pursued without having regard to the fact that it must be reconciled with the fundamental rights affected by the measure, by properly balancing the objective of general interest against the rights at issue (see, to that effect, judgments of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a056; of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraphs\u00a076, 77 and 86; and of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a052; Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0140).\n131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specifically, it follows from the Court\u2019s case-law that the question whether the Member States may justify a limitation on the rights and obligations laid down, inter alia, in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58 must be assessed by measuring the seriousness of the interference entailed by such a limitation and by verifying that the importance of the public interest objective pursued by that limitation is proportionate to that seriousness (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraph\u00a055 and the case-law cited).\n132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to satisfy the requirement of proportionality, the legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose personal data is affected have sufficient guarantees that data will be effectively protected against the risk of abuse. That legislation must be legally binding under domestic law and, in particular, must indicate in what circumstances and under which conditions a measure providing for the processing of such data may be adopted, thereby ensuring that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subjected to automated processing, particularly where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to that data. Those considerations apply especially where the protection of the particular category of personal data that is sensitive data is at stake (see, to that effect, judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraphs\u00a054 and 55, and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0117; Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada \nPNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0141).\n133\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, legislation requiring the retention of personal data must always meet objective criteria that establish a connection between the data to be retained and the objective pursued (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0191 and the case-law cited, and judgment of 3\u00a0October 2019, \nA and Others\n, C-70/18, EU:C:2019:823, paragraph\u00a063).\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLegislative measures providing for the preventive retention of traffic and location data for the purpose of safeguarding national security\n134\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be observed that the objective of safeguarding national security, mentioned by the referring courts and the governments which submitted observations, has not yet been specifically examined by the Court in its judgments interpreting Directive 2002/58.\n135\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted, at the outset, that Article\u00a04(2) TEU provides that national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State. That responsibility corresponds to the primary interest in protecting the essential functions of the State and the fundamental interests of society and encompasses the prevention and punishment of activities capable of seriously destabilising the fundamental constitutional, political, economic or social structures of a country and, in particular, of directly threatening society, the population or the State itself, such as terrorist activities.\n136\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The importance of the objective of safeguarding national security, read in the light of Article\u00a04(2) TEU, goes beyond that of the other objectives referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, inter alia the objectives of combating crime in general, even serious crime, and of safeguarding public security. Threats such as those referred to in the preceding paragraph can be distinguished, by their nature and particular seriousness, from the general risk that tensions or disturbances, even of a serious nature, affecting public security will arise. Subject to meeting the other requirements laid down in Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, the objective of safeguarding national security is therefore capable of justifying measures entailing more serious interferences with fundamental rights than those which might be justified by those other objectives.\n137\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in situations such as those described in paragraphs\u00a0135 and 136 of the present judgment, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, does not, in principle, preclude a legislative measure which permits the competent authorities to order providers of electronic communications services to retain traffic and location data of all users of electronic communications systems for a limited period of time, as long as there are sufficiently solid grounds for considering that the Member State concerned is confronted with a serious threat, as referred to in paragraphs\u00a0135 and 136 of the present judgment, to national security which is shown to be genuine and present or foreseeable. Even if such a measure is applied indiscriminately to all users of electronic communications systems, without there being at first sight any connection, within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a0133 of the present judgment, with a threat to the national security of that Member State, it must nevertheless be considered that the existence of that threat is, in itself, capable of establishing that connection.\n138\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The instruction for the preventive retention of data of all users of electronic communications systems must, however, be limited in time to what is strictly necessary. Although it is conceivable that an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services to retain data may, owing to the ongoing nature of such a threat, be renewed, the duration of each instruction cannot exceed a foreseeable period of time. Moreover, such data retention must be subject to limitations and must be circumscribed by strict safeguards making it possible to protect effectively the personal data of the persons concerned against the risk of abuse. Thus, that retention cannot be systematic in nature.\n139\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the seriousness of the interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter resulting from a measure involving the general and indiscriminate retention of data, it must be ensured that recourse to such a measure is in fact limited to situations in which there is a serious threat to national security as referred to in paragraphs\u00a0135 and 136 of the present judgment. For that purpose, it is essential that decisions giving an instruction to providers of electronic communications services to carry out such data retention be subject to effective review, either by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision is binding, the aim of that review being to verify that one of those situations exists and that the conditions and safeguards which must be laid down are observed.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLegislative measures providing for the preventive retention of traffic and location data for the purposes of combating crime and safeguarding public security\n140\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objective of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, only action to combat serious crime and measures to prevent serious threats to public security are capable of justifying serious interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, such as the interference entailed by the retention of traffic and location data. Accordingly, only non-serious interference with those fundamental rights may be justified by the objective of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences in general (see, to that effect, judgments of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0102, and of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraphs\u00a056 and 57; Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0149).\n141\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National legislation providing for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data for the purpose of combating serious crime exceeds the limits of what is strictly necessary and cannot be considered to be justified, within a democratic society, as required by Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0107).\n142\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the sensitive nature of the information that traffic and location data may provide, the confidentiality of that data is essential for the right to respect for private life. Thus, having regard, first, to the deterrent effect on the exercise of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 11 of the Charter, referred to in paragraph\u00a0118 above, which is liable to result from the retention of that data, and, second, to the seriousness of the interference entailed by such retention, it is necessary, within a democratic society, that retention be the exception and not the rule, as provided for in the system established by Directive 2002/58, and that the data not be retained systematically and continuously. That conclusion applies even having regard to the objectives of combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security and to the importance to be attached to them.\n143\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Court has emphasised that legislation providing for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data covers the electronic communications of practically the entire population without any differentiation, limitation or exception being made in the light of the objective pursued. Such legislation, in contrast to the requirement mentioned in paragraph\u00a0133 above, is comprehensive in that it affects all persons using electronic communications services, even though those persons are not, even indirectly, in a situation that is liable to give rise to criminal proceedings. It therefore applies even to persons with respect to whom there is no evidence capable of suggesting that their conduct might have a link, even an indirect or remote one, with that objective of combating serious crime and, in particular, without there being any relationship between the data whose retention is provided for and a threat to public security (see, to that effect, judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraphs\u00a057 and 58, and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0105).\n144\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, as the Court has previously held, such legislation is not restricted to retention in relation to (i) data pertaining to a time period and/or geographical area and/or a group of persons likely to be involved, in one way or another, in a serious crime, or (ii) persons who could, for other reasons, contribute, through their data being retained, to combating serious crime (see, to that effect, judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a059, and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0106).\n145\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even the positive obligations of the Member States which may arise, depending on the circumstances, from Articles\u00a03, 4 and 7 of the Charter and relating, as pointed out in paragraphs\u00a0126 and 128 of the present judgment, to the establishment of rules to facilitate effective action to combat criminal offences cannot have the effect of justifying interference that is as serious as that entailed by legislation providing for the retention of traffic and location data with the fundamental rights, enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, of practically the entire population, without there being a link, at least an indirect one, between the data of the persons concerned and the objective pursued.\n146\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, in accordance with what has been stated in paragraphs\u00a0142 to 144 of the present judgment, and having regard to the balance that must be struck between the rights and interests at issue, the objectives of combating serious crime, preventing serious attacks on public security and, a fortiori, safeguarding national security are capable of justifying\u00a0\u2013 given their importance, in the light of the positive obligations mentioned in the preceding paragraph to which the Cour constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court, Belgium), referred, inter alia\u00a0\u2013 the particularly serious interference entailed by the targeted retention of traffic and location data.\n147\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, as the Court has previously held, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, does not prevent a Member State from adopting legislation permitting, as a preventive measure, the targeted retention of traffic and location data for the purposes of combating serious crime, preventing serious threats to public security and equally of safeguarding national security, provided that such retention is limited, with respect to the categories of data to be retained, the means of communication affected, the persons concerned and the retention period adopted, to what is strictly necessary (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0108).\n148\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the limits to which such a data retention measure must be subject, these may, in particular, be determined according to the categories of persons concerned, since Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 does not preclude legislation based on objective evidence which makes it possible to target persons whose traffic and location data is likely to reveal a link, at least an indirect one, with serious criminal offences, to contribute in one way or another to combating serious crime or to preventing a serious risk to public security or a risk to national security (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0111).\n149\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be made clear that the persons thus targeted may, in particular, be persons who have been identified beforehand, in the course of the applicable national procedures and on the basis of objective evidence, as posing a threat to public or national security in the Member State concerned.\n150\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The limits on a measure providing for the retention of traffic and location data may also be set using a geographical criterion where the competent national authorities consider, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, that there exists, in one or more geographical areas, a situation characterised by a high risk of preparation for or commission of serious criminal offences (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0111). Those areas may include places with a high incidence of serious crime, places that are particularly vulnerable to the commission of serious criminal offences, such as places or infrastructure which regularly receive a very high volume of visitors, or strategic locations, such as airports, stations or tollbooth areas.\n151\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure that the interference entailed by the targeted retention measures described in paragraphs\u00a0147 to 150 of the present judgment complies with the principle of proportionality, their duration must not exceed what is strictly necessary in the light of the objective pursued and the circumstances justifying them, without prejudice to the possibility of extending those measures should such retention continue to be necessary.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLegislative measures providing for the preventive retention of IP addresses and data relating to civil identity for the purposes of combating crime and safeguarding public security\n152\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that although IP addresses are part of traffic data, they are generated independently of any particular communication and mainly serve to identify, through providers of electronic communications services, the natural person who owns the terminal equipment from which an Internet communication is made. Thus, in relation to email and Internet telephony, provided that only the IP addresses of the source of the communication are retained and not the IP addresses of the recipient of the communication, those addresses do not, as such, disclose any information about third parties who were in contact with the person who made the communication. That category of data is therefore less sensitive than other traffic data.\n153\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, since IP addresses may be used, among other things, to track an Internet user\u2019s complete clickstream and, therefore, his or her entire online activity, that data enables a detailed profile of the user to be produced. Thus, the retention and analysis of those IP addresses which is required for such tracking constitute a serious interference with the fundamental rights of the Internet user enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, which may have a deterrent effect as mentioned in paragraph\u00a0118 of the present judgment.\n154\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to strike a balance between the rights and interests at issue as required by the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a0130 of the present judgment, account must be taken of the fact that, where an offence is committed online, the IP address might be the only means of investigation enabling the person to whom that address was assigned at the time of the commission of the offence to be identified. To that consideration must be added the fact that the retention of IP addresses by providers of electronic communications services beyond the period for which that data is assigned does not, in principle, appear to be necessary for the purpose of billing the services at issue, with the result that the detection of offences committed online may therefore prove impossible without recourse to a legislative measure under Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, something which several governments mentioned in their observations to the Court. As those governments argued, that may occur, inter alia, in cases involving particularly serious child pornography offences, such as the acquisition, dissemination, transmission or making available online of child pornography, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(c) of Directive 2011/93/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13\u00a0December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA (OJ 2011 L\u00a0335, p.\u00a01).\n155\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, while it is true that a legislative measure providing for the retention of the IP addresses of all natural persons who own terminal equipment permitting access to the Internet would catch persons who at first sight have no connection, within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a0133 of the present judgment, with the objectives pursued, and it is also true, in accordance with what has been stated in paragraph\u00a0109 of the present judgment, that Internet users are entitled to expect, under Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, that their identity will not, in principle, be disclosed, a legislative measure providing for the general and indiscriminate retention of only IP addresses assigned to the source of a connection does not, in principle, appear to be contrary to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, provided that that possibility is subject to strict compliance with the substantive and procedural conditions which should regulate the use of that data.\n156\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the seriousness of the interference entailed by that retention with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, only action to combat serious crime, the prevention of serious threats to public security and the safeguarding of national security are capable of justifying that interference. Moreover, the retention period must not exceed what is strictly necessary in the light of the objective pursued. Finally, a measure of that nature must establish strict conditions and safeguards concerning the use of that data, particularly via tracking, with regard to communications made and activities carried out online by the persons concerned.\n157\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concerning, last, data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems, that data does not, in itself, make it possible to ascertain the date, time, duration and recipients of the communications made, or the locations where those communications took place or their frequency with specific people during a given period, with the result that it does not provide, apart from the contact details of those users, such as their addresses, any information on the communications sent and, consequently, on the users\u2019 private lives. Thus, the interference entailed by the retention of that data cannot, in principle, be classified as serious (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraphs\u00a059 and 60).\n158\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in accordance with what has been stated in paragraph\u00a0140 of the present judgment, legislative measures concerning the processing of that data as such, including the retention of and access to that data solely for the purpose of identifying the user concerned, and without it being possible for that data to be associated with information on the communications made, are capable of being justified by the objective of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences in general, to which the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 refers (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraph\u00a062).\n159\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, having regard to the balance that must be struck between the rights and interests at issue, and for the reasons set out in paragraphs\u00a0131 and 158 of the present judgment, it must be held that, even in the absence of a connection between all users of electronic communications systems and the objectives pursued, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, does not preclude a legislative measure which requires providers of electronic communications services, without imposing a specific time limit, to retain data relating to the civil identity of all users of electronic communications systems for the purposes of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences and safeguarding public security, there being no need for the criminal offences or the threats to or acts having adverse effects on public security to be serious.\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLegislative measures providing for the expedited retention of traffic and location data for the purpose of combating serious crime\n160\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to traffic and location data processed and stored by providers of electronic communications services on the basis of Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58 or on the basis of legislative measures taken under Article\u00a015(1) of that directive, as described in paragraphs\u00a0134 to 159 of the present judgment, it should be noted that that data must, in principle, be erased or made anonymous, depending on the circumstances, at the end of the statutory periods within which that data must be processed and stored in accordance with the national provisions transposing that directive.\n161\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, during that processing and storage, situations may arise in which it becomes necessary to retain that data after those time periods have ended in order to shed light on serious criminal offences or acts adversely affecting national security; this is the case both in situations where those offences or acts having adverse effects have already been established and where, after an objective examination of all of the relevant circumstances, such offences or acts having adverse effects may reasonably be suspected.\n162\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention on Cybercrime of 23\u00a0November 2001 (European Treaty Series\u00a0\u2013 No.\u00a0185), which was signed by the 27 Member States and ratified by 25 of them and has as its objective to facilitate the fight against criminal offences committed using computer networks, provides, in Article\u00a014, that the parties to the convention are to adopt, for the purpose of specific criminal investigations or proceedings, certain measures concerning traffic data already stored, such as the expedited preservation of that data. In particular, Article\u00a016(1) of that convention stipulates that the parties to that convention are to adopt such legislative measures as may be necessary to enable their competent authorities to order or similarly obtain the expedited preservation of traffic data that has been stored by means of a computer system, in particular where there are grounds to believe that that data is particularly vulnerable to loss or modification.\n163\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a situation such as the one described in paragraph\u00a0161 of the present judgment, in the light of the balance that must be struck between the rights and interests at issue referred to in paragraph\u00a0130 of the present judgment, it is permissible for Member States to provide, in legislation adopted pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, for the possibility of instructing, by means of a decision of the competent authority which is subject to effective judicial review, providers of electronic communications services to undertake the expedited retention of traffic and location data at their disposal for a specified period of time.\n164\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent that the purpose of such expedited retention no longer corresponds to the purpose for which that data was initially collected and retained and since any processing of data must, under Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter, be consistent with specified purposes, Member States must make clear, in their legislation, for what purpose the expedited retention of data may occur. In the light of the serious nature of the interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter which such retention may entail, only action to combat serious crime and, a fortiori, the safeguarding of national security are such as to justify such interference. Moreover, in order to ensure that the interference entailed by a measure of that kind is limited to what is strictly necessary, first, the retention obligation must relate only to traffic and location data that may shed light on the serious criminal offences or the acts adversely affecting national security concerned. Second, the duration for which such data is retained must be limited to what is strictly necessary, although that duration can be extended where the circumstances and the objective pursued by that measure justify doing so.\n165\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, such expedited retention need not be limited to the data of persons specifically suspected of having committed a criminal offence or acts adversely affecting national security. While it must comply with the framework established by Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, and taking into account the findings in paragraph\u00a0133 above, such a measure may, at the choice of the legislature and subject to the limits of what is strictly necessary, be extended to traffic and location data relating to persons other than those who are suspected of having planned or committed a serious criminal offence or acts adversely affecting national security, provided that that data can, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, shed light on such an offence or acts adversely affecting national security, such as data concerning the victim thereof, his or her social or professional circle, or even specified geographical areas, such as the place where the offence or act adversely affecting national security at issue was committed or prepared. Additionally, the competent authorities must be given access to the data thus retained in observance of the conditions that emerge from the case-law on how Directive 2002/58 is to be interpreted (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraphs\u00a0118 to 121 and the case-law cited).\n166\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be added that, as is clear, in particular, from paragraphs\u00a0115 and 133 above, access to traffic and location data retained by providers in accordance with a measure taken under Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 may, in principle, be justified only by the public interest objective for which those providers were ordered to retain that data. It follows, in particular, that access to such data for the purpose of prosecuting and punishing an ordinary criminal offence may in no event be granted where the retention of such data has been justified by the objective of combating serious crime or, a fortiori, by the objective of safeguarding national security. However, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, as mentioned in paragraph\u00a0131 above, access to data retained for the purpose of combating serious crime may, provided that the substantive and procedural conditions associated with such access referred to in the previous paragraph are observed, be justified by the objective of safeguarding national security.\n167\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is permissible for Member States to specify in their legislation that access to traffic and location data may, subject to those same substantive and procedural conditions, be permitted for the purpose of combating serious crime or safeguarding national security where that data is retained by a provider in a manner that is consistent with Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 or Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58.\n168\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all of the above considerations, the answer to question\u00a01 in Cases C-511/18 and C-512/18 and questions\u00a01 and 2 in Case C-520/18 is that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding legislative measures which, for the purposes laid down in Article\u00a015(1), provide, as a preventive measure, for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data. By contrast, Article\u00a015(1), read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, does not preclude legislative measures that:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0allow, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, recourse to an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services to retain, generally and indiscriminately, traffic and location data in situations where the Member State concerned is confronted with a serious threat to national security that is shown to be genuine and present or foreseeable, where the decision imposing such an instruction is subject to effective review, either by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision is binding, the aim of that review being to verify that one of those situations exists and that the conditions and safeguards which must be laid down are observed, and where that instruction may be given only for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary, but which may be extended if that threat persists;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0provide, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, for the targeted retention of traffic and location data which is limited, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, according to the categories of persons concerned or using a geographical criterion, for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary, but which may be extended;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0provide, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, for the general and indiscriminate retention of IP addresses assigned to the source of an Internet connection for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0provide, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, combating crime and safeguarding public security, for the general and indiscriminate retention of data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0allow, for the purposes of combating serious crime and, a fortiori, safeguarding national security, recourse to an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services, by means of a decision of the competent authority that is subject to effective judicial review, to undertake, for a specified period of time, the expedited retention of traffic and location data in the possession of those service providers,\nprovided that those measures ensure, by means of clear and precise rules, that the retention of data at issue is subject to compliance with the applicable substantive and procedural conditions and that the persons concerned have effective safeguards against the risks of abuse.\n\u00a0\nQuestions\n\u00a0\n2 and 3 in Case C\n-\n511/18\n169\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By questions\u00a02 and 3 in Case C-511/18, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which requires providers of electronic communications services to implement, on their networks, measures allowing, first, the automated analysis and real-time collection of traffic and location data and, second, real-time collection of technical data concerning the location of the terminal equipment used, but which makes no provision for the persons concerned by that processing and that collection to be notified thereof.\n170\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court notes that the intelligence gathering techniques provided for in Articles\u00a0L.\u00a0851-2 to L.\u00a0851-4 of the CSI do not impose on providers of electronic communications services a specific obligation to retain traffic and location data. With regard, in particular, to the automated analysis referred to in Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-3 of the CSI, the referring court observes that the aim of that processing is to detect, according to criteria established for that purpose, links that might constitute a terrorist threat. As for the real-time collection referred to in Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-2 of the CSI, that court notes that such collection concerns exclusively one or more persons who have been identified in advance as potentially having a link to a terrorist threat. According to that same court, those two techniques may be implemented only with a view to preventing terrorism and cover the data referred to in Articles\u00a0L.\u00a0851-1 and R.\u00a0851-5 of the CSI.\n171\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the fact that, according to Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-3 of the CSI, the automated analysis that it provides for does not, as such, allow the users whose data is being analysed to be identified, does not prevent such data from being classified as \u2018personal data\u2019. Since the procedure provided for in point\u00a0IV of that provision allows the person or persons concerned by the data, the automated analysis of which has shown that there may be a terrorist threat, to be identified at a later stage, all persons whose data has been the subject of automated analysis can still be identified from that data. According to the definition of personal data in Article\u00a04(1) of Regulation 2016/679, information relating, inter alia, to an identifiable person constitutes personal data.\n\u00a0\nAutomated analysis of traffic and location data\n172\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-3 of the CSI that the automated analysis for which it provides corresponds, in essence, to a screening of all the traffic and location data retained by providers of electronic communications services, which is carried out by those providers at the request of the competent national authorities applying the parameters set by the latter. It follows that all data of users of electronic communications systems is verified if it corresponds to those parameters. Therefore, such automated analysis must be considered as involving, for the providers of electronic communications services concerned, the undertaking on behalf of the competent authority of general and indiscriminate processing, in the form of the use of that data with the assistance of an automated operation, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of Regulation 2016/679, covering all traffic and location data of all users of electronic communications systems. That processing is independent of the subsequent collection of data relating to the persons identified following that automated analysis, such collection being authorised on the basis of Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-3, IV, of the CSI.\n173\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National legislation authorising such automated analysis of traffic and location data derogates from the obligation of principle, established in Article\u00a05 of Directive 2002/58, to ensure the confidentiality of electronic communications and related data. Such legislation also constitutes interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, regardless of how that data is used subsequently. Finally, as was stated in the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a0118 of the present judgment, such legislation is likely to have a deterrent effect on the exercise of freedom of expression, which is enshrined in Article\u00a011 of the Charter.\n174\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the interference resulting from the automated analysis of traffic and location data, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, is particularly serious since it covers, generally and indiscriminately, the data of persons using electronic communication systems. That finding is all the more justified given that, as is clear from the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, the data that is the subject of the automated analysis is likely to reveal the nature of the information consulted online. In addition, such automated analysis is applied generally to all persons who use electronic communication systems and, consequently, applies also to persons with respect to whom there is no evidence capable of suggesting that their conduct might have a link, even an indirect or remote one, with terrorist activities.\n175\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the justification for such interference, the requirement, established in Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, that any limitation on the exercise of fundamental rights must be provided for by law implies that the legal basis which permits that interference with those rights must itself define the scope of the limitation on the exercise of the right concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0175 and the case-law cited).\n176\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, in order to meet the requirement of proportionality recalled in paragraphs\u00a0130 and 131 of the present judgment, according to which derogations from and limitations on the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary, national legislation governing the access of the competent authorities to retained traffic and location data must comply with the requirements that emerge from the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a0132 of the present judgment. In particular, such legislation cannot be limited to requiring that the authorities\u2019 access to such data should correspond to the objective pursued by that legislation, but must also lay down the substantive and procedural conditions governing that use (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0192 and the case-law cited).\n177\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that the particularly serious interference that is constituted by the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data, as referred to in the findings in paragraphs\u00a0134 to 139 of the present judgment, and the particularly serious interference constituted by the automated analysis of that data can meet the requirement of proportionality only in situations in which a Member State is facing a serious threat to national security which is shown to be genuine and present or foreseeable, and provided that the duration of that retention is limited to what is strictly necessary.\n178\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In situations such as those referred to in the previous paragraph, the implementation of automated analysis of the traffic and location data of all users of electronic communications systems, for a strictly limited period, may be considered to be justified in the light of the requirements stemming from Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter.\n179\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being said, in order to guarantee that such a measure is actually limited to what is strictly necessary in order to protect national security and, more particularly, to prevent terrorism, in accordance with what was held in paragraph\u00a0139 of the present judgment, it is essential that the decision authorising automated analysis be subject to effective review, either by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision is binding, the aim of that review being to verify that a situation justifying that measure exists and that the conditions and safeguards that must be laid down are observed.\n180\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that the pre-established models and criteria on which that type of data processing are based should be, first, specific and reliable, making it possible to achieve results identifying individuals who might be under a reasonable suspicion of participation in terrorist offences and, second, should be non-discriminatory (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0172).\n181\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it must be noted that any automated analysis carried out on the basis of models and criteria founded on the premiss that racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, or information about a person\u2019s health or sex life could, in themselves and regardless of the individual conduct of that person, be relevant in order to prevent terrorism would infringe the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, read in conjunction with Article\u00a021 thereof. Therefore, pre-established models and criteria for the purposes of an automated analysis that has as its objective the prevention of terrorist activities that constitute a serious threat to national security cannot be based on that sensitive data in isolation (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0165).\n182\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, since the automated analyses of traffic and location data necessarily involve some margin of error, any positive result obtained following automated processing must be subject to an individual re-examination by non-automated means before an individual measure adversely affecting the persons concerned is adopted, such as the subsequent real-time collection of traffic and location data, since such a measure cannot be based solely and decisively on the result of automated processing. Similarly, in order to ensure that, in practice, the pre-established models and criteria, the use that is made of them and the databases used are not discriminatory and are limited to that which is strictly necessary in the light of the objective of preventing terrorist activities that constitute a serious threat to national security, a regular re-examination should be undertaken to ensure that those pre-established models and criteria and the databases used are reliable and up to date (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0173 and 174).\n\u00a0\nReal-time collection of traffic and location data\n183\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The real-time collection of traffic and location data referred to in Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-2 of the CSI may be individually authorised in respect of a \u2018person previously identified as potentially having links to a [terrorist] threat\u2019. Moreover, according to that description, and \u2018where there are substantial grounds for believing that one or more persons belonging to the circle of the person to whom the authorisation relates are capable of providing information in respect of the purpose for which the authorisation was granted, authorisation may also be granted individually for each of those persons\u2019.\n184\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The data that is the subject of such a measure allows the national competent authorities to monitor, for the duration of the authorisation, continuously and in real time, the persons with whom those persons are communicating, the means that they use, the duration of their communications and their places of residence and movements. It may also reveal the type of information consulted online. Taken as a whole, as is clear from paragraph\u00a0117 of the present judgment, that data makes it possible to draw very precise conclusions concerning the private lives of the persons concerned and provides the means to establish a profile of the individuals concerned, information that is no less sensitive, from the perspective of the right to privacy, than the actual content of communications.\n185\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the real-time collection of data referred to in Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-4 of the CSI, that provision authorises technical data concerning the location of terminal equipment to be collected and transmitted in real time to a department reporting to the Prime Minister. It appears that such data allows the department responsible, at any moment throughout the duration of that authorisation, to locate, continuously and in real time, the terminal equipment used, such as mobile telephones.\n186\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like national legislation authorising the automated analysis of data, national legislation authorising such real-time collection derogates from the obligation of principle, established in Article\u00a05 of Directive 2002/58, to ensure the confidentiality of electronic communications and related data. It therefore also constitutes interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter and is likely to have a deterrent effect on the exercise of freedom of expression, which is guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter.\n187\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be emphasised that the interference constituted by the real-time collection of data that allows terminal equipment to be located appears particularly serious, since that data provides the competent national authorities with a means of accurately and permanently tracking the movements of users of mobile telephones. To the extent that that data must therefore be considered to be particularly sensitive, real-time access by the competent authorities to such data must be distinguished from non-real-time access to that data, the first being more intrusive in that it allows for monitoring of those users that is virtually total (see, by analogy, with regard to Article\u00a08 of the ECHR, ECtHR, 8\u00a0February 2018,\n Ben Faiza \nv. \nFrance\n CE:ECHR:2018:0208JUD003144612, \u00a7\u00a074). The seriousness of that interference is further aggravated where the real-time collection also extends to the traffic data of the persons concerned.\n188\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the objective of preventing terrorism pursued by the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings is liable, given its importance, to justify interference in the form of the real-time collection of traffic and location data, such a measure may be implemented, taking into account its particularly intrusive nature, only in respect of persons with respect to whom there is a valid reason to suspect that they are involved in one way or another in terrorist activities. With regard to persons falling outside of that category, they may only be the subject of non-real-time access, which may occur, in accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law, only in particular situations, such as those involving terrorist activities, and where there is objective evidence from which it can be deduced that that data might, in a specific case, make an effective contribution to combating terrorism (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0119 and the case-law cited).\n189\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, a decision authorising the real-time collection of traffic and location data must be based on objective criteria provided for in the national legislation. In particular, that legislation must define, in accordance with the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a0176 of the present judgment, the circumstances and conditions under which such collection may be authorised and must provide that, as was pointed out in the previous paragraph, only persons with a link to the objective of preventing terrorism may be subject to such collection. In addition, a decision authorising the real-time collection of traffic and location data must be based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria provided for in national legislation. In order to ensure, in practice, that those conditions are observed, it is essential that the implementation of the measure authorising real-time collection be subject to a prior review carried out either by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision is binding, with that court or body having to satisfy itself, inter alia, that such real-time collection is authorised only within the limits of what is strictly necessary (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0120). In cases of duly justified urgency, the review must take place within a short time.\n\u00a0\nNotification of persons whose data has been collected or analysed\n190\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent national authorities undertaking real-time collection of traffic and location data must notify the persons concerned, in accordance with the applicable national procedures, to the extent that and as soon as that notification is no longer liable to jeopardise the tasks for which those authorities are responsible. That notification is, indeed, necessary to enable the persons affected to exercise their rights under Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter to request access to their personal data that has been the subject of those measures and, where appropriate, to have the latter rectified or erased, as well as to avail themselves, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, of an effective remedy before a tribunal, that right indeed being explicitly guaranteed in Article\u00a015(2) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a079(1) of Regulation 2016/679 (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0121 and the case-law cited, and Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0219 and 220).\n191\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the notification required in the context of automated analysis of traffic and location data, the competent national authority is obliged to publish information of a general nature relating to that analysis without having to notify the persons concerned individually. However, if the data matches the parameters specified in the measure authorising automated analysis and that authority identifies the person concerned in order to analyse in greater depth the data concerning him or her, it is necessary to notify that person individually. That notification must, however, occur only to the extent that and as soon as it is no longer liable to jeopardise the tasks for which those authorities are responsible (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0222 and 224).\n192\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to questions\u00a02 and 3 in Case C-511/18 is that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as not precluding national rules which requires providers of electronic communications services to have recourse, first, to the automated analysis and real-time collection, inter alia, of traffic and location data and, second, to the real-time collection of technical data concerning the location of the terminal equipment used, where:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0recourse to automated analysis is limited to situations in which a Member State is facing a serious threat to national security which is shown to be genuine and present or foreseeable, and where recourse to such analysis may be the subject of an effective review, either by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision is binding, the aim of that review being to verify that a situation justifying that measure exists and that the conditions and safeguards that must be laid down are observed; and where\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0recourse to the real-time collection of traffic and location data is limited to persons in respect of whom there is a valid reason to suspect that they are involved in one way or another in terrorist activities and is subject to a prior review carried out either by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision is binding in order to ensure that such real-time collection is authorised only within the limits of what is strictly necessary. In cases of duly justified urgency, the review must take place within a short time.\n\u00a0\nQuestion\n\u00a0\n2 in Case C\n-\n512/18\n193\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By question\u00a02 in Case C-512/18, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether the provisions of Directive 2000/31, read in the light of Articles\u00a06, 7, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which requires providers of access to online public communication services and hosting service providers to retain, generally and indiscriminately, inter alia, personal data relating to those services.\n194\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the referring court maintains that such services fall within the scope of Directive 2000/31 rather than within that of Directive 2002/58, it takes the view that Article\u00a015(1) and (2) of Directive 2000/31, read in conjunction with Articles\u00a012 and 14 of the same, does not, in itself, establish a prohibition in principle on data relating to content creation being retained, which can be derogated from only exceptionally. However, that court is uncertain whether that finding can be made given that the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a06, 7, 8 and 11 of the Charter must necessarily be observed.\n195\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the referring court points out that its question is raised in reference to the obligation to retain provided for in Article\u00a06 of the LCEN, read in conjunction with Decree No\u00a02011-219. The data that must be retained by the service providers concerned on that basis includes, inter alia, data relating to the civil identity of persons who have used those services, such as their surname, forename, their associated postal addresses, their associated email or account addresses, their passwords and, where the subscription to the contract or account must be paid for, the type of payment used, the payment reference, the amount and the date and time of the transaction.\n196\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the data that is the subject of the obligation to retain covers the identifiers of subscribers, of connections and of terminal equipment used, the identifiers attributed to the content, the dates and times of the start and end of the connections and operations as well as the types of protocols used to connect to the service and transfer the content. Access to that data, which must be retained for one year, may be requested in the context of criminal and civil proceedings, in order to ensure compliance with the rules governing civil and criminal liability, and in the context of the intelligence collection measures to which Article\u00a0L.\u00a0851-1 of the CSI applies.\n197\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, in accordance with Article\u00a01(2) of Directive 2000/31, that directive approximates certain national provisions on information society services that are referred to in Article\u00a02(a) of that directive.\n198\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that such services include those which are provided at a distance, by means of electronic equipment for the processing and storage of data, at the individual request of a recipient of services, and normally in return for remuneration, such as services providing access to the Internet or to a communication network and hosting services (see, to that effect, judgments of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nScarlet Extended\n, C-70/10, EU:C:2011:771, paragraph\u00a040; of 16\u00a0February 2012, \nSABAM\n, C-360/10, EU:C:2012:85, paragraph\u00a034; of 15\u00a0September 2016, \nMc Fadden\n, C-484/14, EU:C:2016:689, paragraph\u00a055; and of 7\u00a0August 2018, \nSNB-REACT\n, C-521/17, EU:C:2018:639, paragraph\u00a042 and the case-law cited).\n199\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Article\u00a01(5) of Directive 2000/31 provides that that directive is not to apply to questions relating to information society services covered by Directives 95/46 and 97/66. In that regard, it is clear from recitals\u00a014 and 15 of Directive 2000/31 that the protection of the confidentiality of communications and of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data in the context of information society services are governed only by Directives 95/46 and 97/66, the latter of which prohibits, in Article\u00a05 thereof, all forms of interception or surveillance of communications, in order to protect confidentiality.\n200\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Questions related to the protection of the confidentiality of communications and personal data must be assessed on the basis of Directive 2002/58 and Regulation 2016/679, which replaced Directive 97/66 and Directive 95/46 respectively, and it should be noted that the protection that Directive 2000/31 is intended to ensure cannot, in any event, undermine the requirements under Directive 2002/58 and Regulation 2016/679 (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008, \nPromusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraph\u00a057).\n201\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The obligation imposed by the national legislation referred to in paragraph\u00a0195 of the present judgment on providers of access to online public communication services and hosting service providers requiring them to retain personal data relating to those services must, therefore\u00a0\u2013 as the Advocate General proposed in point\u00a0141 of his Opinion in Joined Cases \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18 and C-512/18, EU:C:2020:6)\u00a0\u2013 be assessed on the basis of Directive 2002/58 or Regulation 2016/679.\n202\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, depending on whether the provision of services covered by that national legislation falls within the scope of Directive 2002/58 or not, it is to be governed either by that directive, specifically by Article\u00a015(1) thereof, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, or by Regulation 2016/679, specifically by Article\u00a023(1) of that regulation, read in the light of the same articles of the Charter.\n203\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, it is conceivable, as the European Commission submitted in its written observations, that some of the services to which the national legislation referred to in paragraph\u00a0195 of the present judgment is applicable constitute electronic communications services within the meaning of Directive 2002/58, which is for the referring court to verify.\n204\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Directive 2002/58 covers electronic communications services that satisfy the conditions set out in Article\u00a02(c) of Directive 2002/21, to which Article\u00a02 of Directive 2002/58 refers and which defines an electronic communications service as \u2018a service normally provided for remuneration which consists wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals on electronic communications networks, including telecommunications services and transmission services in networks used for broadcasting\u2019. As regards information society services, such as those referred to in paragraphs\u00a0197 and 198 of the present judgment and covered by Directive 2000/31, they are electronic communications services to the extent that they consist wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals on electronic communications networks (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0June 2019, \nSkype Communications\n, C-142/18, EU:C:2019:460, paragraphs\u00a047 and 48).\n205\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, Internet access services, which appear to be covered by the national legislation referred to in paragraph\u00a0195 of the present judgment, constitute electronic communications services within the meaning of Directive 2002/21, as is confirmed by recital\u00a010 of that directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0June 2019, \nSkype Communications\n, C-142/18, EU:C:2019:460, paragraph\u00a037). That is also the case for web-based email services, which, it appears, could conceivably also fall under that national legislation, since, on a technical level, they also involve wholly or mainly the conveyance of signals on electronic communications networks (see, to that effect, judgment of 13\u00a0June 2019, \nGoogle\n, C-193/18, EU:C:2019:498, paragraphs\u00a035 and 38).\n206\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the requirements resulting from Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, it is appropriate to refer back to all of the findings and assessments made in the context of the answer given to question\u00a01 in each of Cases C-511/18 and C-512/18 and to questions\u00a01 and 2 in Case C-520/18.\n207\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the requirements stemming from Regulation 2016/679, it should be noted that the purpose of that regulation is, inter alia, as is apparent from recital\u00a010 thereof, to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union and, to that end, to ensure a consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of such natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0101).\n208\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, any processing of personal data must, subject to the derogations permitted in Article\u00a023 of Regulation 2016/679, observe the principles governing the processing of personal data and the rights of the person concerned set out, respectively, in Chapters\u00a0II and III of that regulation. In particular, any processing of personal data must, first, comply with the principles set out in Article\u00a05 of that regulation and, second, satisfy the lawfulness conditions listed in Article\u00a06 of that regulation (see, by analogy, with regard to Directive 95/46, judgment of 30\u00a0May 2013, \nWorten\n, C-342/12, EU:C:2013:355, paragraph\u00a033 and the case-law cited).\n209\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard, more specifically, to Article\u00a023(1) of Regulation 2016/679, that provision, much like Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, allows Member States to restrict, for the purposes of the objectives that it provides for and by means of legislative measures, the scope of the obligations and rights that are referred to therein \u2018when such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard\u2019 the objective pursued. Any legislative measure adopted on that basis must, in particular, comply with the specific requirements set out in Article\u00a023(2) of that regulation.\n210\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, Article\u00a023(1) and (2) of Regulation 2016/679 cannot be interpreted as being capable of conferring on Member States the power to undermine respect for private life, disregarding Article\u00a07 of the Charter, or any of the other guarantees enshrined therein (see, by analogy, with regard to Directive 95/46, judgment of 20\u00a0May 2003, \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01, EU:C:2003:294, paragraph\u00a091). In particular, as is the case for Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, the power conferred on Member States by Article\u00a023(1) of Regulation 2016/679 may be exercised only in accordance with the requirement of proportionality, according to which derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (see, by analogy, with regard to Directive 95/46, judgment of 7\u00a0November 2013, \nIPI\n, C-473/12, EU:C:2013:715, paragraph\u00a039 and the case-law cited).\n211\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the findings and assessments made in the context of the answer given to question\u00a01 in each of Cases C-511/18 and C-512/18 and to questions\u00a01 and 2 in Case C-520/18 apply, \nmutatis mutandis\n, to Article\u00a023 of Regulation 2016/679.\n212\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to question\u00a02 in Case C-512/18 is that Directive 2000/31 must be interpreted as not being applicable in the field of the protection of the confidentiality of communications and of natural persons as regards the processing of personal data in the context of information society services, such protection being governed by Directive 2002/58 or by Regulation 2016/679, as appropriate. Article\u00a023(1) of Regulation 2016/679, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which requires that providers of access to online public communication services and hosting service providers retain, generally and indiscriminately, inter alia, personal data relating to those services.\n\u00a0\nQuestion\n\u00a0\n3 in Case C\n-\n520/18\n213\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By question\u00a03 in Case C-520/18, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether a national court may apply a provision of national law empowering it to limit the temporal effects of a declaration of illegality which it is bound to make under that law in respect of national legislation imposing on providers of electronic communications services\u00a0\u2013 with a view to, inter alia, pursuing the objectives of safeguarding national security and combating crime\u00a0\u2013 an obligation requiring the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data, owing to the fact that that legislation is incompatible with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter.\n214\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principle of the primacy of EU law establishes the pre-eminence of EU law over the law of the Member States. That principle therefore requires all Member State bodies to give full effect to the various EU provisions, and the law of the Member States may not undermine the effect accorded to those various provisions in the territory of those States (judgments of 15\u00a0July 1964, \nCosta\n, 6/64, EU:C:1964:66, pp.\u00a0593 and 594, and of 19\u00a0November 2019, \nA.\u00a0K. and Others (Independence of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court)\n, C-585/18, C-624/18 and C-625/18, EU:C:2019:982, paragraphs\u00a0157 and 158 and the case-law cited).\n215\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the primacy principle, where it is unable to interpret national law in compliance with the requirements of EU law, the national court which is called upon within the exercise of its jurisdiction to apply provisions of EU law is under a duty to give full effect to those provisions, if necessary refusing of its own motion to apply any conflicting provision of national legislation, even if adopted subsequently, and it is not necessary for that court to request or await the prior setting aside of such provision by legislative or other constitutional means (judgments of 22\u00a0June 2010, \nMelki and Abdeli\n, C-188/10 and C-189/10, EU:C:2010:363, paragraph\u00a043 and the case-law cited; of 24\u00a0June 2019, \nPop\u0142awski\n, C-573/17, EU:C:2019:530, paragraph\u00a058; and of 19\u00a0November 2019, \nA.\u00a0K. and Others (Independence of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court)\n, C-585/18, C-624/18 and C-625/18, EU:C:2019:982, paragraph\u00a0160).\n216\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only the Court may, in exceptional cases, on the basis of overriding considerations of legal certainty, allow the temporary suspension of the ousting effect of a rule of EU law with respect to national law that is contrary thereto. Such a restriction on the temporal effects of the interpretation of that law, made by the Court, may be granted only in the actual judgment ruling upon the interpretation requested (see, to that effect, judgments of 23\u00a0October 2012, \nNelson and Others\n, C-581/10 and C-629/10, EU:C:2012:657, paragraphs\u00a089 and 91; of 23\u00a0April 2020, \nHerst\n, C-401/18, EU:C:2020:295, paragraphs\u00a056 and 57; and of 25\u00a0June 2020, \nA and Others (Wind turbines at Aalter and Nevele)\n, C-24/19, EU:C:2020:503, paragraph\u00a084 and the case-law cited).\n217\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The primacy and uniform application of EU law would be undermined if national courts had the power to give provisions of national law primacy in relation to EU law contravened by those provisions, even temporarily (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0July 2019, \nInter-Environnement Wallonie and Bond Beter Leefmilieu Vlaanderen\n, C-411/17, EU:C:2019:622, paragraph\u00a0177 and the case-law cited).\n218\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the Court has held, in a case concerning the lawfulness of measures adopted in breach of the obligation under EU law to conduct a prior assessment of the impact of a project on the environment and on a protected site, that if domestic law allows it, a national court may, by way of exception, maintain the effects of such measures where such maintenance is justified by overriding considerations relating to the need to nullify a genuine and serious threat of interruption in the electricity supply in the Member State concerned, which cannot be remedied by any other means or alternatives, particularly in the context of the internal market, and continues only for as long as is strictly necessary to remedy the breach (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0July 2019, \nInter-Environnement Wallonie and Bond Beter Leefmilieu Vlaanderen\n, C-411/17, EU:C:2019:622, paragraphs\u00a0175, 176, 179 and 181).\n219\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, unlike a breach of a procedural obligation such as the prior assessment of the impact of a project in the specific field of environmental protection, a failure to comply with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, cannot be remedied by a procedure comparable to the procedure referred to in the preceding paragraph. Maintaining the effects of national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings would mean that the legislation would continue to impose on providers of electronic communications services obligations which are contrary to EU law and which seriously interfere with the fundamental rights of the persons whose data has been retained.\n220\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the referring court cannot apply a provision of national law empowering it to limit the temporal effects of a declaration of illegality which it is bound to make under that law in respect of the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings.\n221\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, in their observations submitted to the Court, VZ, WY and XX contend that question\u00a03 implicitly yet necessarily asks whether EU law precludes the use, in criminal proceedings, of information and evidence obtained as a result of the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data in breach of that law.\n222\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, and in order to give a useful answer to the referring court, it should be recalled that, as EU law currently stands, it is, in principle, for national law alone to determine the rules relating to the admissibility and assessment, in criminal proceedings against persons suspected of having committed serious criminal offences, of information and evidence obtained by such retention of data contrary to EU law.\n223\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has consistently held that, in the absence of EU rules on the matter, it is for the national legal order of each Member State to establish, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy, procedural rules for actions intended to safeguard the rights that individuals derive from EU law, provided, however, that those rules are no less favourable than the rules governing similar domestic actions (the principle of equivalence) and do not render impossible in practice or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by EU law (the principle of effectiveness) (see, to that effect, judgments of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nT\u00e2r\u015fia\n, C-69/14, EU:C:2015:662, paragraphs\u00a026 and 27; of 24\u00a0October 2018, \nXC and Others\n, C-234/17, EU:C:2018:853, paragraphs\u00a021 and 22 and the case-law cited; and of 19\u00a0December 2019, \nDeutsche Umwelthilfe\n, C-752/18, EU:C:2019:1114, paragraph\u00a033).\n224\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the principle of equivalence, it is for the national court hearing criminal proceedings based on information or evidence obtained in contravention of the requirements stemming from Directive 2002/58 to determine whether national law governing those proceedings lays down less favourable rules on the admissibility and use of such information and evidence than those governing information and evidence obtained in breach of domestic law.\n225\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the principle of effectiveness, it should be noted that the objective of national rules on the admissibility and use of information and evidence is, in accordance with the choices made by national law, to prevent information and evidence obtained unlawfully from unduly prejudicing a person who is suspected of having committed criminal offences. That objective may be achieved under national law not only by prohibiting the use of such information and evidence, but also by means of national rules and practices governing the assessment and weighting of such material, or by factoring in whether that material is unlawful when determining the sentence.\n226\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, it is apparent from the Court\u2019s case-law that in deciding whether to exclude information and evidence obtained in contravention of the requirements of EU law, regard must be had, in particular, to the risk of breach of the adversarial principle and, therefore, the right to a fair trial entailed by the admissibility of such information and evidence (see, to that effect, judgment of 10\u00a0April 2003, \nSteffensen\n, C-276/01, EU:C:2003:228, paragraphs\u00a076 and 77). If a court takes the view that a party is not in a position to comment effectively on evidence pertaining to a field of which the judges have no knowledge and is likely to have a preponderant influence on the findings of fact, it must find an infringement of the right to a fair trial and exclude that evidence to avoid such an infringement (see, to that effect, judgment of 10\u00a0April 2003, \nSteffensen\n, C-276/01, EU:C:2003:228, paragraphs\u00a078 and 79).\n227\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the principle of effectiveness requires national criminal courts to disregard information and evidence obtained by means of the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data in breach of EU law, in the context of criminal proceedings against persons suspected of having committed criminal offences, where those persons are not in a position to comment effectively on that information and that evidence and they pertain to a field of which the judges have no knowledge and are likely to have a preponderant influence on the findings of fact.\n228\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to question\u00a03 in Case C-520/18 is that a national court may not apply a provision of national law empowering it to limit the temporal effects of a declaration of illegality, which it is bound to make under that law, in respect of national legislation imposing on providers of electronic communications services\u00a0\u2013 with a view to, inter alia, safeguarding national security and combating crime\u00a0\u2013 an obligation requiring the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data that is incompatible with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter. Article\u00a015(1), interpreted in the light of the principle of effectiveness, requires national criminal courts to disregard information and evidence obtained by means of the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data in breach of EU law, in the context of criminal proceedings against persons suspected of having committed criminal offences, where those persons are not in a position to comment effectively on that information and that evidence and they pertain to a field of which the judges have no knowledge and are likely to have a preponderant influence on the findings of fact.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n229\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the actions pending before the national courts, the decision on costs is a matter for those courts.

In addition, he asked to be provided with a copy of the documents, namely emails and database extracts containing, inter alia, his data, \u2018in a standard technical format\u2019.\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In response to that request, CRIF sent the applicant in the main proceedings, in summary form, the list of his personal data undergoing processing.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Being of the view that CRIF should have sent him a copy of all the documents containing his data, such as emails and database extracts, the applicant in the main proceedings lodged a complaint with DSB.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 11\u00a0September 2019, DSB rejected that complaint, taking the view that CRIF had not in any way infringed the right of access of the applicant in the main proceedings to his personal data.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court, hearing the action brought by the applicant in the main proceedings against that decision, is uncertain as to the scope of the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR. It wonders in particular whether the obligation laid down in that provision to provide a \u2018copy\u2019 of the personal data is fulfilled where the controller transmits the personal data in the form of a summary table or whether that obligation also entails the transmission of document extracts or entire documents, as well as database extracts, in which those data are reproduced.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, the referring court asks whether the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR merely defines the form in which the right of access to information referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of that regulation must be guaranteed, or whether that first provision enshrines an autonomous right of the data subject to access information relating to the context in which that person\u2019s data are processed, in the form of copies of document extracts, or entire documents or database extracts which contain, inter alia, those data.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the referring court asks whether the term \u2018information\u2019, which appears in the third sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, includes the information referred to in Article\u00a015(1)(a) to (h) of that regulation, or even additional information such as metadata related to the data, or whether it covers only the \u2018personal data undergoing processing\u2019 referred to in the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of that regulation.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court, Austria) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the term \u201ccopy\u201d in Article\u00a015(3) of [the GDPR] to be interpreted as meaning a photocopy, a facsimile or an electronic copy of [an] (electronic) item of data, or does it also cover an \u201c\nAbschrift\n\u201d, a \u201cdouble\u201d (\u201c\nduplicata\n\u201d) or a \u201ctranscript\u201d, in line with the understanding of the term in German, French and English dictionaries?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, according to which \u201cthe controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing\u201d, to be interpreted as affording a general right for a data subject to obtain a copy of\u00a0\u2013 also\u00a0\u2013 entire documents in which the personal data of that data subject are processed, or to receive a copy of a database extract if the personal data are processed in such a database, or does the data subject have a right\u00a0\u2013 only\u00a0\u2013 to an exact reproduction of the personal data about which information is to be provided pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that Question 2 is answered to the effect that the data subject has a right only to an exact reproduction of the personal data about which information is to be provided pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR, is the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR to be interpreted as meaning that, depending on the nature of the data processed (for example in relation to the diagnoses, examination results and assessments mentioned in recital\u00a063 or documents in relation to an examination within the meaning of the judgment of the Court of Justice of 20\u00a0December 2017, \nNowak\n,\n\u00a0\nC-434/16, EU:C:2017:994) and the transparency requirement in Article\u00a012(1) of the GDPR, it may nevertheless be necessary in individual cases to make text passages or entire documents available to the data subject?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the term \u201cinformation\u201d which, pursuant to the third sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, \u201cwhere the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject,\u00a0\u2026 shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form\u201d, to be interpreted as referring solely to the \u201cpersonal data undergoing processing\u201d mentioned in the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR?\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question 4 is answered in the negative: Is the term \u201cinformation\u201d which, pursuant to the third sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, \u201cwhere the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject,\u00a0\u2026 shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form\u201d to be interpreted as also referring to the information pursuant to Article\u00a015(1)(a) to (h) of the GDPR?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question 4a also is answered in the negative: Is the term \u201cinformation\u201d which, pursuant to the third sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, \u201cwhere the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject,\u00a0\u2026 shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form\u201d to be interpreted as referring, beyond the \u201cpersonal data undergoing processing\u201d and the information pursuant to Article\u00a015(1)(a) to (h) of the GDPR, to associated metadata, for example?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first, second and third questions referred\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first three questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, read in the light of the transparency requirement laid down in Article\u00a012(1) of that regulation, must be interpreted as meaning that the right to obtain a copy of the personal data undergoing processing means that the data subject must be given not only a copy of those data, but also a copy of extracts from documents or even entire documents or extracts from databases which contain, inter alia, those data. That court is uncertain, in particular, of the extent of that right.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be recalled that, according to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary to consider not only its wording, by reference to its usual meaning in everyday language, but also the context in which it occurs and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part (see, to that effect, judgments of 2\u00a0December 2021, \nVodafone Kabel Deutschland\n, C-484/20, EU:C:2021:975, paragraph\u00a019 and the case-law cited, and of 7\u00a0September 2022, \nStaatssecretaris van Justitie en Veiligheid (Nature of the right of residence under Article\u00a020 TFEU)\n, C-624/20, EU:C:2022:639, paragraph\u00a028).\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the wording of the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, that provision states that the controller \u2018shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing\u2019.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the GDPR does not contain a definition of the term \u2018copy\u2019 thus used, account must be taken of the usual meaning of that term, which refers, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a030 of his Opinion, to the faithful reproduction or transcription of an original, with the result that a purely general description of the data undergoing processing or a reference to categories of personal data does not correspond to that definition. Furthermore, it is apparent from the wording of the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of that regulation that the disclosure obligation relates to the personal data undergoing the processing in question.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR defines the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 as \u2018any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019 and specifies that \u2018an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person\u2019.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use of the expression \u2018any information\u2019 in the definition of the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 in that provision reflects the aim of the EU legislature to assign a wide scope to that concept, which potentially encompasses all kinds of information, not only objective but also subjective, in the form of opinions and assessments, provided that it \u2018relates\u2019 to the data subject (see, by analogy, judgment of 20\u00a0December 2017, \nNowak\n, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraph\u00a034).\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it has been held that information relates to an identified or identifiable natural person where, by reason of its content, purpose or effect, it is linked to an identifiable person (see, to that effect, judgment of 20\u00a0December 2017, \nNowak\n, C-434/16, EU:C:2017:994, paragraph\u00a035).\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the \u2018identifiable\u2019 nature of a natural person, recital\u00a026 of the GDPR states that account should be taken of \u2018all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly\u2019.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in points\u00a036 to 39 of his Opinion, the broad definition of the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 covers not only data collected and stored by the controller, but also includes all information resulting from the processing of personal data relating to an identified or identifiable person, such as the assessment of that person\u2019s creditworthiness or his or her ability to pay.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, it should also be added that the EU legislature intended to give the concept of \u2018processing\u2019, as defined in Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR, a broad scope by using a non-exhaustive list of operations (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0February 2022, \nValsts ie\u0146\u0113mumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)\n, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraph\u00a035).\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it follows from the literal analysis of the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR that that provision confers on the data subject the right to obtain a faithful reproduction of his or her personal data, understood in a broad sense, that are subject to operations that can be classified as processing carried out by the controller.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, it must be held that the wording of that provision does not, in itself, enable an answer to be given to the first three questions in so far as it contains no indication regarding any right to obtain not only a copy of the personal data undergoing processing, but also a copy of extracts from documents or even entire documents or extracts from databases which contain, inter alia, those data.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the context of which the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR forms part, it should be noted that Article\u00a015 of the GDPR, which is entitled \u2018Right of access by the data subject\u2019, defines, in paragraph\u00a01 thereof, the subject matter and scope of the data subject\u2019s right of access and enshrines that data subject\u2019s right to obtain from the controller access to his or her personal data and the information referred to in points (a) to (h) of that paragraph.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR sets out the practical arrangements for the fulfilment of the controller\u2019s obligation, specifying, inter alia, in its first sentence, the form in which that controller must provide the \u2018personal data undergoing processing\u2019, namely in the form of a \u2018copy\u2019. In addition, the third sentence of that paragraph states that the information is to be provided in a commonly used electronic form where the request is made by electronic means, unless otherwise requested by the data subject.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a result, Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR cannot be interpreted as establishing a separate right from that provided for in Article\u00a015(1). Moreover, as the European Commission noted in its written observations, the term \u2018copy\u2019 does not relate to a document as such, but to the personal data which it contains and which must be complete. The copy must therefore contain all the personal data undergoing processing.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objectives pursued by Article\u00a015 of the GDPR, it should be noted that the purpose of the GDPR, as stated in recital\u00a011 thereof, is to strengthen and set out in detail the rights of data subjects. Article\u00a015 of that regulation provides, in that regard, for a right to obtain a copy, unlike the second indent of Article\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L\u00a0281, p.\u00a031), which merely required \u2018communication\u00a0\u2026 in an intelligible form of the data undergoing processing\u2019. Recital\u00a063 of the GDPR states that \u2018a data subject should have the right of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her, and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing\u2019.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the right of access provided for in Article\u00a015 of the GDPR must enable the data subject to ensure that the personal data relating to him or her are correct and that they are processed in a lawful manner (see, to that effect, judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Information regarding the recipients of personal data)\n, C-154/21, EU:C:2023:3, paragraph\u00a037 and the case-law cited).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, that right of access is necessary to enable the data subject to exercise, depending on the circumstances, his or her right to rectification, right to erasure (\u2018right to be forgotten\u2019) or right to restriction of processing, conferred, respectively, by Articles\u00a016, 17 and 18 of the GDPR, as well as the data subject\u2019s right to object to his or her personal data being processed, laid down in Article\u00a021 of the GDPR, and right of action where he or she suffers damage, laid down in Articles\u00a079 and 82 of the GDPR (judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Information regarding the recipients of personal data)\n, C-154/21, EU:C:2023:3, paragraph\u00a038 and the case-law cited).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that recital\u00a060 of the GDPR states that the principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes, it being stressed that the controller should provide any other information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in accordance with the principle of transparency, alluded to by the referring court, to which recital\u00a058 of the GDPR refers and which is expressly enshrined in Article\u00a012(1) of that regulation, any information sent to the data subject must be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and formulated in clear and plain language.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General stated in points\u00a054 and 55 of his Opinion, it follows from that provision that the controller is obliged to take appropriate measures to provide the data subject with all the information referred to, inter alia, in Article\u00a015 of the GDPR, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using plain and clear language, and that the information must be provided in writing or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means, unless the data subject requests that it be provided orally. The purpose of that provision, which is an expression of the principle of transparency, is to ensure that the data subject is able fully to understand the information sent to him or her.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the copy of the personal data undergoing processing, which the controller must provide pursuant to the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, must have all the characteristics necessary for the data subject effectively to exercise his or her rights under that regulation and must, consequently, reproduce those data fully and faithfully.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation corresponds to the objective of the GDPR, which seeks, inter alia, as is apparent from recital\u00a010 thereof, to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union and, to that end, to ensure a consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of such natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union (see, to that effect, judgment of 9\u00a0February 2023, \nX-FAB Dresden\n, C-453/21, EU:C:2023:79, paragraph\u00a025 and the case-law cited).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure that the information thus provided is easy to understand, as required by Article\u00a012(1) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with recital\u00a058 of that regulation, the reproduction of extracts from documents or even entire documents or extracts from databases which contain, inter alia, the personal data undergoing processing may prove to be essential, as the Advocate General observed in points\u00a057 and 58 of his Opinion, where the contextualisation of the data processed is necessary in order to ensure the data are intelligible.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, where personal data are generated from other data or where such data result from empty fields, that is to say, where there is an absence of information which provides information about the data subject, the context in which the data are processed is an essential element in enabling the data subject to have transparent access and an intelligible presentation of those data.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, in accordance with Article\u00a015(4) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with recital\u00a063 of that regulation, the right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph\u00a03 of that article must not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual property, and in particular the copyright protecting the software.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, as the Advocate General stated in point\u00a061 of his Opinion, in the event of conflict between, on the one hand, exercising the right of full and complete access to personal data and, on the other hand, the rights and freedoms of others, a balance will have to be struck between the rights in question. Wherever possible, means of communicating personal data that do not infringe the rights or freedoms of others should be chosen, bearing in mind that, as follows from recital\u00a063 of the GDPR, \u2018the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject\u2019.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first, second and third questions referred is that the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the right to obtain from the controller a copy of the personal data undergoing processing means that the data subject must be given a faithful and intelligible reproduction of all those data. That right entails the right to obtain copies of extracts from documents or even entire documents or extracts from databases which contain, inter alia, those data, if the provision of such a copy is essential in order to enable the data subject to exercise effectively the rights conferred on him or her by that regulation, bearing in mind that account must be taken, in that regard, of the rights and freedoms of others.\n\u00a0\nThe fourth question referred\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the fourth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the third sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018information\u2019 to which it refers relates exclusively to the personal data of which the controller must provide a copy pursuant to the first sentence of that paragraph, or whether it also refers to all the information referred to in paragraph\u00a01 of that article, or even covers elements going beyond that information, such as metadata.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As was pointed out in paragraph\u00a019 above, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary to consider not only its wording but also the context in which it occurs and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it forms part.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, although the third sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR merely states that, \u2018where the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form\u2019, without specifying what is to be understood by the term \u2018information\u2019, the first sentence of that paragraph states that \u2018the controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing\u2019.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it follows from the context of the third sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR that the \u2018information\u2019 to which it refers necessarily corresponds to the personal data of which the controller must provide a copy in accordance with the first sentence of that paragraph.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such an interpretation is confirmed by the objectives pursued by Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, which are, as recalled in paragraph\u00a031 above, to define the practical arrangements for the fulfilment of the controller\u2019s obligation to provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. Consequently, that provision does not create a right separate from that which the data subject enjoys to obtain a faithful and intelligible reproduction of those data, enabling him or her effectively to exercise the rights conferred on him or her by that regulation.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that no provision of that regulation establishes a difference in treatment of an application according to the form in which it is submitted, with the result that the scope of the right to obtain a copy cannot vary according to that form.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it should also be noted that, in accordance with Article\u00a012(3) of the GDPR, where the request has been made by electronic means, the information referred to in Article\u00a015, including that referred to in Article\u00a015(1)(a) to (h), is to be provided by electronic means, unless otherwise indicated by the data subject.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the fourth question referred is that the third sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018information\u2019 to which it refers relates exclusively to the personal data of which the controller must provide a copy pursuant to the first sentence of that paragraph.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation),\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the right to obtain from the controller a copy of the personal data undergoing processing means that the data subject must be given a faithful and intelligible reproduction of all those data. That right entails the right to obtain copies of extracts from documents or even entire documents or extracts from databases which contain, inter alia, those data, if the provision of such a copy is essential in order to enable the data subject to exercise effectively the rights conferred on him or her by that regulation, bearing in mind that account must be taken, in that regard, of the rights and freedoms of others.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe third sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the concept of \u2018information\u2019 to which it refers relates exclusively to the personal data of which the controller must provide a copy pursuant to the first sentence of that paragraph."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L\u00a0281, p.\u00a031).\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The request has been made in proceedings between the Institut professionnel des agents immobiliers (IPI) (Belgian Institute of Estate Agents) on the one hand and Mr Englebert, Immo 9 SPRL and Mr Francotte on the other concerning alleged breaches of the national rules on the exercise of the profession of estate agent.\n\u00a0\nLegal context\n\u00a0\nEuropean Union law\n\u00a0Directive 95/46\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals 3, 8, 10, 37 and 43 in the preamble to Directive 95/46 read as follows:\n\u2018(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the establishment and functioning of an internal market in which, in accordance with Article 7a of the Treaty, the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured require not only that personal data should be able to flow freely from one Member State to another, but also that the fundamental rights of individuals should be safeguarded;\n\u2026 \n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas, in order to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of such data must be equivalent in all Member States; \u2026\n\u2026 \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the object of the national laws on the processing of personal data is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, which is recognised both in Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in the general principles of Community law; whereas, for that reason, the approximation of those laws must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community;\n\u2026\n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the processing of personal data for purposes of journalism or for purposes of literary [or] artistic expression, in particular in the audiovisual field, should qualify for exemption from the requirements of certain provisions of this Directive in so far as this is necessary to reconcile the fundamental rights of individuals with freedom of information \u2026\n\u2026\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas restrictions on the rights of access and information and on certain obligations of the controller may similarly be imposed by Member States in so far as they are necessary to safeguard, for example, national security, defence, public safety, or important economic or financial interests of a Member State or the Union, as well as criminal investigations and prosecutions and action in respect of breaches of ethics in the regulated professions; \u2026\u2019\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1(1) of Directive 95/46 states:\n\u2018In accordance with this Directive, Member States shall protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data.\u2019\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 2(a) and (d) of Directive 95/46 states: \n\u2018For the purpose of this

determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; \u2026\u2019\n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 9 of Directive 95/46 states:\n\u2018Member States shall provide for exemptions or derogations from the provisions of this Chapter, Chapter IV and Chapter VI for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression only if they are necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression.\u2019\n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section IV of Directive 95/46, entitled \u2018Information to be given to the data subject\u2019, comprises Articles 10 and 11 which govern situations where the data have been collected from the data subject and where the data have not been obtained from the data subject respectively.\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 10 of Directive 95/46 states:\n\u2018Member States shall provide that the controller or his representative must provide a data subject from whom data relating to himself are collected with at least the following information, except where he already has it:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the identity of the controller and of his representative, if any;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the purposes of the processing for which the data are intended;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any further

right to rectify the data concerning him\nin so far as such further information is necessary, having regard to the specific circumstances in which the data are processed, to guarantee fair processing in respect of the data subject.\u2019\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 11 of the directive states that, where the data have not been obtained from the data subject, Member States are to provide that the controller or his representative must at the time of undertaking the recording of personal data or, if a disclosure to a third party is envisaged, no later than the time when the data are first disclosed provide the data subject with at least the information set out in that article, except where he already has it.\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 1 of Article 13 of Directive 95/46, which is entitled \u2018Exemptions and restrictions\u2019, provides: \n\u2018Member States may adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope of the obligations and

personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ 2002 L\u00a0201, p.\u00a037) provides in Article 15(1):\n\u2018Member States may adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope of the rights and obligations provided for in Article 5, Article 6, Article 8(1), (2), (3) and (4), and Article 9 of this Directive when such restriction constitutes a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society to safeguard national security (i.e. State security), defence, public security, and the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of unauthorised use of the electronic communication system, as referred to in Article 13(1) of Directive [95/46]. \u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\nBelgian law\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Law of 8 December 1992 on the protection of privacy in relation to the processing of personal data (\nMoniteur belge\n, 18 March 1993, p.\u00a05801) was amended by the Law of 11 December 1998 implementing Directive 95/46/EC (\nMoniteur belge\n, 3 February 1999, p.\u00a03049) (\u2018the 1992 Law\u2019). Article 9 of the 1992 Law, paragraphs 1 and 2 of which correspond to Articles 10 and 11 of the directive respectively, imposes an obligation to inform the data subject.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 3(3) to (7) of the 1992 Law lays down exceptions and restrictions to that obligation to inform, inter alia, where the processing of personal data is carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression and where it is managed by the S\u00fbret\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9tat (State security office), by the Service g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du renseignement et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (General intelligence and security service of the armed forces), by public authorities for the purpose of exercising their judicial police duties, by the police services for the purpose of exercising their administrative police duties, or by the European Centre for Missing and Sexually Abused Children.\n\u00a0\nThe facts in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IPI, established by Royal Decree of 17 February 1995, is, inter alia, responsible for ensuring compliance with the conditions of access to and the proper practice of the profession of estate agent. It may, for that purpose, be a party to legal proceedings and report to the judicial authorities any infringement of the applicable rules. IPI is authorised to use the services of private detectives in order to carry out its duties.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the course of its activity, IPI asked the Tribunal de commerce de Charleroi (Charleroi Commercial Court) to declare that Mr Englebert, Immo 9 SPRL and Mr Francotte had acted contrary to those rules and to order Mr Englebert and Mr\u00a0Francotte to cease various estate agency activities. IPI based its action on facts gathered by private detectives whom it had used.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal de commerce de Charleroi raised the question of the value to be attributed to the evidence furnished by the private detectives, given the possibility that it had been obtained without respecting the requirements of the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and, consequently, in breach of the 1992 Law. That court stated that, according to IPI, the implementation of that law, which requires the data subject to be informed of the detective\u2019s investigation in advance or, where the data is collected from third parties, at the time of undertaking the recording of the data at issue, makes it impossible for a private detective to carry on his activities. The Tribunal de commerce de Charleroi was uncertain whether, by not extending to private detectives the exceptions to that obligation to inform which apply to other professional categories or bodies working in the public interest, Article 3(3) to (7) of the 1992 Law gives rise to unequal treatment contrary to the Constitution. It therefore decided to refer the question to the Cour constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court).\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court considers that it must be determined whether the 1992 Law, by not laying down exceptions for private detectives comparable to those referred to in Article 13(1)(d) and (g) of Directive 95/46, correctly implements that provision. It states that Article 3(3) to (7) of the 1992 Law gives rise to a difference in treatment between, on the one hand, persons pursuing a journalistic, artistic or literary activity, security and police services and the European Centre for Missing and Sexually Abused Children and, on the other, persons exercising the profession of private detective, in that only the former are exempt from the obligation to inform laid down in Article 9 of the 1992 Law.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, that exception can be explained in terms of the activities exercised, which are related to public information or to cultural life, to the maintenance of security and public order, and to the defence of the fundamental rights of the most vulnerable.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Private detectives are stated to be in a different situation. The referring court notes that, even though their profession is regulated by a 1991 law which establishes the structure of the profession and makes its exercise subject to the authorisation of the Minister for the Interior, their activity is unconnected with the protection of those fundamental rights and general interests and generally relates to the protection of private interests.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Cour constitutionnelle notes that, although Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46 seems to grant Member States some freedom as to whether or not to adopt the exceptions in question, nevertheless a doubt exists in view of the complete harmonisation achieved, in principle, by that directive.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Cour constitutionnelle decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article 13(1)(g) \nin fine \nof Directive [95/46] to be interpreted as meaning that it leaves the Member States free to choose whether or not to provide for an exception to the immediate obligation to inform set out in Article 11(1) if this is necessary in order to protect the rights and freedoms of others, or are the Member States subject to restrictions in this matter?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do the professional activities of private detectives, governed by national law and exercised in the service of authorities authorised to report to the judicial authorities any infringement of the provisions protecting a professional title and organising a profession, come, depending on the circumstances, within the exception referred to in Article 13(1)(d) and (g) \nin fine\n of [Directive\u00a095/46]?\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event of a negative reply to Question 2, is Article 13(1)(d) and (g) \nin fine\n of [Directive 95/46] compatible with Article 6(3) [TEU], more specifically with the principle of equality and non-discrimination?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nPreliminary observation\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its first question, the referring court refers to an obligation to inform the data subject immediately which is referred to in Article 11 of Directive 95/46.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must, however, be observed that that provision, which concerns data which have not been obtained from the data subject, provides for information to be provided to the data subject not at the time when the data are obtained but at a later stage. By contrast, Article 10 of Directive 95/46, which refers to the collection of data from the data subject, provides for the data subject to be informed at the time the data are collected (see, to that effect, Case C-553/07 \nRijkeboer \n[2009] ECR I-3889, paragraph 68). The immediate nature of the provision of information to the data subject thus comes not from Article 11 of Directive 95/46, mentioned by the referring court, but from Article 10.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards investigations carried out by a private detective, it is apparent from the order for reference that he may need to collect data either directly from the data subject or indirectly, inter alia, from third parties. It must, therefore, be stated that both Article 10 and Article 11(1) of Directive 95/46 may, depending on the circumstances, be relevant for such investigations.\n\u00a0\nQuestions 1 and 2\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first two questions, which should be considered together, the referring court asks, in essence, first, whether Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that Member States have the option, or the obligation, to transpose into their national law the exceptions which that article lays down to the obligation to inform data subjects of the processing of their personal data and, secondly, whether the activity of a private detective acting for a professional body in order to investigate breaches of ethics of a regulated profession, in this case that of estate agent, falls within the scope of Article 13(1)(d) or (g).\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset, it must be stated that data such as those which, according to the referring court, are collected by the private detectives in the main proceedings relate to persons acting as estate agents and concern identified or identifiable natural persons. They are therefore personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46. Their collection, storage and transmission by a regulated body such as IPI or by the private detectives acting for it therefore represent the \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article 2(b) of Directive 95/46 (see Case C-524/06 \nHuber\n [2008] ECR I-9705, paragraph 43).\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to reply to the question, it must be examined, in the first place, whether, pursuant to Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46, Member States have the option to provide, or are obliged to provide, for one or more of the exceptions listed in that article to the obligation to inform the data subject of the processing of personal data.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from recitals 3, 8 and 10 of Directive 95/46 that the European Union legislature sought to facilitate the free movement of personal data by the approximation of the laws of the Member States while safeguarding the fundamental rights of individuals, in particular the right to privacy, and ensuring a high level of protection in the European Union. Article 1 of the directive thus requires the Member States to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data (\nHuber\n, paragraph 47, and Joined Cases C-468/10 and C-469/10 \nASNEF and FECEMD\n [2011] ECR I-12181, paragraph 25).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For that purpose, Directive 95/46 contains, in Articles 10 and 11, obligations to inform the data subject of the processing of his personal data while providing, in Article 13(1), that the Member States may adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope of those obligations where such a measure is necessary for the purposes set out in Article 13(1)(a) to (g).\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court raises the question of the leeway Member States have in view of the legislature\u2019s objective of harmonisation, as set out in recital 8 of the directive, which is intended to ensure that the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data is equivalent in all Member States.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that the Court has previously held that Directive 95/46 amounts to harmonisation which is generally complete (see Case C-101/01 \nLindqvist\n [2003] ECR I-12971, paragraphs 95 and 96, and \nHuber\n, paragraphs 50 and 51). However, the Court has also found that the provisions of Directive 95/46 are necessarily relatively general given that it has to be applied to a large number of very different situations, and that the directive includes rules with a degree of flexibility and, in many instances, leaves to the Member States the task of deciding the details or choosing between options (\nLindqvist\n, paragraph 83).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46, it is clear from its wording, and in particular from the use of the words \u2018Member States may\u2019, that that provision does not oblige the Member States to lay down in their national law exceptions for the purposes listed in Article 13(1)(a) to (g) but, on the contrary, the legislature intended to give them the freedom to decide whether, and if so for what purposes, they wish to take legislative measures aimed at limiting, inter alia, the extent of the obligations to inform the data subject. Furthermore, it is also apparent from the wording of Article 13(1) that the Member States may lay down such measures only when they are necessary. The requirement that the measures be \u2018necessary\u2019 is thus a precondition for the application of the option granted to Member States by Article 13(1), and does not mean that they are required to adopt the exceptions at issue in all cases where that condition is satisfied.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is, first, supported by the wording of recital 43 of Directive\u00a095/46, according to which restrictions on the rights of information \u2018may \u2026 be imposed by Member States in so far as they are necessary to safeguard\u2019 those purposes. That interpretation is, next, confirmed by a comparison of, on the one hand, the wording of Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46 and, on the other hand, Article 9 and recital 37 of the directive, which for their part clearly impose an obligation on the Member States to provide for exceptions and derogations for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression in so far as they are necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is also confirmed by the Court\u2019s analysis in Case C-275/06 \nPromusicae\n [2008] ECR I-271 of Article 15(1) of the directive on privacy and electronic communications, which is formulated in similar terms to Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46 and, furthermore, expressly refers to that article.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court found, first, that Article 15(1) gives Member States the possibility of providing for exceptions to the obligation of principle to ensure the confidentiality of personal data (\nPromusicae\n, paragraph 50).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards one of those exceptions, the Court then held that Article 15(1) cannot, however, be interpreted as compelling the Member States, in the situations it sets out, to lay down an obligation to disclose (\nPromusicae\n, paragraphs 51 and 53).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must, therefore, be considered that Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46 offers Member States the option to provide for one or more of the exceptions that it sets out, but they are not compelled to do so.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must therefore be examined, in the second place, whether the activity of a private detective acting for a regulated body, such as IPI, falls within the scope of the exceptions provided for in Article 13(1)(d) and (g) of Directive 95/46.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to settled case-law, the protection of the fundamental right to privacy requires that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (Case C-73/07 \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n [2008] ECR I-9831, paragraph 56, and Joined Cases C-92/09 and C-93/09 \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n [2010] ECR I-11063, paragraphs 77 and 86).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the exceptions set out in Article 13(1)(d) and (g) of Directive 95/46, the former refers in particular to a specifically defined situation, namely the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of breaches of ethics for regulated professions, and the latter to the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, which by contrast are not defined.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is necessary first to examine the exception provided for in Article 13(1)(d) of the directive and ascertain whether it applies to the activity of a private detective acting for a body such as IPI.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the order for reference, the profession of estate agent is a regulated profession in Belgium and IPI is a professional body responsible for ensuring compliance with the rules at issue through investigating and reporting breaches of those rules.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The activity of a body such as IPI corresponds to the situation referred to by the exception in Article 13(1)(d) of Directive 95/46, and is therefore capable of coming under that exception.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Directive 95/46 does not specify the manner in which the investigation and detection of failures to comply with the rules are carried out, it must be considered that the directive does not prevent such a professional body from having recourse to specialised investigators, such as private detectives responsible for that investigation and detection, in order to perform its duties.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, if a Member State has chosen to implement the exception provided for in Article 13(1)(d), then the professional body concerned and the private detectives acting for it may rely on it and are not subject to the obligation to inform the data subject provided for in Articles 10 and 11 of Directive 95/46.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, on the other hand, the Member State has not provided for that exception, the data subjects must be informed of the processing of their personal data according to the detailed provisions, in particular those concerning timing, of Articles 10 and 11.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to IPI, application of the exception to the obligation to inform, to IPI itself and to private detectives acting on its behalf, is necessary for it to carry out its role. The IPI claims it would be impossible for private detectives to carry out their activity for IPI effectively if they had to disclose their identity and the reasons for their investigations before even questioning the persons they are investigating. The Netherlands Government also claimed that the investigations at issue would be bound to fail.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from paragraph 37 above, however, it is for the Member States to decide whether they consider it necessary to provide, in their legislation for the exception laid down in Article 13(1)(d) of Directive 95/46 in favour of professional bodies such as IPI, acting directly or with the help of private detectives. It is open to them to take the view that those professional bodies and the private detectives acting for them have sufficient means, notwithstanding the application of Articles 10 and 11 of that directive, of detecting the breaches of ethics at issue, so that it is not necessary for that exception to be implemented in order for those bodies to be able to carry out their duty of ensuring compliance with the rules.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the extent of that exception, the concept of \u2018breaches of ethics\u2019 must next be defined. Differences in opinion have emerged in the written and oral observations submitted to the Court on this point. According to the Belgian Government, and contrary to what IPI claims, the breaches in question only concern the conduct of estate agents duly licenced to practise their profession and do not extend to the conduct of persons who, without being licensed, pass themselves off as estate agents.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be stated that the rules on access to a regulated profession form part of the rules of professional ethics. It follows that investigations concerning the acts of persons who breach those rules by passing themselves off as estate agents are covered by the exception in Article 13(1)(d) of Directive\u00a095/46.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, under that directive, Member States may provide that a regulated professional body, such as IPI, may, alone or with the help of private detectives, investigate possible breaches of the rules of ethics, including breaches resulting from the acts of persons who have failed to observe the rules relating to access to the profession, while being covered by that exception.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the scope of that exception, it is not necessary to examine whether the activity of a private detective acting for a professional body such as IPI is also covered by the exception provided for in Article 13(1)(g) of Directive\u00a095/46.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the first two questions is therefore that:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that Member States have no obligation, but have the option, to transpose into their national law one or more of the exceptions which it lays down to the obligation to inform data subjects of the processing of their personal data;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the activity of a private detective acting for a professional body in order to investigate breaches of ethics of a regulated profession, in this case that of estate agent, is covered by the exception in Article 13(1)(d) of Directive\u00a095/46.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 3\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the answer to the first two questions, there is no need to answer the third question.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. \nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle 13(1) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as meaning that Member States have no obligation, but have the option, to transpose into their national law one or more of the exceptions which it lays down to the obligation to inform data subjects of the processing of their personal data.\nThe activity of a private detective acting for a professional body in order to investigate breaches of ethics of a regulated profession, in this case that of estate agent, is covered by the exception in Article 13(1)(d) of Directive 95/46."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}
