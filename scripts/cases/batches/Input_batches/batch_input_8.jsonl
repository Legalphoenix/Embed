2016/680 state:\n\u2018(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 [the GDPR] lays down general rules to protect natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data and to ensure the free movement of personal data within the Union.\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Declaration No\u00a021 on the protection of personal data in the fields of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation, annexed to the final act of the intergovernmental conference which adopted the Treaty of Lisbon, the conference acknowledged that specific rules on the protection of personal data and the free movement of personal data in the fields of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation based on Article\u00a016 TFEU may prove necessary because of the specific nature of those fields.\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is therefore appropriate for those fields to be addressed by a directive that lays down the specific rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, respecting the specific nature of those activities.\u00a0\u2026\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The activities carried out by the police or other law-enforcement authorities are focused mainly on the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, including police activities without prior knowledge if an incident is a criminal offence or not.\u00a0\u2026 Member States may entrust competent authorities with other tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, so that the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of [the GDPR].\n\u2026\n(14)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since this Directive should not apply to the processing of personal data in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law, activities concerning national security, activities of agencies or units dealing with national security issues and the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Chapter 2 of Title V of the [EU Treaty] should not be considered to be activities falling within the scope of this Directive.\n\u2026\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 The personal data should be adequate and relevant for the purposes for which they are processed. It should, in particular, be ensured that the personal data collected are not excessive and not kept longer than is necessary for the purpose for which they are processed. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means.\u00a0\u2026\n(27)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, it is necessary for competent authorities to process personal data collected in the context of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of specific criminal offences beyond that context in order to develop an understanding of criminal activities and to make links between different criminal offences detected.\n\u2026\n(31)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is inherent to the processing of personal data in the areas of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation that personal data relating to different categories of data subjects are processed. Therefore, a clear distinction should, where applicable and as far as possible, be made between personal data of different categories of data subjects such as: suspects; persons convicted of a criminal offence; victims and other parties, such as witnesses; persons possessing relevant information or contacts; and associates of suspects and convicted criminals.

She was accused, on the basis of Article\u00a0321(3)(2) of the NK, read in conjunction with Article\u00a0321(2) thereof, of participation with three other persons in a criminal organisation, formed with the aim of enrichment, with a view to committing offences under Article\u00a0255 of the NK in concert on Bulgarian territory.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following service of that order accusing her, V.S. was requested to cooperate in the creation of a police record. She completed a declaration form in which she stated that she had been informed of the existence of a statutory basis for the creation of the police record and that she refused to consent to the collection of the dactyloscopic and photographic data concerning her in order for them to be entered in the record and to the taking of a sample for the purpose of creating her DNA profile. The police did not collect the data and brought the matter before the referring court.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The application by the police authorities to the referring court states that sufficient evidence of the guilt of the persons prosecuted in the criminal proceedings concerned, including of V.S., has been gathered. It is explained in the application that V.S. has been formally accused of an offence referred to in Article\u00a0321(3)(2) of the NK, read in conjunction with Article\u00a0321(2) thereof, and that she refused to consent to the collection of dactyloscopic and photographic data concerning her in order for them to be entered in the record and to the taking of a sample for the purpose of creating her DNA profile; the legal basis for the collection of those data is cited. Finally, the referring court is requested in the application to authorise enforcement of collection of the data. Only copies of the order accusing V.S. and of the declaration in which she refuses to give her consent to the creation of the police record were annexed to the application.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court has doubts as to whether the legislative and regulatory provisions of Bulgarian law that are applicable to the creation of a police record are compatible with EU law.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, the referring court points out that Article\u00a025(3) and Article\u00a025a of the ZMVR refer to the GDPR and not to Directive 2016/680. It points out that, whilst the GDPR, by virtue of Article\u00a02(2)(d) thereof, does not apply to the processing of personal data by competent bodies for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680 governs such processing. In addition, it observes that Article\u00a09 of the GDPR expressly prohibits the processing of genetic and biometric data and that combating crime is not among the exceptions to that prohibition that are laid down in Article\u00a09(2). Finally it adds that Article\u00a051 of the ZZLD cannot by itself form the basis for the permissibility of processing of biometric and genetic data, as its permissibility must be provided for by EU or national law.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of those factors, the referring court wonders whether the view may be taken that, despite the reference to Article\u00a09 of the GDPR, the processing of genetic and biometric data for purposes in the criminal field is permissible under national law, having regard to the fact that it is clearly authorised by Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, even though that directive is not referred to by the applicable provisions of the ZMVR.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, if it should be held that Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 has been correctly transposed into national law or that there is a valid legal basis in national law for processing biometric and genetic data, the referring court is uncertain whether the requirement referred to in Article\u00a010(a) of that directive, that such processing must be authorised by EU or Member State law, is satisfied where there is a contradiction between the applicable provisions of national law.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court takes the view that there is a contradiction between Article\u00a025a of the ZMVR, which, by referring to Article\u00a09 of the GDPR, appears not to authorise the collection of biometric and genetic data, and Article\u00a068 of the ZMVR, which undoubtedly authorises it.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, the referring court points out that, under Article\u00a0219(1) of the NPK, it is necessary to gather sufficient evidence that a particular person may be guilty in order for that person to be accused. It is unsure whether the criterion laid down in that provision corresponds to the criterion referred to in Article\u00a06(a) of Directive 2016/680, which concerns persons with regard to whom there are \u2018serious grounds for believing that they have committed [an] offence\u2019. It is rather of the view that, in order to process biometric and genetic data, it is necessary to gather evidence that is more convincing than that which is required under the NPK in order to accuse a person, since the purpose of accusation is to inform that person of the grounds for suspecting him or her and of the possibility of defending himself or herself.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the referring court states that Article\u00a068 of the ZMVR does not provide that, in the context of the procedure for the mandatory creation of a police record, it must carry out any review as to the existence of serious grounds within the meaning of Article\u00a06(a) of Directive 2016/680. On the contrary, under Article\u00a068 of the ZMVR, it is sufficient for it to find that the person has been accused of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution. It thus has no jurisdiction to assess whether sufficient or solid evidence exists in support of such accusation, nor is it able, in practice, to carry out such an assessment since it has access not to the file but only to copies of the order accusing the person and of the declaration refusing consent to the collection of data by the police. Therefore, it is unsure whether, in those circumstances, the person who has refused to make available to the police the photographic, dactyloscopic and genetic data concerning him or her will enjoy effective judicial protection and observance of the right to be presumed innocent, guaranteed in Articles\u00a047 and 48 of the Charter respectively.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fourth place, the referring court infers from Article\u00a04(1)(b) and (c), Article\u00a08(1) and (2) and Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 that national law must confer on the competent authorities a certain degree of discretion when they collect biometric and genetic data by taking photographs, fingerprints and DNA samples. According to the referring court, that discretion should relate both to whether such collection must take place and to whether it must cover all the aforementioned categories of data. Finally, it takes the view that it must be inferred from the requirement, laid down in Article\u00a010 of that directive, that the processing be \u2018strictly necessary\u2019 that the collection of such data can be authorised only where adequate reasons for its necessity are given.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court observes that the creation of a police record applies, however, mandatorily to all persons accused of intentional offences subject to public prosecution and to the three categories of personal data covered by that article, namely photographs, fingerprints and DNA samples.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It observes, furthermore, that only the objectives of such processing of personal data are referred to by the ZMVR, namely the carrying out of investigative activity, including for the purpose of safeguarding national security, combating crime and maintaining law and order. On the other hand, national legislation does not require the specific necessity for the collection of biometric and genetic data to be established and it to be determined whether all of those data, or only a part thereof, suffice.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court is therefore uncertain whether the condition laid down by national law for authorising the creation of a police record, under which the person concerned must have been accused of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution, is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a04(1)(a) and (c), Article\u00a08(1) and (2) and Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was in those circumstances that the Spetsializiran nakazatelen sad (Specialised Criminal Court, Bulgaria) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 effectively transposed into national law\u00a0\u2013 Article\u00a025(3) and Article\u00a025a of the [ZMVR]\u00a0\u2013 by the inclusion of a reference to the similar provision in Article\u00a09 of [the GDPR]?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the requirement set in Article\u00a010(a) of Directive 2016/680 in conjunction with Article\u00a052 and with Articles\u00a03 and 8 of the Charter, that any limitation on integrity and protection of personal data must be provided for by law, fulfilled if contradictory national provisions exist in relation to the permissibility of processing of genetic and biometric data for the purposes of creating a police record?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is a national law, namely Article\u00a068(4) of the [ZMVR], which provides for the obligation of the court of first instance to order the forced collection of personal data (taking photographs for the file, taking fingerprints, and taking samples in order to create a DNA profile), compatible with Article\u00a06(a) of Directive 2016/680 in conjunction with Article\u00a048 of the Charter, if a person who is accused of an intentional criminal offence requiring public prosecution refuses to voluntarily cooperate in the collection of these personal data, without the court being able to assess whether there are serious grounds for believing that the person has committed the criminal offence of which he or she is accused?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is a national law, namely Article\u00a068(1) to (3) of [the ZMVR], which provides, as a general rule, for the taking of photographs for the file, the taking of fingerprints, and the taking of samples in order to create a DNA profile for all persons who are accused of an intentional criminal offence requiring public prosecution compatible with Article\u00a010, Article\u00a04(1)(a) and (c), and Article\u00a08(1) and (2) of Directive 2016/680?\u2019\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 5\u00a0August 2022, the Sofiyski gradski sad (Sofia City Court, Bulgaria) informed the Court that, following a legislative amendment that entered into force on 27\u00a0July 2022, the Spetsializiran nakazatelen sad (Specialised Criminal Court) was dissolved and that certain criminal cases brought before it, including the case in the main proceedings, were transferred from that date to the Sofiyski gradski sad (Sofia City Court).\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first and second\n questions\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first and second questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether Article\u00a010(a) of Directive 2016/680, read in the light of Articles\u00a03, 8 and 52 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that the collection of biometric and genetic data by the police authorities with a view to their investigative activities for purposes of combating crime and maintaining law and order is authorised by Member State law, within the meaning of Article\u00a010(a) of Directive 2016/680, where, first, the national provisions forming the legal basis for that authorisation refer to Article\u00a09 of the GDPR, while reproducing the content of Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, and, second, those national provisions appear to lay down contradictory requirements so far as concerns the permissibility of such collection.\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its written observations, the Commission calls into question the admissibility of the first and second questions, submitting that the referring court, first, seeks solely to ascertain whether national law has in fact transposed Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, without expressing any doubts or raising any issues as to the precise meaning of that article, and second, does not state the reasons that prompted it to inquire about the interpretation or validity of the provisions of EU law at issue, in breach of Article\u00a094 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that, according to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, where the questions referred concern the interpretation or the validity of a rule of EU law, the Court is in principle bound to give a ruling. It follows that questions referred by national courts enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court only where it is apparent that the interpretation sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its object, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 20\u00a0October 2022, Digi, C-77/21, EU:C:2022:805, paragraph\u00a017 and the case-law cited).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, in order to enable the Court to give an interpretation of EU law that is useful to the national court, the request for a preliminary ruling must, under Article\u00a094(c) of the Rules of Procedure, contain a statement of the reasons which prompted the referring court to inquire about the interpretation or validity of certain provisions of EU law, and the relationship between those provisions and the national legislation applicable to the main proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0July 2015, \nGullotta and Farmacia di Gullotta Davide & C.\n, C-497/12, EU:C:2015:436, paragraph\u00a017 and the case-law cited).\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the first and second questions, it is apparent from the order for reference that, in the case in the main proceedings, the referring court is uncertain whether the condition laid down in Article\u00a010(a) of Directive 2016/680, under which processing of genetic and biometric data as covered by that article must be authorised by EU or Member State law, is satisfied so far as concerns the creation of a police record, which is at issue in that case.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the referring court states, in essence, in the request for a preliminary ruling, it is in that context that it seeks guidance from the Court regarding the interpretation of that condition. By its first question, it seeks to ascertain whether Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 may be regarded as having been correctly transposed by a provision of national law which refers only to Article\u00a09 of the GDPR, but the content of which correspond to that of Article\u00a010 of the directive. If the answer is in the affirmative, it also seeks to ascertain, by its second question, whether the collection of genetic and biometric data for the purpose of being entered in a record by the police may be regarded as being \u2018authorised by Member State law\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a010(a) of the directive, that is to say, \u2018provided for by law\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, where the provisions of national law which constitute the legal basis for that processing seem to lay down contradictory rules as to the permissibility of such processing.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the referring court identified clearly, in the request for a preliminary ruling, the applicable provisions of EU law, its queries concerning the interpretation of that law and the reasons which led it to submit the first and second questions to the Court. Furthermore, it is clear from that request that the interpretation of those provisions is connected to the object of the main proceedings, given that any finding by the referring court, in the light of the guidance provided by the Court of Justice, that the provisions of national law at issue do not satisfy the condition laid down in Article\u00a010(a) of Directive 2016/680 is liable to result in the dismissal of the police authorities\u2019 application before it seeking the compulsory collection of V.S.\u2019s biometric and genetic data for the purpose of being entered in a record.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the first and second questions are admissible.\n\u00a0\nSubstance\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be observed that, whilst the second question refers to Articles\u00a03, 8 and 52 of the Charter, it is clear from the request for a preliminary ruling that the referring court\u2019s queries relate only to whether the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings complies with the requirement, in Article\u00a052(1), that any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by the Charter must be provided for by law. Consequently, the first and second questions must be examined in the light of only Article\u00a052 of the Charter.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, it should be noted that, in the light of recital\u00a019 of the GDPR and recitals\u00a09 to 12 of Directive 2016/680 and by virtue of Article\u00a02(1) and Article\u00a09(1) and (2) of that directive, processing of personal data by a \u2018competent authority\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(7) of that directive, may fall\u00a0\u2013 depending on whether it is for the purposes, referred to in Article\u00a01(1) thereof, of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, or for purposes other than those\u00a0\u2013 either within the scope of the specific rules of that directive or within the scope of the general rules of that regulation, apart from where the exceptions to their respective scope, exhaustively listed in Article\u00a02(3) of that directive and Article\u00a02(2) of that regulation, apply.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, it should be noted that Article\u00a09 of the GDPR and Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 both contain provisions governing the processing of special categories of personal data, which are regarded as sensitive data, including genetic and biometric data.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 provides that the processing of those sensitive data is to be allowed \u2018only where strictly necessary, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject\u2019 and only in three cases, including, by virtue of Article\u00a010(a), where that processing is authorised by EU or Member State law. On the other hand, Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR lays down a general prohibition of the processing of those sensitive data, coupled with a list of situations, set out in Article\u00a09(2), in which an exception to that prohibition may be made, a list which does not refer to any situation corresponding to that of data processing for purposes such as those specified in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680 and which would satisfy the requirement set out in Article\u00a010(a) thereof. It follows that, whilst processing of biometric and genetic data by the competent authorities for purposes covered by Directive 2016/680 may be allowed provided that, in accordance with the requirements laid down in Article\u00a010 thereof, it is strictly necessary, is subject to appropriate safeguards and is provided for by EU or Member State law, that will not necessarily be true of processing of such data that falls within the scope of the GDPR.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the scope of the requirement laid down in Article\u00a010(a) of Directive 2016/680 that the processing of the personal data must have been \u2018authorised by Union or Member State law\u2019 must be determined in the light of the requirement enshrined in Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter that any limitation on the exercise of a fundamental right must be \u2018provided for by law\u2019.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is clear from the Court\u2019s case-law that that requirement means that the legal basis authorising such a limitation must define the scope of that limitation sufficiently clearly and precisely (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \n\u00c9tat luxembourgeois (Right to bring an action against a request for information in tax matters)\n, C-245/19 and C-246/19, EU:C:2020:795, paragraph\u00a076 \n\u00a0\nand the case-law cited\n)\n.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it follows from the case-law recalled in the previous paragraph of the present judgment that there can be no uncertainty as to the provisions of EU law pursuant to which national law may authorise processing of biometric and genetic data, such as the processing at issue in the main proceedings, or as to the applicable conditions governing that authorisation. Data subjects and the courts having jurisdiction must be in a position to be able to determine precisely, in particular, the conditions under which that processing may take place and the purposes which it may lawfully pursue. However, the rules of the GDPR and those of the directive that are applicable to those requirements may differ.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, whilst the national legislature has the option to provide, in the same legislative instrument, for the processing of personal data for purposes covered by Directive 2016/680 and for other purposes covered by the GDPR, it has, on the other hand, the obligation, in accordance with the requirements set out in the previous paragraph of the present judgment, to make sure that there is no ambiguity as to the applicability of one or other of those two EU acts to the collection of biometric and genetic data.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, as to the referring court\u2019s queries regarding the possible incorrect transposition of Directive 2016/680, the provisions of national law transposing that directive, in particular Article\u00a010, must be distinguished from those pursuant to which processing of data belonging to the special categories referred to in that article, inter alia biometric and genetic data, may be authorised, within the meaning of Article\u00a010(a).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whilst, as is apparent from the second subparagraph of Article\u00a063(1) thereof, Directive 2016/680 expressly requires the Member States to ensure that the necessary measures transposing the directive contain a reference to it or are accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication, which means, in any event, that a specific act transposing the directive must be adopted (see, to that effect, judgment of 25\u00a0February 2021, \nCommission \nv\n Spain (Personal Data Directive\u00a0\u2013 Criminal law)\n, C-658/19, EU:C:2021:138, paragraph\u00a016 and the case-law cited), it does not require the measures of national law that authorise processing of data falling within its scope to contain such a reference. Thus, Article\u00a063(4) of Directive 2016/680 merely provides that the Member States are to communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by the directive.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, it should be pointed out that, where a directive has been properly transposed, its effects reach individuals through the implementing measures adopted by the Member States concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 15\u00a0May 1986, \nJohnston\n, 222/84, EU:C:1986:206, paragraph\u00a051), unlike a regulation, the provisions of which generally have immediate effect in the national legal systems without it being necessary for the national authorities to adopt measures of application (see, to that effect, judgment of 7\u00a0April 2022, \nIFAP\n, C-447/20 and C-448/20, EU:C:2022:265, paragraph\u00a088 and the case-law cited). It follows that, where the national legislature provides for the processing of biometric and genetic data by competent authorities, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(7) of Directive 2016/680, which are capable of falling either within the scope of that directive or within the scope of the GDPR, it is open to it, for reasons of clarity and precision, to refer explicitly, on the one hand, to the provisions of national law transposing Article\u00a010 of that directive and, on the other, to Article\u00a09 of that regulation. However, that requirement of clarity and precision cannot demand, furthermore, that that directive be mentioned.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, it should be noted that the obligation on a Member State, imposed by the third paragraph of Article\u00a0288 TFEU, to take all the measures necessary to achieve the result prescribed by a directive is binding on all the authorities of Member States including, for matters within their jurisdiction, the courts. It follows that, when national courts apply domestic law, they are bound to interpret it, so far as possible, in the light of the wording and the purpose of the relevant directive in order to achieve the result sought by the directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 7\u00a0November 2019, \nProfi Credit Polska\n, C-419/18 and C-483/18, EU:C:2019:930, paragraphs\u00a073 and 75 and the case-law cited).\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, when faced with an apparent conflict, such as that described by it in the context of the second question, between, on the one hand, provisions of national legislation which seem to preclude the processing of genetic and biometric data by the competent authorities for purposes covered by Directive 2016/680 and, on the other hand, other provisions of that legislation which authorise such processing, the referring court is required to give those provisions an interpretation which safeguards that directive\u2019s effectiveness. In particular, where it finds that provisions such as to satisfy the requirement referred to in Article\u00a010(a) of the directive exist, it is for it to determine whether they do not in actual fact have a field of application different from that of the provisions with which they seem to conflict.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should, in particular, be noted that Article\u00a09(2) of Directive 2016/680 does not preclude the processing of biometric and genetic data by competent authorities, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(7) of that directive, in connection with tasks other than those performed for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of the directive. Also, as is apparent from paragraph\u00a063 of the present judgment, Article\u00a09 of the GDPR, which applies to the processing of such data, as long as the processing is not covered by the exceptions exhaustively listed in Article\u00a02(2) thereof, does not prohibit such processing absolutely, provided that it corresponds to one of the situations set out in Article\u00a09(2) of that regulation. That being so, it is for the referring court to determine whether the reference to the GDPR in those national provisions does not in actual fact relate to data processing by the competent authorities for purposes other than those covered by Directive 2016/680, with the result that those provisions do not conflict with the provisions which, in accordance with Article\u00a010(a) of that directive, provide for the processing of such data for purposes which are covered by that directive.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, it is apparent from the order for reference that the provisions of national law giving rise to the questions submitted by the referring court are provisions of substantive law governing the activities of the Ministry of the Interior. The first of those provisions lays down that the processing of personal data by that ministry is to be carried out under the law in question, in accordance with the GDPR and the act of national law which transposes Directive 2016/680, and the second of those provisions states that the processing of personal data involving genetic data and biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person is to be allowed only as provided for in Article\u00a09 of that regulation or in the provision of national law which transposes Article\u00a010 of that directive. It is also apparent from the order for reference that the provision of substantive law which furnishes an express legal basis for the collection of biometric and genetic data, in the context of creation of a police record, pursues solely purposes of safeguarding national security, combating crime and maintaining law and order.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, it is for the referring court to review whether the dual reference to Article\u00a09 of the GDPR and to the provision of national law which transposes Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 may be justified by the fact that the scope of the provision of substantive law containing such a dual reference covers all the activities of the departments of the Ministry of the Interior, which, according to the information provided by the Bulgarian Government, include both the activities set out in Article\u00a01(1) of that directive and other activities liable to fall within that regulation. Furthermore, it is for the referring court to satisfy itself that, in particular so far as concerns the provision of substantive law which furnishes a legal basis for the collection of biometric and genetic data in the context of creation of a police record, the set of relevant provisions of national law may be interpreted, in accordance with EU law, as making apparent, in a sufficiently clear, precise and unequivocal manner, in which cases the rules of national law transposing the directive at issue apply and in which cases it is the rules of the GDPR that are relevant.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the first and second questions is that Article\u00a010(a) of Directive 2016/680, read in the light of Article\u00a052 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of biometric and genetic data by the police authorities with a view to their investigative activities, for purposes of combating crime and maintaining law and order, is authorised by Member State law, within the meaning of Article\u00a010(a) of Directive 2016/680, provided that the law of that Member State contains a sufficiently clear and precise legal basis to authorise that processing. The fact that the national legislative act containing such a legal basis refers, furthermore, to the GDPR, and not to Directive 2016/680, is not capable, in itself, of calling the existence of such authorisation into question, provided that it is apparent, in a sufficiently clear, precise and unequivocal manner, from the interpretation of the set of applicable provisions of national law that the processing of biometric and genetic data at issue falls within the scope of that directive, and not of that regulation.\n\u00a0\nThe third\n question\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a06(a) of Directive 2016/680 and Articles\u00a047 and 48 of the Charter must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides that, if the person accused of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution refuses to cooperate voluntarily in the collection of the biometric and genetic data concerning him or her in order for them to be entered in a record, the criminal court having jurisdiction must authorise enforcement of their collection, without having the power to assess whether there are serious grounds for believing that the person concerned has committed the offence of which he or she is accused.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted at the outset that this question is asked by the referring court in relation to criminal proceedings in which a provision of national law is applicable that lays down that, if the person concerned refuses to cooperate in the collection of the biometric and genetic data concerning him or her in order for them to be entered in a record for purposes covered by Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, the court having jurisdiction to rule on that person\u2019s criminal liability is empowered to authorise their collection. Furthermore, that provision of national law applies to the data concerning persons accused of intentional offences subject to public prosecution. According to the information provided by the referring court, the vast majority of the offences provided for by the NK are intentional and almost all involve public prosecution. Under the rules of Bulgarian criminal procedure, a person is accused when sufficient evidence that he or she is guilty of an offence subject to public prosecution is gathered.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, according to the explanation provided by the Bulgarian Government in the written answers to the questions asked by the Court, the rules relating to Bulgarian criminal procedure provide that accusation may occur at any time in the preliminary procedure\u00a0\u2013 which constitutes the first stage of the criminal procedure, during which investigation is carried out and evidence is gathered\u00a0\u2013 and, in any event, before the investigation is closed. As is apparent from the order for reference, and as the Bulgarian Government also explains, the person concerned may, after being so accused, present evidence in his or her defence, in particular in the course of the stage of disclosure of the investigative material, which takes place after closure of the investigation.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the referring court states that the national legislation at issue does not confer on the court which authorises collection of the biometric and genetic data concerning the accused person in order for them to be entered in a record jurisdiction to assess the evidence on which that accusation is founded, a power which lies with the authorities handling the investigation. In addition, it explains that that court rules on the application for authorisation solely on the basis of a copy of the order accusing the person concerned and of the declaration by which he or she refuses to consent to the collection of those data.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against that background, the referring court\u2019s third question should, as the Bulgarian Government and the Commission suggest, be regarded as divided into three parts. First, the referring court is uncertain whether Article\u00a06(a) of Directive 2016/680, which refers to the category consisting of persons with regard to whom there are serious grounds for believing that they have committed or are about to commit a criminal offence, precludes national legislation which provides for the compulsory collection, in order to be entered in a record, of biometric and genetic data concerning a natural person in respect of whom sufficient evidence is gathered that he or she is guilty of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution, enabling, under national law, him or her to be accused. Second, it raises the question whether, having regard to the limits on the discretion of the court called upon to rule on the enforcement of such collection, that court is in a position to ensure the person concerned effective judicial protection, in accordance with Article\u00a047 of the Charter. Third, it is uncertain whether, despite those limits, observance of the right to be presumed innocent which is referred to in Article\u00a048 of the Charter can be ensured.\n\u00a0\nThe scope of Article\u00a06(a) of Directive 2016/680\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06 of Directive 2016/680 obliges the Member States to provide for the controller, \u2018where applicable and as far as possible\u2019, to make a clear distinction between personal data of different categories of data subjects, such as those referred to in Article\u00a06(a) to (d), namely, respectively; persons with regard to whom there are serious grounds for believing that they have committed or are about to commit a criminal offence; persons convicted of a criminal offence; victims of a criminal offence or persons with regard to whom certain facts give rise to reasons for believing that he or she could be the victim of a criminal offence; and, finally, other parties to a criminal offence, such as persons who might be called on to testify in investigations in connection with criminal offences or subsequent criminal proceedings, persons who can provide information on criminal offences, or contacts or associates of one of the persons referred to in Article\u00a06(a) and (b).\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the Member States must ensure that a clear distinction is made between the data of the different categories of data subjects in such a way that, as the Advocate General has stated in point\u00a027 of his Opinion, they are not subject without distinction\u00a0\u2013 whatever the category to which they belong\u00a0\u2013 to same degree of interference with their fundamental right to the protection of their personal data. In that regard, as may be inferred from recital\u00a031 of Directive 2016/680, the category of persons defined in Article\u00a06(a) of that directive corresponds to that of persons suspected of having committed a criminal offence.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it follows from the wording of Article\u00a06 of Directive 2016/680 that the obligation which that provision imposes on the Member States is not absolute. First, the phrase \u2018where applicable and as far as possible\u2019, which it contains, indicates that it is for the controller to determine, in each individual case, whether a clear distinction between the personal data of the different categories of data subjects may be made. Second, the words \u2018such as\u2019 which that article contains indicates that the categories of persons listed there are not exhaustive.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the existence of sufficient items of evidence pointing to a person\u2019s guilt constitutes, in principle, a serious ground for believing that he or she has committed the offence at issue. Thus, national legislation which provides for the compulsory collection of biometric and genetic data of natural persons in order for them to be entered in a record, where sufficient evidence is gathered that the person concerned is guilty of a criminal offence, appears consistent with the objective of Article\u00a06(a) of Directive 2016/680.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all the foregoing that Article\u00a06(a) of Directive 2016/680 does not preclude national legislation which provides for the compulsory collection, in order to be entered in a record, of biometric and genetic data concerning persons in respect of whom sufficient evidence is gathered that they are guilty of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution and who have been accused for that reason.\n\u00a0\nObservance of the right to effective judicial protection\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, it should be noted that the right to effective judicial protection, enshrined in Article\u00a047 of the Charter, must be accorded to any person relying on rights or freedoms guaranteed by EU law against a decision adversely affecting him or her which is such as to undermine those rights or freedoms (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \n\u00c9tat luxembourgeois (Right to bring an action against a request for information in tax matters)\n, C-245/19 and \n\u00a0\nC\n-\n246\n/19, EU:C:2020:795, \nparagraphs\u00a055\n, 57 \nand\n 58 \nand the case-law cited\n)\n.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, any accused person who has opposed the collection of photographic, dactyloscopic and genetic data concerning him or her in the context of a procedure such as the creation of a police record, a procedure which has to comply with the requirements of Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, must, as Article\u00a047 of the Charter requires, be able to enjoy the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal against the decision to authorise enforcement of their collection, for the purpose of relying on the rights which he or she derives from the safeguards laid down by that provision and, in particular, from the safeguard under Article\u00a010(a) of the directive that collection of the biometric and genetic data must be carried out in compliance with the national legislation that authorises collection. In particular, that safeguard entails the court with jurisdiction having the ability to verify that the measure accusing the person concerned that constitutes the legal basis for the creation of the police record has been adopted\u00a0\u2013 in accordance with the rules of national criminal procedure\u00a0\u2013 in the light of sufficient evidence that he or she is guilty of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be borne in mind that the right to effective judicial protection is not an absolute right and that, in accordance with Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, limitations may be placed upon it, on condition that (i) those limitations are provided for by law, (ii) they respect the essence of the rights and freedoms at issue, and (iii) in compliance with the principle of proportionality, they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \n\u00c9tat luxembourgeois (Right to bring an action against a request for information in tax matters)\n, C-245/19 and \n\u00a0\nC\n-\n246\n/19, EU:C:2020:795, \nparagraphs\u00a049\n and\n 51 \nand the case-law cited\n)\n.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it should be noted that Article\u00a054 of Directive 2016/680 imposes an obligation on the Member States to provide that a person who considers that his or her rights laid down in provisions adopted pursuant to that directive have been infringed as a result of the processing of his or her personal data in non-compliance with those provisions has the right to an effective judicial remedy. It follows that the EU legislature did not itself limit the exercise of the right to an effective remedy enshrined in Article\u00a047 of the Charter and that it is open to the Member States to limit its exercise, provided that they meet the requirements laid down in Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \n\u00c9tat luxembourgeois (Right to bring an action against a request for information in tax matters)\n, C-245/19 and C-246/19, EU:C:2020:795, paragraphs\u00a063 and 64).\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, it should be determined whether, without prejudice to the judicial remedy provided for by national law pursuant to Article\u00a054 of Directive 2016/680, the fact that the court having jurisdiction, with a view to authorising a measure enforcing the collection of biometric and genetic data concerning accused persons, cannot review, on the merits, the conditions for the accusation on which that enforcement measure is founded constitutes a permitted limitation of the right to effective judicial protection enshrined in Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the first condition referred to in paragraph\u00a089 of the present judgment, in accordance with the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a065 of the present judgment, it is for the referring court to ascertain whether the limits placed on its discretion by national law, in the context of an application requesting it to authorise enforcement of the collection of biometric and genetic data concerning an accused person in order for them to be entered in a record, are laid down by national law sufficiently clearly and precisely.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the second condition, it follows from the case-law that the essence of the right to an effective remedy includes, among other aspects, the possibility, for the person who holds that right, of accessing a court or tribunal with the power to ensure respect for the rights guaranteed to that person by EU law and, to that end, to consider all the issues of fact and of law that are relevant for resolving the case before it (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \n\u00c9tat luxembourgeois (Right to bring an action against a request for information in tax matters)\n, C-245/19 and \n\u00a0\nC\n-\n246\n/19, EU:C:2020:795, \nparagraph\u00a066 \n\u00a0\nand the case-law cited\n)\n.\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it also follows from the case-law of the Court that that condition does not mean, as such, that the holder of the right to effective judicial protection must have a direct remedy the primary object of which is to call into question a given measure, provided that one or more legal remedies also exist, before the various national courts having jurisdiction, enabling that rightholder to obtain, indirectly, judicial review of that measure ensuring respect for the rights and freedoms guaranteed to that rightholder by EU law (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \n\u00c9tat luxembourgeois (Right to bring an action against a request for information in tax matters)\n, C-245/19 and \n\u00a0\nC\n-\n246\n/19, EU:C:2020:795, \nparagraph\u00a079 \n\u00a0\nand the case-law cited\n)\n.\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, as the Advocate General has noted, in essence, in point\u00a036 of his Opinion, the third question is based on the hypothesis that the preliminary stage of the criminal procedure, during which enforcement of collection of the biometric and genetic data concerning an accused person in order for them to be entered in a record takes place, will be followed by a judicial stage. If the existence of sufficient items of incriminating evidence, a necessary condition in order for the person concerned to be capable of being compelled to consent to the collection of his or her biometric and genetic data, cannot be verified at the time of the application for authorisation of enforcement, it will necessarily have to be capable of being verified in that judicial stage, during which the court hearing the case must have the ability to consider all the relevant issues of fact and of law, in particular in order to verify whether those biometric and genetic data have been obtained in breach of the rights guaranteed by EU law to the person concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \n\u00c9tat luxembourgeois (Right to bring an action against a request for information in tax matters)\n, C-245/19 and \n\u00a0\nC\n-\n246\n/19, EU:C:2020:795, \nparagraphs\u00a081 \n\u00a0\nto \n83 \nand the case-law cited\n)\n.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, in accordance with Article\u00a054 of Directive 2016/680, national law must provide the person concerned with the opportunity to effectively challenge the compulsory collection of his or her biometric and genetic data in judicial proceedings, founded on the alleged infringement, on account of collection of the data, of the rights conferred on him or her by that directive, without prejudice to any available administrative or non-judicial remedy, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. Consequently, even if the preliminary stage of the criminal procedure is not followed by a judicial stage, in particular if there is no prosecution, the person concernedmust be able to obtain full judicial review of the legality of the processing of the data in question. Accordingly, where, in order to comply with the obligation in Article\u00a054, national law provides such safeguards, a matter which is for the referring court to ascertain, respect for the essence of the right to effective judicial protection must be presumed, even if the court which authorises enforcement of the collection at issue does not itself have, at the time when it rules on it, the discretion necessary in order to grant such protection.\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the third condition, it should be pointed out, first of all, that the collection of genetic and biometric data concerning persons accused in a criminal procedure, in order for them to be entered in a record, pursues purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, in particular those relating to the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, which constitute objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such collection may contribute to the objective set out in recital\u00a027 of Directive 2016/680, which states that, for the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, it is necessary for competent authorities to process personal data collected in the context of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of specific criminal offences beyond that context in order to develop an understanding of criminal activities and to make links between different criminal offences detected.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present instance, as the Bulgarian Government stated in its written observations and further explained in a written reply to a question asked by the Court, the creation of police records that is established by national law pursues two fundamental purposes. First, the data are gathered and processed in order to be compared with other data collected during investigations relating to other offences. That purpose, according to the Bulgarian Government, also concerns comparison with data collected in other Member States. Second, the data may also be processed for the purposes of the criminal procedure in which the person concerned has been accused.\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It may prove justified, during the preliminary stage of the criminal procedure, to shield temporarily from judicial review the assessment of the evidence on which accusation of the person concerned, and therefore the collection of his or her biometric and genetic data, is founded. Such review, at that stage, might impede the conduct of the criminal investigation in the course of which those data are being collected and excessively limit the investigators\u2019 ability to clear up other offences on the basis of a comparison of those data with data gathered during other investigations. That limitation of effective judicial protection is therefore not disproportionate, provided that national law subsequently guarantees effective judicial review.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all the foregoing that Article\u00a047 of the Charter does not preclude a national court, when it rules on an application for authorisation of enforcement of the collection of biometric and genetic data of an accused person in order for them to be entered in a record, from being unable to assess the evidence on which the accusation of that person is based, provided that national law subsequently guarantees effective judicial review of the conditions for that accusation, from which the authorisation to collect those data arises.\n\u00a0\nObservance of the presumption of innocence\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, it should be noted that, under Article\u00a048(1) of the Charter, the content of which corresponds to that of Article\u00a06(2) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, everyone who has been charged is to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the Court has acknowledged that it follows from the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights inter alia that the presumption of innocence is infringed if a judicial decision concerning an accused person reflects the feeling that he or she is guilty, although his or her guilt has not previously been lawfully established (see, to that effect, judgment of 25\u00a0February 2021, \nDalli\n v \nCommission\n, C-615/19\u00a0P, EU:C:2021:133, paragraph\u00a0224 and the case-law cited).\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, as is apparent from recital\u00a031 of Directive 2016/680, the establishment of different categories of persons, the processing of whose personal data is to differ correspondingly, pursuant to Article\u00a06 of that directive, should not prevent the application of the right of presumption of innocence as guaranteed by the Charter and by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the referring court\u2019s queries as to whether the right to be presumed innocent is observed by a judicial decision authorising the collection of biometric and genetic data concerning accused persons in order for them to be entered in a record, it must be stated, first, that, in so far as national law provides that their collection is limited to the category of persons who are accused, that is to say, a category of persons whose criminal liability has not yet been established, their collection cannot be regarded, in itself, as being such as to reflect the feeling of the authorities that those persons are guilty, within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a0103 of the present judgment.\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, where a judicial decision authorising the collection of biometric and genetic data concerning accused persons in order for them to be entered in a record merely takes note of the accusation of the person concerned and of his or her refusal to consent to such collection, it cannot be interpreted as defining a position on that person\u2019s guilt or, therefore, as undermining the presumption that he or she is innocent.\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that the court which must make such a judicial decision cannot assess, at that stage of the criminal procedure, whether the evidence on which the accusation of the person concerned is based is sufficient constitutes a guarantee for the latter of observance of the right to be presumed innocent.\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such a guarantee is all the more necessary where national law, such as the provision at issue in the main proceedings, provides that the court having jurisdiction to rule on enforcement of collection of the biometric and genetic data concerning accused persons in order for them to be entered in a record is the court which, at the judicial stage of the criminal procedure, will have to rule on the criminal liability of such a person. Observance of the right to be presumed innocent requires that court to be free of any bias and any prejudice when it carries out that examination (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0November 2021, \nProkuratura Rejonowa w Mi\u0144sku Mazowieckim and Others\n, C-748/19 to C-754/19, EU:C:2021:931, paragraph\u00a088).\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that the right to be presumed innocent, enshrined in Article\u00a048 of the Charter, does not preclude accused persons, at the preliminary stage of the criminal procedure, from being the subject of a measure by which the biometric and genetic data concerning them are collected in order to be entered in a record and which is authorised by a court that does not have the power to assess, at that stage, the evidence upon which such accusation is based.\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all the foregoing that the answer to the third question is that Article\u00a06(a) of Directive 2016/680 and Articles\u00a047 and 48 of the Charter must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which provides that, if the person accused of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution refuses to cooperate voluntarily in the collection of the biometric and genetic data concerning him or her in order for them to be entered in a record, the criminal court having jurisdiction must authorise a measure enforcing their collection, without having the power to assess whether there are serious grounds for believing that the person concerned has committed the offence of which he or she is accused, provided that national law subsequently guarantees effective judicial review of the conditions for that accusation, from which the authorisation to collect those data arises.\n\u00a0\nThe fo\nurth\n question\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, in the procedure laid down by Article\u00a0267 TFEU, providing for cooperation between national courts and the Court, it is for the latter to provide the national court with an answer which will be of use to it and enable it to determine the case before it. To that end, the Court may have to reformulate the questions referred to it (judgment of 15\u00a0July 2021, \nThe Department for Communities in Northern Ireland\n, C-709/20, EU:C:2021:602, paragraph\u00a061 and the case-law cited).\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is clear from the order for reference and as has been observed in paragraphs\u00a046 and 49 of the present judgment, in the context of the fourth question the referring court is uncertain as to the implications of the requirements set out in Article\u00a04(1)(a) to (c), Article\u00a08(1) and (2) and Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680.\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as has been observed in paragraphs\u00a046 to 48 of the present judgment, the referring court states that, although those provisions appear to it to require that the competent authorities have a discretion for the purpose of determining whether collection of biometric and genetic data is necessary and that they state adequate reasons for collecting them, the creation of a police record, as provided for by the legislation applicable in the main proceedings, applies mandatorily to all persons accused of intentional offences subject to public prosecution and to the three categories of biometric and genetic data covered by the provision of national law at issue in the main proceedings, without that legislation requiring the specific necessity to collect all those categories of data to be established.\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the fourth question should be understood as seeking to establish, in essence, whether Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, read in conjunction with Article\u00a04(1)(a) to (c) and Article\u00a08(1) and (2) thereof, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides for the systematic collection of biometric and genetic data of any person accused of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution in order for them to be entered in a record, without laying down an obligation on the competent authority to determine and to demonstrate, first, that their collection is necessary for achieving the specific objectives pursued and, second, that those objectives cannot be achieved by collecting only a part of the data concerned.\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, the referring court\u2019s queries concern the requirement set out in Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 that processing of the special categories of data referred to in that article is to be allowed \u2018only where strictly necessary\u2019.\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in the first place, it should be noted that, as has been stated in paragraphs\u00a062 and 63 of the present judgment, Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 constitutes a specific provision governing processing of the special categories of personal data, including biometric and genetic data. As is clear from the case-law, the purpose of that article is to ensure enhanced protection with regard to that processing, which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data at issue and the context in which they are processed, is liable, as is apparent from recital\u00a037 of the directive, to create significant risks to fundamental rights and freedoms, such as the right to respect for private life and the right to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter (see, by analogy, judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a044).\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as follows from the very terms in which it is set out in Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, the requirement that the processing of such data be allowed \u2018only where strictly necessary\u2019 [(\u2018\nuniquement en cas de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 absolue\n\u2019 in the French-language version)] must be interpreted as establishing strengthened conditions for lawful processing of sensitive data, compared with those which follow from Article\u00a04(1)(b) and (c) and Article\u00a08(1) of that directive and refer only to the \u2018necessity\u2019 of data processing that falls generally, within the directive\u2019s scope.\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, first, the use of the adverb \u2018only\u2019 before the words \u2018where strictly necessary\u2019 underlines that the processing of special categories of data, within the meaning of Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, will be capable of being regarded as necessary solely in a limited number of cases. Second, the fact that the necessity for processing of such data is an \u2018absolute\u2019 one [(\u2018\nabsolue\n\u2019)] signifies that that necessity is to be assessed with particular rigour.\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact pleaded by the French Government that, in certain language versions of Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, that article refers to cases where the data processing is \u2018strictly necessary\u2019 is not decisive in that regard. That terminological variation does not alter the nature of the criterion thereby referred to and the requisite standard, since those language versions also establish a strengthened condition in order for the processing of sensitive data to be allowed, entailing a more rigorous assessment of its necessity than where the data processed do not fall within the scope of that article.\n120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as the Commission also notes, the requirement that processing of data falling within Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 is to be allowed only where strictly necessary did not appear in the proposal for a directive (COM(2012) 10 final) giving rise to that directive, but was introduced subsequently by the EU legislature, which thus clearly sought to impose a strengthened condition governing the necessity of data processing, in line with the objective pursued by that article of giving greater protection to persons in respect of the processing of sensitive data.\n121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, as regards what is entailed by the requirement that the processing of sensitive data is to be allowed \u2018only where strictly necessary\u2019, it should be pointed out that the specific requirements of Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 constitute a special form of implementation, applicable to certain categories of data, of the principles set out in Articles\u00a04 and 8 of that directive, which must be observed by any data processing falling within the directive\u2019s scope. Consequently, the scope of those various requirements must be determined in the light of those principles.\n122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, first, the question whether collection of the biometric and genetic data of accused persons in order for them to be entered in a record is \u2018strictly necessary\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, must be determined in the light of the purposes of their collection. In accordance with the purpose limitation principle set out in Article\u00a04(1)(b) of that directive, those purposes must be \u2018specified, explicit and legitimate\u2019. Second, although the requirement that processing of the biometric and genetic data is to be allowed \u2018only where strictly necessary\u2019 corresponds, as has been observed in paragraphs\u00a0117 to 119 of the present judgment, to a requirement for enhanced protection of certain categories of data, it nonetheless constitutes a specific application to the categories of data referred to in Article\u00a010 of the directive of the principle of data minimisation, set out in Article\u00a04(1)(c) of the directive, under which personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.\n123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in the light of Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 2016/680, the scope of that requirement must also be determined having regard to Article\u00a08(1) thereof, according to which Member States must provide, in particular, for processing to be lawful only if and to the extent that processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out by a competent authority for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of the directive, and to Article\u00a08(2), which requires Member State law regulating processing within the scope of the directive to specify at least the objectives of processing, the personal data to be processed and the purposes of the processing.\n124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the purposes of processing biometric and genetic data cannot be indicated in terms that are too general, but have to be defined sufficiently precisely and specifically to enable assessment of whether that processing is \u2018strictly necessary\u2019.\n125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the requirement that processing of sensitive data be \u2018strictly necessary\u2019 entails particularly strict checking, in that context, as to whether the principle of data minimisation is observed.\n126\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, first, it must be borne in mind, as is apparent from recital\u00a026 of Directive 2016/680, that the requirement of necessity is met where the objective pursued by the data processing at issue cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights of data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and\u00a08 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0August 2022, \nVyriausioji tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija\n, C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601, paragraph\u00a085 and the case-law cited). In particular, in the light of the enhanced protection of persons with regard to the processing of sensitive data, the controller in respect of that processing should satisfy itself that that objective cannot be met by having recourse to categories of data other than those listed in Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680.\n127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, having regard to the significant risks posed by the processing of sensitive data to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular in the context of the tasks of the competent authorities for the purposes set out in Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2016/680, the \u2018strictly necessary\u2019 requirement means that account is to be taken of the specific importance of the objective that such processing is intended to achieve. Such importance may be assessed, inter alia, on the basis of the very nature of the objective pursued\u00a0\u2013 in particular of the fact that the processing serves a specific objective connected with the prevention of criminal offences or threats to public security displaying a certain degree of seriousness, the punishment of such offences or protection against such threats\u00a0\u2013 and in the light of the specific circumstances in which that processing is carried out.\n128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the foregoing, it must be held that national legislation which provides for the systematic collection of the biometric and genetic data of any person accused of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution is, in principle, contrary to the requirement laid down in Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 that processing of the special categories of data referred to in that article is to be allowed \u2018only where strictly necessary\u2019.\n129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such legislation is liable to lead, in an indiscriminate and generalised manner, to collection of the biometric and genetic data of most accused persons since the concept of \u2018intentional criminal offence subject to public prosecution\u2019 is particularly general and is liable to apply to a large number of criminal offences, irrespective of their nature and gravity.\n130\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that such legislation restricts the scope of the collection of biometric and genetic data to persons accused at the investigation stage of a criminal procedure, that is to say, to persons with regard to whom there are serious grounds for believing that they have committed a criminal offence, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(a) of Directive 2016/680. However, the mere fact that a person is accused of an intentional criminal offence subject to public prosecution cannot be regarded as a factor that in itself enables it to be presumed that the collection of his or her biometric and genetic data is strictly necessary in the light of the purposes that it pursues and given the resulting interference with fundamental rights, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, first, where there are serious grounds for believing that the person in issue has committed a criminal offence, justifying his or her being accused, a situation which presupposes that sufficient evidence of that person\u2019s involvement in the offence has already been gathered, it is possible that the collection both of the biometric data and of the genetic data will not reflect any specific necessity for the purposes of the criminal procedure in progress.\n132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the likelihood of the biometric and genetic data of an accused person being strictly necessary in connection with procedures other than the procedure in which that accusation has taken place can be determined only in the light of all the relevant factors, such as, in particular, the nature and gravity of the presumed offence of which he or she is accused, the particular circumstances of that offence, any link between that offence and other procedures in progress, and the criminal record or individual profile of the person in issue.\n133\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, it is for the referring court to verify whether, in order to ensure the effectiveness of Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, it is possible to interpret the national legislation providing for the enforcement in question in a manner consistent with EU law. In particular, it is for the referring court to verify whether national law enables it to be assessed whether it is \u2018strictly necessary\u2019 to collect both the biometric data and the genetic data of the data subject in order for them to be entered in a record. For that purpose, it should, inter alia, be possible to verify whether the nature and gravity of the offence of which the data subject in the main proceedings is suspected or whether other relevant factors, such as those referred to in paragraph\u00a0132 of the present judgment, may constitute circumstances capable of establishing that collection is \u2018strictly necessary\u2019. Furthermore, it should be checked whether the collection of civil status data, which is also provided for in the context of the creation of a police record, as the Bulgarian Government confirmed in a written reply to a question asked by the Court, does not in itself enable the objectives pursued to be met.\n134\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If national law does not guarantee such review of the measure whereby biometric and genetic data are collected, it is for the referring court to ensure that Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680 is given full effect by dismissing the police authorities\u2019 application requesting it to authorise enforcement of their collection.\n135\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all the foregoing that Article\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, read in conjunction with Article\u00a04(1)(a) to (c) and Article\u00a08(1) and (2) thereof, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides for the systematic collection of biometric and genetic data of any person accused of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution in order for them to be entered in a record, without laying down an obligation on the competent authority to verify whether and demonstrate that, first, their collection is strictly necessary for achieving the specific objectives pursued and, second, those objectives cannot be achieved by measures constituting a less serious interference with the rights and freedoms of the person concerned.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n136\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a010(a) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA, read in the light of Article\u00a052 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the processing of biometric and genetic data by the police authorities with a view to their investigative activities, for purposes of combating crime and maintaining law and order, is authorised by Member State law, within the meaning of Article\u00a010(a) of Directive 2016/680, provided that the law of that Member State contains a sufficiently clear and precise legal basis to authorise that processing. The fact that the national legislative act containing such a legal basis refers, furthermore, to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), and not to Directive 2016/680, is not capable, in itself, of calling the existence of such authorisation into question, provided that it is apparent, in a sufficiently clear, precise and unequivocal manner, from the interpretation of the set of applicable provisions of national law that the processing of biometric and genetic data at issue falls within the scope of that directive, and not of that regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a06(a) of Directive 2016/680 and Articles\u00a047 and 48 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\nmust be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which provides that, if the person accused of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution refuses to cooperate voluntarily in the collection of the biometric and genetic data concerning him or her in order for them to be entered in a record, the criminal court having jurisdiction must authorise a measure enforcing their collection, without having the power to assess whether there are serious grounds for believing that the person concerned has committed the offence of which he or she is accused, provided that national law subsequently guarantees effective judicial review of the conditions for that accusation, from which the authorisation to collect those data arises.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a010 of Directive 2016/680, read in conjunction with Article\u00a04(1)(a) to (c) and Article\u00a08(1) and (2) thereof,\nmust be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides for the systematic collection of biometric and genetic data of any person accused of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution in order for them to be entered in a record, without laying down an obligation on the competent authority to verify whether and demonstrate that, first, their collection is strictly necessary for achieving the specific objectives pursued and, second, those objectives cannot be achieved by measures constituting a less serious interference with the rights and freedoms of the person concerned."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The latter also provides publicly available telephone services in Germany.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those service providers brought proceedings before the Verwaltungsgericht K\u00f6ln (Administrative Court, Cologne, Germany), challenging the obligation imposed on them by the combined provisions of Paragraph\u00a0113a(1) and Paragraph\u00a0113b of the TKG to retain traffic and location data relating to their customers\u2019 telecommunications as from 1\u00a0July 2017.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By judgments of 20\u00a0April 2018, the Verwaltungsgericht K\u00f6ln (Administrative Court, Cologne) held that SpaceNet and Telekom Deutschland were not required to retain the traffic data relating to the telecommunications, referred to in Paragraph\u00a0113b(3) of the TKG, of the customers to whom they provide internet access and that Telekom Deutschland was also not required to retain the traffic data relating to the telecommunications, referred to in the first and second sentences of Paragraph\u00a0113b(2) of the TKG, of customers to whom it provides publicly available telephone services. That court considered, in the light of the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), that that retention obligation was contrary to EU law.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Republic of Germany brought appeals on a point of law against those judgments before the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court, Germany), the referring court.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court considers that the question whether the retention obligation imposed by the combined provisions of Paragraph\u00a0113a(1) and Paragraph\u00a0113b of the TKG is contrary to EU law depends on the interpretation of Directive 2002/58.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, the referring court states that the Court has already established definitively, in the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), that rules governing the retention of traffic and location data and access to those data by national authorities fall, in principle, within the scope of Directive 2002/58.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It also states that the retention obligation at issue in the main proceedings, since it limits the rights deriving from Article\u00a05(1), Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a09(1) of Directive 2002/58, could be justified only on the basis of Article\u00a015(1) of that directive.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, it notes that it follows from the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which, for the purpose of fighting crime, provides for the general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data of all subscribers and registered users relating to all means of electronic communication.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, like the national legislation at issue in the cases which gave rise to that judgment, the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings does not require any reason for the retention of the data or any link between the data retained and a criminal offence or a risk to public security. That national legislation requires the general retention, without a reason, and without any distinction in terms of personal, temporal or geographical factors, of the majority of the traffic data relating to telecommunications.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court considers, however, that it cannot be ruled out that the retention obligation at issue in the main proceedings may be justified under Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it notes that, contrary to the national legislation at issue in the cases that gave rise to the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings does not require the retention of all telecommunications traffic data of all subscribers and users in relation to all means of electronic communications. Not only is the content of communications excluded from the retention obligation, but data relating to websites visited, the data from electronic mail services and the data underlying social or religious communications to or from certain lines cannot be retained, as is apparent from Paragraph\u00a0113b(5) and (6) of the TKG.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, that court indicates that Paragraph\u00a0113b(1) of the TKG provides for a retention period of 4\u00a0weeks for location data and 10\u00a0weeks for traffic data, whereas Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\u00a0March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58 (OJ 2006 L\u00a0105, p.\u00a054), on which the national legislation at issue in the cases that gave rise to the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), were based, provided for a retention period of between six months and two years.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, although the exclusion of certain means of communication or certain categories of data and the limitation of the retention period are not sufficient to eliminate all risk of establishing a comprehensive profile of the persons concerned, that risk would be at least considerably reduced in the context of the implementation of the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, that legislation contains strict limitations as regards the protection of retained data and access thereto. Thus, first, it ensures the effective protection of retained data against the risks of abuse and against any unlawful access to those data. Secondly, the data retained can be used only for the purposes of fighting serious crime or for the prevention of a specific risk to a person\u2019s physical integrity, life or freedom or to the continued existence of the Federal Republic or a \nLand\n.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fourth place, the interpretation of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 to the effect that any data retention without a reason is generally incompatible with EU law could conflict with the Member States\u2019 obligation to act, arising from the right to security enshrined in Article\u00a06 of the Charter.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fifth place, the referring court considers that an interpretation of Article\u00a015 of Directive 2002/58 as precluding the general retention of data would considerably restrict the discretion of the national legislature in an area concerning the prosecution of crimes and public security, which, in accordance with Article\u00a04(2) TEU, remains the sole responsibility of each Member State.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the sixth place, the referring court considers that it is necessary to take into account the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights and notes that that court has held that Article\u00a08 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u2018the ECHR\u2019) does not preclude national provisions providing for the bulk interception of cross-border flows of data, in view of the threats currently facing many States and the technological tools which terrorists and criminals may now use in order to commit wrongdoings.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018In the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the [Charter], on the one hand, and of Article\u00a06 of the [Charter] and Article\u00a04 [TEU], on the other hand, is Article\u00a015 of Directive [2002/58] to be interpreted as precluding national legislation which obliges providers of publicly available electronic communications services to retain traffic and location data of end users of those services where:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that obligation does not require a specific reason in terms of location, time or region,\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the following data are

and C-794/19 were joined for the purposes of the written and oral parts of the procedure and the judgment.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of the President of the Court of 14\u00a0July 2020, the proceedings in Joined Cases C-793/19 and C-794/19 were stayed pursuant to Article\u00a055(1)(b) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, pending delivery of the judgment in \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 6\u00a0October 2020, the Court delivered its judgment in \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), and, on 8\u00a0October 2020, the President of the Court ordered the resumption of the proceedings in Joined Cases C-793/19 and C-794/19.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court, to which the Registry communicated that judgment, stated that it was maintaining its request for a preliminary ruling.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, the referring court first of all noted that the retention obligation provided for by the legislation at issue in the main proceedings concerns a smaller amount of data and a shorter retention period than that provided for by the national legislation at issue in the cases that gave rise to the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791\n)\n. Those particular features reduce the possibility that the data retained could allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data have been retained.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, it reiterated that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings ensures the effective protection of retained data against the risks of abuse and unlawful access.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, it indicated that uncertainties remain as regards the question of the compatibility with EU law of the retention of IP addresses, provided for by the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, due to an inconsistency between paragraphs\u00a0155 and 168 of the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791\n)\n. Thus, according to the referring court, uncertainty arises from that judgment as to whether the Court requires, for the retention of IP addresses, a ground for retention linked to the objective of safeguarding national security, combating serious crime or preventing serious threats to public security, as seems to follow from paragraph\u00a0168 of that judgment, or whether the retention of IP addresses is permitted even in the absence of a specific ground, since only the use of the retained data is limited by those objectives, as paragraph\u00a0155 of that judgment suggests.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the question referred\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its question, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a06 to 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(l) of the Charter and Article\u00a04(2) TEU, must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes a national legislative measure which, with certain exceptions, requires providers of publicly available electronic communications services\u00a0\u2013 for the purposes set out in Article\u00a015(1) of that directive, and inter alia for the purposes of prosecuting serious criminal offences or preventing a specific risk to national security\u00a0\u2013 to retain, in a general and indiscriminate way, most of the traffic and location data of the end users of those services, laying down a retention period of several weeks and rules intended to ensure the effective protection of the retained data against the risks of abuse and against any unlawful access to those data.\n\u00a0\nApplicability of Directive 2002/58\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the argument of Ireland and the French, Netherlands, Polish and Swedish Governments that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings does not fall within the scope of Directive 2002/58, since it was adopted, inter alia, in order to safeguard national security, it is sufficient to note that national legislation which requires providers of electronic communications services to retain traffic and location data for the purposes, inter alia, of protecting national security and combating crime, such as the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, falls within the scope of Directive 2002/58 (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0104).\n\u00a0\nInterpretation of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58\n\u00a0\nThe principles drawn from the Court\u2019s case-law\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is settled case-law that, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary not only to refer to its wording but also to consider its context and the objectives of the legislation of which it forms part, and in particular the origin of that legislation (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a032 and the case-law cited).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from the wording itself of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 that the legislative measures that it authorises Member States to take, under the conditions that it lays down, may seek only \u2018to restrict the scope\u2019 of the rights and obligations laid down inter alia in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58 (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a033).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the system established by that directive of which Article\u00a015(1) forms part, it must be recalled that, pursuant to the first and second sentences of Article\u00a05(1) of that directive, Member States are required to ensure, through their national legislation, the confidentiality of communications by means of a public communications network and publicly available electronic communications services, as well as of the related traffic data. In particular, they are required to prohibit listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communications and the related traffic data by persons other than users, without the consent of the users concerned, except when legally authorised to do so in accordance with Article\u00a015(1) of the same directive (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a034).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court has already held that Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2002/58 enshrines the principle of confidentiality of both electronic communications and the related traffic data and requires inter alia that, in principle, persons other than users be prohibited from storing, without those users\u2019 consent, those communications and data (judgments of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others,\n C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791\n, paragraph\u00a0107, \nand of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a035).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That provision reflects the objective pursued by the EU legislature when adopting Directive 2002/58. It is apparent from the Explanatory Memorandum of the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (COM(2000)\u00a0385 final), which gave rise to Directive 2002/58, that the EU legislature sought to \u2018ensure that a high level of protection of personal data and privacy will continue to be guaranteed for all electronic communications services regardless of the technology used\u2019. As is apparent from, inter alia, recitals\u00a06 and 7 thereof, the purpose of that directive is to protect users of electronic communications services from risks for their personal data and privacy resulting from new technologies and, in particular, from the increasing capacity for automated storage and processing of data. In particular, as stated in recital\u00a02 of the directive, the EU legislature\u2019s intent is to ensure full respect for the rights set out in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, relating, respectively, to respect for private and family life and the protection of personal data (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a036 and the case-law cited).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In adopting Directive 2002/58, the EU legislature gave concrete expression to those rights, so that the users of electronic communications services are entitled to expect, in principle, that their communications and data relating thereto will remain anonymous and may not be recorded, unless they have agreed otherwise (judgments of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0109, and of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a037).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the processing and storage by electronic communications service providers of subscribers\u2019 and users\u2019 traffic data, Article\u00a06 of Directive 2002/58 provides, in paragraph\u00a01, that those data must be erased or made anonymous, when they are no longer needed for the purpose of the transmission of a communication, and states, in paragraph\u00a02, that the traffic data necessary for the purposes of subscriber billing and interconnection fees may only be processed up to the end of the period during which the bill may lawfully be challenged or payment pursued. As regards location data other than traffic data, Article\u00a09(1) of that directive provides that those data may be processed only subject to certain conditions and after they have been made anonymous or the consent of the users or subscribers obtained.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, Directive 2002/58 does not merely create a framework for access to such data through safeguards to prevent abuse, but also enshrines, in particular, the principle of the prohibition of their storage by third parties (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a039).\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 permits Member States to adopt legislative measures that \u2018restrict the scope\u2019 of the rights and obligations laid down inter alia in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of that directive, such as those arising from the principles of confidentiality of communications and the prohibition on storing related data recalled in paragraph\u00a052 above, that provision provides for an exception to the general rule provided for inter alia in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 and must thus, in accordance with settled case-law, be the subject of a strict interpretation. That provision, therefore, cannot permit the exception to the obligation of principle to ensure the confidentiality of electronic communications and data relating thereto and, in particular, to the prohibition on storage of those data, laid down in Article\u00a05 of that directive, to become the rule, if the latter provision is not to be rendered largely meaningless (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a040 and the case-law cited).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objectives that are capable of justifying a limitation of the rights and obligations laid down, in particular, in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58, the Court has previously held that the list of objectives set out in the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of that directive is exhaustive, as a result of which a legislative measure adopted under that provision must correspond, genuinely and strictly, to one of those objectives (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a041 and the case-law cited).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it is clear from the third sentence in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 that measures taken by the Member States must comply with the general principles of EU law, which include the principle of proportionality, and ensure respect for the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter. In that regard, the Court has previously held that the obligation imposed on providers of electronic communications services by a Member State by way of national legislation to retain traffic data for the purpose of making them available, if necessary, to the competent national authorities raises issues relating to compatibility not only with Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, but also with Article\u00a011 of the Charter, relating to the freedom of expression, which constitutes one of the essential foundations of a pluralist, democratic society, and is one of the values on which, under Article\u00a02 TEU, the European Union is founded (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraphs\u00a042 and 43 and the case-law cited).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be made clear, in that regard, that the retention of traffic and location data constitutes, in itself, first, a derogation from the prohibition laid down in Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2002/58 barring any person other than the users from storing those data, and, secondly, an interference with the fundamental rights to the respect for private life and the protection of personal data, enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, irrespective of whether the information in question relating to private life is sensitive, whether the persons concerned have been inconvenienced in any way on account of that interference, or, furthermore, whether the data retained will or will not be used subsequently (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a044 and the case-law cited).\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion is all the more justified since traffic and location data may reveal information on a significant number of aspects of the private life of the persons concerned, including sensitive information such as sexual orientation, political opinions, religious, philosophical, societal or other beliefs and state of health, given that such data moreover enjoy special protection under EU law. Taken as a whole, those data may allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data have been retained, such as the habits of everyday life, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social relationships of those persons and the social environments frequented by them. In particular, those data provide the means of establishing a profile of the individuals concerned, information that is no less sensitive, having regard to the right to privacy, than the actual content of communications (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a045 and the case-law cited).\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, first, the retention of traffic and location data for policing purposes is liable, in itself, to infringe the right to respect for communications, enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, and to deter users of electronic communications systems from exercising their freedom of expression, guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter, effects that are all the more serious given the quantity and breadth of data retained. Secondly, in view of the significant quantity of traffic and location data that may be continuously retained under a general and indiscriminate retention measure, as well as the sensitive nature of the information that may be gleaned from those data, the mere retention of such data by providers of electronic communications services entails a risk of abuse and unlawful access (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022,\n Commissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a046 and the case-law cited).\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being said, in so far as Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 allows Member States to introduce the derogations referred to in paragraph\u00a051 to 54 above, that provision reflects the fact that the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 of the Charter are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society. Indeed, as can be seen from Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, that provision allows limitations to be placed on the exercise of those rights, provided that those limitations are provided for by law, that they respect the essence of those rights and that, in compliance with the principle of proportionality, they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others. Thus, in order to interpret Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 in the light of the Charter, account must also be taken of the importance of the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a03, 4, 6 and 7 of the Charter and of the importance of the objectives of protecting national security and combating serious crime in contributing to the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a048 and the case-law cited).\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus as regards, in particular, effective action to combat criminal offences committed against, inter alia, minors and other vulnerable persons, it should be borne in mind that positive obligations of the public authorities may result from Article\u00a07 of the Charter, requiring them to adopt legal measures to protect private and family life. Such obligations may also arise from Article\u00a07, concerning the protection of an individual\u2019s home and communications, and Articles\u00a03 and 4, as regards the protection of an individual\u2019s physical and mental integrity and the prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a049 and the case-law cited).\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of those different positive obligations, it is therefore necessary to strike a balance between the various interests and rights at issue and to establish a legal framework which enables such a balance to be struck (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a050 and the case-law cited).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it is clear from the wording itself of the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 that the Member States may adopt a measure derogating from the principle of confidentiality referred to in paragraph\u00a052 above where such a measure is \u2018necessary, appropriate and proportionate within a democratic society\u2019, and recital\u00a011 of the directive specifies, in that respect, that a measure of that nature must be \u2018strictly\u2019 proportionate to the intended purpose.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that the protection of the fundamental right to privacy requires, according to the settled case-law of the Court, that derogations from and limitations on the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. In addition, an objective of general interest may not be pursued without having regard to the fact that it must be reconciled with the fundamental rights affected by the measure, by properly balancing the objective of general interest against the rights at issue (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a052 and the case-law cited).\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, it follows from the Court\u2019s case-law that the question whether the Member States may justify a limitation on the rights and obligations laid down, inter alia, in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58 must be assessed by measuring the seriousness of the interference entailed by such a limitation and by verifying that the importance of the public interest objective pursued by that limitation is proportionate to that seriousness (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a053 and the case-law cited).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to satisfy the requirement of proportionality, the national legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose personal data are affected have sufficient guarantees that those data will be effectively protected against the risk of abuse. That legislation must be legally binding under domestic law and, in particular, must indicate in what circumstances and under which conditions a measure providing for the processing of such data may be adopted, thereby ensuring that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data are subjected to automated processing, in particular where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to those data. Those considerations apply especially where the protection of the particular category of personal data that are sensitive data is at stake (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a054 and the case-law cited).\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, national legislation requiring the retention of personal data must always meet objective criteria that establish a connection between the data to be retained and the objective pursued (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a055 and the case-law cited).\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the public interest objectives that may justify a measure taken pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, it is clear from the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), that, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, there is a hierarchy amongst those objectives according to their respective importance and that the importance of the objective pursued by such a measure must be proportionate to the seriousness of the interference that it entails (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a056).\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, as regards safeguarding national security, the importance of which exceeds that of the other objectives referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, the Court held that that provision, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8, 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, does not preclude legislative measures that allow, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, recourse to an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services to retain, generally and indiscriminately, traffic and location data in situations where the Member State concerned is confronted with a serious threat to national security that is shown to be genuine and present or foreseeable, where the decision imposing such an instruction is subject to effective review, either by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision is binding, the aim of that review being to verify that one of those situations exists and that the conditions and safeguards which must be laid down are observed, and where that instruction may be given only for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary, but which may be extended if that threat persists (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a058 and the case-law cited).\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objective of preventing, investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences, the Court held that, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, only action to combat serious crime and measures to prevent serious threats to public security are capable of justifying serious interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, such as the interference entailed by the retention of traffic and location data. Accordingly, only non-serious interference with those fundamental rights may be justified by the objective of preventing, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences in general (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a059 and the case-law cited).\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objective of combating serious crime, the Court held that national legislation providing, for that purpose, for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data exceeds the limits of what is strictly necessary and cannot be considered to be justified within a democratic society. In view of the sensitive nature of the information that traffic and location data may provide, the confidentiality of those data is essential for the right to privacy. Thus, and also taking into account, first, the dissuasive effect on the exercise of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 11 of the Charter, referred to in paragraph\u00a062 above, which is liable to result from the retention of those data, and, secondly, the seriousness of the interference entailed by such retention, it is necessary, within a democratic society, that retention be the exception and not the rule, as provided for in the system established by Directive 2002/58, and that those data should not be retained systematically and continuously. That conclusion applies even having regard to the objectives of combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security and to the importance that must be attached to them (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a065 and the case-law cited).\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the Court specified that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, does not preclude legislative measures that, for the purposes of combating serous crime and preventing serious threats to public security, provide for:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the targeted retention of traffic and location data which is limited, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, according to the categories of persons concerned or using a geographical criterion, for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary, but which may be extended;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the general and indiscriminate retention of IP addresses assigned to the source of an internet connection for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the general and indiscriminate retention of data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems; and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0recourse to an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services, by means of a decision of the competent authority that is subject to effective judicial review, to undertake, for a specified period of time, the expedited retention (quick freeze) of traffic and location data in the possession of those service providers,\nprovided that those measures ensure, by means of clear and precise rules, that the retention of data at issue is subject to compliance with the applicable substantive and procedural conditions and that the persons concerned have effective safeguards against the risks of abuse (judgments of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0168, and of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a067).\n\u00a0\nA measure providing for general and indiscriminate retention of the majority of traffic and location data for a period of several weeks\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is in the light of those governing considerations that the characteristics of the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, highlighted by the referring court, must be examined.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, as regards the extent of the data retained, it is apparent from the order for reference that, in the context of the provision of telephone services, the retention obligation laid down by that legislation covers, inter alia, the data necessary to identify the source of a communication and its destination, the date and time of the start and end of the communication or\u00a0\u2013 in the case of communication by SMS, multimedia message or similar message\u00a0\u2013 the time of dispatch and receipt of the message and, in the case of mobile use, the designation of the cell sites used by the caller and the recipient at the start of the communication. In the context of the provision of internet access services, the retention obligation covers, inter alia, the IP address assigned to the subscriber, the date and time of the start and end of internet use from the assigned IP address and, in the case of mobile use, the designation of the cell sites used at the beginning of the internet connection. The data enabling the identification of the geographical location and the directions of maximum radiation of the antennas serving the cell site in question are also retained.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings excludes the content of the communication and the data concerning the websites visited from the retention obligation and requires the retention of the cell site designation only at the beginning of the communication, that was also true, in essence, of the national legislation transposing Directive 2006/24 at issue in the cases that gave rise to the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791). Despite those limitations, the Court held in that judgment that the categories of data retained under that directive and those national rules could allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private life of the persons concerned, such as the habits of everyday life, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social relationships of those persons and the social environments frequented by them and, in particular, provide the means of establishing a profile of those persons.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must also be noted that, although the legislation at issue in the main proceedings does not cover the data concerning the websites visited, it nevertheless provides for the retention of IP addresses. Since IP addresses may be used, among other things, to track an internet user\u2019s complete clickstream and, therefore, his or her entire online activity, those data enable a detailed profile of the user to be established. Thus, the retention and analysis of those IP addresses which is required for such tracking constitute a serious interference with the fundamental rights of the internet user enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0153).\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, and as SpaceNet observed in its written observations, the data relating to electronic mail services, although not covered by the retention obligation laid down by the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, represent only a very small part of the data in question.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point\u00a060 of his Opinion, the retention obligation laid down by the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings applies to a very broad set of traffic and location data which corresponds, in essence, to those which led to the settled case-law referred to in paragraph\u00a078 above.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, in response to a question put to it at the hearing, the German Government stated that only 1\u00a0300 entities were listed on the register of persons, authorities or organisations of a social or religious nature whose electronic communications data are not retained under Paragraph\u00a099(2) and Paragraph\u00a0113b(6) of the TKG, which clearly represents a small proportion of all users of telecommunications services in Germany whose data fall within the scope of the retention obligation laid down by the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings. The data of users who are subject to a duty of professional secrecy, such as lawyers, doctors and journalists, are thus retained.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is therefore apparent from the order for reference that the retention of traffic and location data provided for by that national legislation concerns practically the entire population without those persons being, even indirectly, in a situation liable to give rise to criminal prosecutions. Similarly, that legislation requires the general retention, without a reason, and without any distinction in terms of personal, temporal or geographical factors, of most traffic and location data, the scope of which corresponds, in essence, to that of the data retained in the cases which led to the case-law referred to in paragraph\u00a078 above.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, in the light of the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a075 above, a data retention obligation such as that at issue in the main proceedings cannot be regarded as a targeted retention of data, contrary to the submissions of the German Government.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards the data retention period, it follows from the second sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 that the length of the retention period provided for by a national measure imposing a general and indiscriminate retention obligation is indeed a relevant factor, amongst others, in determining whether EU law precludes such a measure, since that sentence requires that that period be \u2018limited\u2019.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is true that those periods\u00a0\u2013 which amount, according to Paragraph\u00a0113b(1) of the TKG, to 4\u00a0weeks for location data and to 10\u00a0weeks for other data\u00a0\u2013 are significantly shorter that those provided for by the national legislation imposing a general and indiscriminate retention obligation examined by the Court in its judgments of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), and of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n (C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258).\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as is apparent from the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a061 above, the seriousness of the interference stems from the risk, particularly in view of their number and variety, that the data retained, taken as a whole, may enable very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private life of the person or persons whose data have been retained and, in particular, provide the means of establishing a profile of the person or persons concerned, information that is no less sensitive, having regard to the right to privacy, than the actual content of communications.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the retention of traffic or location data, that are liable to provide information regarding the communications made by a user of a means of electronic communication or regarding the location of the terminal equipment which he or she uses, is in any event serious regardless of the length of the retention period and the quantity or nature of the data retained, when that set of data is liable to allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private life of the person or persons concerned (see, as regards access to such data, judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraph\u00a039).\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even the retention of a limited quantity of traffic or location data or the retention of those data for a short period are liable to provide very precise information on the private life of a user of a means of electronic communication. Furthermore, the quantity of the data available and the very specific information on the private life of the person concerned that results from the data can be assessed only after the data have been consulted. However, the interference resulting from the retention of those data necessarily occurs before the data and the information resulting therefrom can be consulted. Thus, the assessment of the seriousness of the interference that the retention constitutes is necessarily carried out on the basis of the risk generally pertaining to the category of data retained for the private lives of the persons concerned, without it indeed mattering whether or not the resulting information relating to the person\u2019s private life is in actual fact sensitive (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications),\n C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraph\u00a040).\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, as is apparent from paragraph\u00a077 above and as was confirmed at the hearing, a set of traffic and location data retained for 10\u00a0weeks and 4\u00a0weeks respectively may allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data are retained, such as habits of everyday life, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social relationships of those persons and the social environments frequented by them and, in particular, enable a profile of those persons to be established.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, as regards the safeguards provided for by the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, which are intended to protect the retained data against the risks of abuse and against any unlawful access, it must be emphasised that the retention of and access to those data each constitute, as is clear from the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a060 above, separate interferences with the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 11 of the Charter, requiring a separate justification pursuant to Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter. It follows that national legislation ensuring full respect for the conditions established by the case-law interpreting Directive 2002/58 as regards access to retained data cannot, by its very nature, be capable of either limiting or even remedying the serious interference, which results from the general retention of those data provided for under that national legislation, with the rights guaranteed by Articles\u00a05 and 6 of that directive and by the fundamental rights to which those articles give specific effect (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a047).\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fourth and last place, as regards the European Commission\u2019s argument that particularly serious crime could be treated in the same way as a threat to national security, the Court has already held that the objective of protecting national security corresponds to the primary interest in protecting the essential functions of the State and the fundamental interests of society through the prevention and punishment of activities capable of seriously destabilising the fundamental constitutional, political, economic or social structures of a country and, in particular, of directly threatening society, the population or the State itself, such as terrorist activities (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a061 and the case-law cited).\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike crime, even particularly serious crime, a threat to national security must be genuine and present, or, at the very least, foreseeable, which presupposes that sufficiently concrete circumstances have arisen to be able to justify a generalised and indiscriminate measure of retention of traffic and location data for a limited period of time. Such a threat is therefore distinguishable, by its nature, its seriousness, and the specific nature of the circumstances of which it is constituted, from the general and permanent risk of the occurrence of tensions or disturbances, even of a serious nature, that affect public security, or from that of serious criminal offences being committed (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a062 and the case-law cited).\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, crime, even of a particularly serious nature, cannot be treated in the same way as a threat to national security. To treat those situations in the same way would be likely to create an intermediate category between national security and public security for the purpose of applying to the latter the requirements inherent in the former (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a063).\n\u00a0\nThe measures providing for targeted retention, expedited retention or retention of IP addresses\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several governments, including the French Government, submit that only general and indiscriminate retention enables the efficient achievement of the objectives pursued by the retention measures and the German Government has argued, in essence, that that conclusion is not undermined by the fact that the Member States may have recourse to the targeted retention and expedited retention measures referred to in paragraph\u00a075 above.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be observed, in the first place, that the effectiveness of criminal proceedings generally depends not on a single means of investigation but on all the means of investigation available to the competent national authorities for those purposes (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a069).\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, as interpreted by the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a075 above, allows Member States to adopt, for the purposes of combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, not only measures for targeted retention and expedited retention, but also measures providing for the general and indiscriminate retention, first, of data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems and, secondly, of IP addresses assigned to the source of a connection (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a070).\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, it is common ground that retention of data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems may contribute to the fight against serious crime to the extent that those data make it possible to identify persons who have used those means in the context of planning or committing an act constituting serious crime (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a071).\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 2002/58 does not preclude, for the purposes of combating crime in general, the generalised retention of data relating to civil identity. In those circumstances, it must be stated that neither the directive nor any other EU law act precludes national legislation, which has the purpose of combating serious crime, pursuant to which the purchase of a means of electronic communication, such as a pre-paid SIM card, is subject to a check of official documents establishing the purchaser\u2019s identity and the registration, by the seller, of that information, with the seller being required, should the case arise, to give access to that information to the competent national authorities (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a072).\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it should be recalled that the generalised retention of IP addresses of the source of connection constitutes a serious interference in the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter as those IP addresses may allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private life of the user of the means of electronic communication concerned and may be a deterrent to the exercise of freedom of expression guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter. However, as regards such retention, the Court has held that in order to strike the necessary balance between the rights and interests at issue as required by the case-law referred to in paragraphs\u00a065 to 68 above, it is necessary to take into account, in a case of an offence committed online and, in particular, in cases of the acquisition, dissemination, transmission or making available online of child pornography, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(c) of Directive 2011/93/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13\u00a0December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA (OJ 2011 L\u00a0335, p.\u00a01, and corrigendum OJ 2012 L\u00a018, p.\u00a07), the fact that the IP address might be the only means of investigation enabling the person to whom that address was assigned at the time of the commission of the offence to be identified (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a073).\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, while it is true that a legislative measure providing for the retention of the IP addresses of all natural persons who own terminal equipment permitting access to the internet would catch persons who at first sight have no connection, within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a070 above, with the objectives pursued, and it is also true, in accordance with what has been stated in paragraph\u00a054 above, that internet users are entitled to expect, under Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, that their identity will not, in principle, be disclosed, a legislative measure providing for the general and indiscriminate retention of only IP addresses assigned to the source of a connection does not, in principle, appear to be contrary to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, provided that that possibility is subject to strict compliance with the substantive and procedural conditions which should regulate the use of those data (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0155).\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the seriousness of the interference entailed by that retention with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, only action to combat serious crime, the prevention of serious threats to public security and the safeguarding of national security are capable of justifying that interference. Moreover, the retention period must not exceed what is strictly necessary in the light of the objective pursued. Finally, a measure of that nature must establish strict conditions and safeguards concerning the use of those data, particularly via tracking, with regard to communications made and activities carried out online by the persons concerned (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0156).\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, contrary to the observations of the referring court, there is no tension between paragraphs\u00a0155 and 168 of the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others \n\u00a0\n(C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791). As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in points\u00a081 and 82 of his Opinion, it is clear from that paragraph\u00a0155, read in conjunction with paragraph\u00a0156 and paragraph\u00a0168 of that judgment, that only action to combat serious crime, the prevention of serious threats to public security and the safeguarding of national security are capable of justifying the general retention of IP addresses assigned to the source of a connection, irrespective of whether the persons concerned are liable to have at least an indirect link to the objectives pursued.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, as regards legislative measures providing for a targeted retention and an expedited retention of traffic and location data, some of the arguments put forward by the Member States against such measures show a narrower understanding of the scope of those measures than that set out in the case-law referred to in paragraph\u00a075 above. While, as is recalled in paragraph\u00a057 above, those retention measures are a derogation within the system established by Directive 2002/58, that directive, read in the light of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, does not make the possibility of issuing an order requiring a targeted retention subject to the condition either that the places likely to be the location of a serious crime or the persons suspected of being involved in such an act must be known in advance. Likewise, that directive does not require that the order requiring an expedited retention be limited to suspects identified in advance of that order (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a075).\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, first, targeted retention, the Court has held that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 does not preclude national legislation based on objective evidence which makes it possible to target persons whose traffic and location data are likely to reveal a link, at least an indirect one, with serious criminal offences, to contribute in one way or another to combating serious crime or to preventing a serious risk to public security or a risk to national security (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a076 and the case-law cited).\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court stated, in that regard, that, while the objective evidence may vary according to the nature of the measures taken for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, the persons thus targeted may, in particular, be persons who have been identified beforehand, in the course of the applicable national procedures and on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, as posing a threat to public or national security in the Member State concerned (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a077).\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States thus have, inter alia, the option of imposing retention measures targeting persons who, on the basis of such an identification, are the subject of an investigation or other measures of current surveillance or of a reference in the national criminal record relating to an earlier conviction for serious crimes with a high risk of reoffending. Where that identification is based on objective and non-discriminatory factors, defined in national law, targeted retention in respect of persons thus identified is justified (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a078).\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, a targeted measure for the retention of traffic and location data may, at the choice of the national legislature and in strict compliance with the principle of proportionality, also be set using a geographical criterion where the competent national authorities consider, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, that there exists, in one or more geographical areas, a situation characterised by a high risk of preparation for or commission of serious criminal offences. Those areas may include places with a high incidence of serious crime, places that are particularly vulnerable to serious crime, such as places or infrastructure which regularly receive a very high volume of visitors, or strategic locations, such as airports, stations, maritime ports or tollbooth areas (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a079 and the case-law cited).\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be borne in mind that, according to that case-law, the competent national authorities may adopt, for areas referred to in the preceding paragraph, a targeted measure of retention using a geographic criterion, such as, inter alia, the average crime rate in a geographical area, without that authority necessarily having specific indications as to the preparation or commission, in the areas concerned, of acts of serious crime. Since a targeted retention using that criterion is likely to concern, depending on the serious criminal offences in question and the situation specific to the respective Member States, both the areas marked by a high incidence of serious crime and areas particularly vulnerable to the commission of those acts, it is, in principle, not likely moreover to give rise to discrimination, as the criterion drawn from the average rate of serious crime is, in itself, entirely unconnected with any potentially discriminatory factors (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a080).\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition and above all, a targeted measure of retention covering places or infrastructures which regularly receive a very high volume of visitors, or strategic places, such as airports, stations, maritime ports or tollbooth areas, allows the competent authorities to collect traffic data and, in particular, location data of all persons using, at a specific time, a means of electronic communication in one of those places. Thus, such a targeted retention measure may allow those authorities to obtain, through access to the retained data, information as to the presence of those persons in the places or geographical areas covered by that measure as well as their movements between or within those areas and to draw, for the purposes of combating serious crime, conclusions as to their presence and activity in those places or geographical areas at a specific time during the period of retention (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a081).\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that the geographic areas covered by such a targeted retention measure may and, where appropriate, must be amended in accordance with changes in the circumstances that justified their selection, thus making it possible to react to developments in the fight against serious crime. The Court has held that the duration of those targeted retention measures described in paragraphs\u00a0105 to 110 above must not exceed what is strictly necessary in the light of the objective pursued and the circumstances justifying them, without prejudice to the possibility of extending those measures should such retention continue to be necessary (judgments of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others,\n C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0151, and of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a082).\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the possibility of providing distinctive criteria other than a personal or geographic criterion for the targeted retention of traffic and location data, it is possible that other objective and non-discriminatory criteria may be considered in order to ensure that the scope of a targeted retention measure is as limited as is strictly necessary and to establish a connection, at least indirectly, between serious criminal acts and the persons whose data are retained. However, since Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 refers to legislative measures of the Member States, it is for the latter and not for the Court to identify those criteria, it being understood that there can be no question of reinstating, by that means, the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a083).\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a050 of his Opinion, the fact that it may be difficult to provide a detailed definition of the circumstances and conditions under which targeted retention may be carried out is no reason for the Member States, by turning the exception into a rule, to provide for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a084).\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, secondly, the expedited retention of traffic and location data processed and stored by providers of electronic communications services on the basis of Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58 or on the basis of legislative measures taken under Article\u00a015(1) of that directive, it should be noted that those data must, in principle, be erased or made anonymous, depending on the circumstances, at the end of the statutory periods within which those data must be processed and stored in accordance with the national provisions transposing that directive. Nevertheless, the Court has held that during that processing and storage, situations may arise in which it becomes necessary to retain those data after those time periods have ended in order to shed light on serious criminal offences or acts adversely affecting national security; this is the case both in situations where those offences or acts having adverse effects have already been established and where, after an objective examination of all of the relevant circumstances, such offences or acts having adverse effects may reasonably be suspected (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a085).\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In such a situation, in the light of the balance that must be struck between the rights and interests at issue referred to in paragraphs\u00a065 to 68 above, it is permissible for Member States to provide, in legislation adopted pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, for the possibility of instructing, by means of a decision of the competent authority subject to effective judicial review, providers of electronic communications services to undertake the expedited retention of traffic and location data at their disposal for a specified period of time (judgments of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0163, and of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a086).\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent that the purpose of that expedited retention no longer corresponds to the purpose for which those data were initially collected and retained and since any processing of data must, under Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter, be consistent with specified purposes, Member States must make clear, in their legislation, for what purpose the expedited retention of data may occur. In the light of the serious nature of the interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter which such retention may entail, only actions to combat serious crime and, a fortiori, to safeguard national security are such as to justify such interference, on the condition that the measure and access to the retained data comply with the limits of what is strictly necessary, as set out in paragraphs\u00a0164 to 167 of the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others \n(C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791) (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a087).\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has stated that a measure of retention of that nature need not be limited to the data of persons who have been identified previously as being a threat to public security or national security of the Member State concerned or of persons specifically suspected of having committed a serious criminal offence or acts adversely affecting national security. According to the Court, while it must comply with the framework established by Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, and taking into account the considerations set out in paragraph\u00a070 above, such a measure may, at the choice of the national legislature and subject to the limits of what is strictly necessary, be extended to traffic and location data relating to persons other than those who are suspected of having planned or committed a serious criminal offence or acts adversely affecting national security, provided that those data can, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, shed light on such an offence or acts adversely affecting national security, such as data concerning the victim thereof, and his or her social or professional circle (judgments of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0165, and of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a088).\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, a legislative measure may authorise the issuing of an instruction to providers of electronic communications services to carry out the expedited retention of traffic and location data, inter alia, of persons with whom, prior to the serious threat to public security arising or a serious crime being committed, a victim was in contact via those electronic means of communications (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a089).\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such expedited retention may, according to the Court\u2019s case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a0117 above and under the same conditions as those referred to in that paragraph, also be extended to specific geographic areas, such as the places of the commission of or preparation for the offence or attack on national security in question. It should be stated that the subject matter of such a measure may also be the traffic and location data relating to a place where a person, possibly the victim of a serious crime, has disappeared, on condition that that measure and access to the data so retained comply with the limits of what is strictly necessary, as set out in paragraphs\u00a0164 to 167 of the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791) (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a090).\n120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it must be stated that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 does not preclude the competent national authorities from ordering a measure of expedited retention at the first stage of an investigation into a serious threat to public security or a possible serious crime, namely from the time when those authorities may, in accordance with the relevant provisions of national law, commence such an investigation (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a091).\n121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again as regards the variety of measures for the retention of traffic and location data referred to in paragraph\u00a075 above, it must be stated that those various measures may, at the choice of the national legislature and subject to the limits of what is strictly necessary, be applied concurrently. Accordingly, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, as interpreted by case-law resulting from the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), does not preclude a combination of those measures (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a092).\n122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fourth and final place, it must be emphasised that the proportionality of the measures adopted pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 requires, according to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, as recalled in the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others \n\u00a0\n(C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), compliance not only with the requirements of aptitude and of necessity but also with that of the proportionate nature of those measures in relation to the objective pursued \n\u00a0\n(judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a093).\n123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should be recalled that, in paragraph\u00a051 of its judgment of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n (C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238), the Court held that while the fight against serious crime is indeed of the utmost importance in order to ensure public security and its effectiveness may depend to a great extent on the use of modern investigation techniques, that objective of general interest, however fundamental it may be, does not, in itself, justify that a measure providing for the general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data, such as that established by Directive 2006/24, should be considered to be necessary (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a094).\n124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the same vein, the Court stated, in paragraph\u00a0145 of the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others \n(\nC-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), that even the positive obligations of the Member States which may arise, depending on the circumstances, from Articles\u00a03, 4 and 7 of the Charter and which relate, as pointed out in paragraph\u00a064 above, to the establishment of rules to facilitate effective action to combat criminal offences, cannot have the effect of justifying interference that is as serious as that entailed by national legislation providing for the retention of traffic and location data with the fundamental rights, enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, of practically the entire population, in circumstances where the data of the persons concerned are not liable to disclose a link, at least an indirect one, between those data and the objective pursued (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a095).\n125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights of 25\u00a0May 2021, \nBig Brother Watch and Others v. the United Kingdom\n (CE:ECHR:2021:0525JUD005817013), and of 25\u00a0May 2021, \nCentrum f\u00f6r R\u00e4ttvisa v. Sweden\n (CE:ECHR:2021:0525JUD003525208), relied on by certain governments at the hearing to argue that the ECHR does not preclude national legislation providing, in essence, for a general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data, cannot call into question the interpretation of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 resulting from the foregoing considerations. Those judgments concerned the bulk interception of data relating to international communications. Thus, as the Commission observed at the hearing, the European Court of Human Rights did not rule, in those judgments, on the compatibility with the ECHR of a general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data on national territory or even a large-scale interception of those data for the purposes of the prevention, detection and investigation of serious criminal offences. In any event, it should be borne in mind that Article\u00a052(3) of the Charter is intended to ensure the necessary consistency between the rights contained in the Charter and the corresponding rights guaranteed in the ECHR, without adversely affecting the autonomy of EU law and that of the Court of Justice of the European Union, with the result that, for the purpose of interpreting the Charter, account must be taken of the corresponding rights of the ECHR only as the minimum threshold of protection (judgment of 17\u00a0December 2020, \nCentraal Isra\u00eblitisch Consistorie van Belgi\u00eb and Others\n, C-336/19, EU:C:2020:1031, paragraph\u00a056).\n\u00a0\nAccess to data that have been retained in a general and indiscriminate way\n126\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the hearing, the Danish Government argued that the competent national authorities should be able to access, for the purpose of combating serious crime, traffic and location data that have been retained in a general and indiscriminate way, in accordance with the case-law arising from the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraphs\u00a0135 to 139), in order to confront a serious threat to national security which is shown to be genuine and present or foreseeable.\n127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be observed, first of all, that authorising access, for the purpose of combating serious crime, to traffic and location data which have been retained in a general and indiscriminate way would make that access depend upon circumstances unrelated to that objective, according to whether or not, in the Member State concerned, there was a serious threat to national security as referred to in the preceding paragraph, whereas, in view of the sole objective of the fight against serious crime which must justify the retention of those data and access thereto, there is nothing to justify a difference in treatment, in particular as between the Member States (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a097).\n128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has already held, access to traffic and location data retained by providers of electronic communications services in accordance with a measure taken under Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, which must be given effect in full compliance with the conditions resulting from the case-law interpreting that directive, may, in principle, be justified only by the public interest objective for which those providers were ordered to retain those data. It is otherwise only if the importance of the objective pursued by access is greater than that of the objective which justified retention (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a098).\n129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Danish Government\u2019s argument refers to a situation in which the objective pursued by the access request proposed, namely the fight against serious crime, is of lesser importance in the hierarchy of objectives of public interest than that which justified the retention, namely the safeguarding of national security. To authorise, in that situation, access to retained data would be contrary to that hierarchy of public interest objectives recalled in the preceding paragraph and in paragraphs\u00a068, 71, 72 and 73 above (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a099).\n130\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition and moreover, in accordance with the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a074 above, traffic and location data cannot be the object of general and indiscriminate retention for the purpose of combating serious crime and, therefore, access to those data cannot be justified for that same purpose. Where those data have exceptionally been retained in a general and indiscriminate way for the purpose of safeguarding national security against a genuine and present or foreseeable threat, in the circumstances referred to in paragraph\u00a071 above, the national authorities competent to undertake criminal investigations cannot access those data in the context of criminal proceedings, without depriving of any effectiveness the prohibition on such retention for the purpose of combating serious crime, recalled in paragraph\u00a074 above (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0100).\n131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred for a preliminary ruling is that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislative measures which provide, on a preventative basis, for the purposes of combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data. However, that Article\u00a015(1), read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as not precluding national legislative measures that:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0allow, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, recourse to an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services to retain, generally and indiscriminately, traffic and location data in situations where the Member State concerned is confronted with a serious threat to national security that is shown to be genuine and present or foreseeable, where the decision imposing such an instruction is subject to effective review, either by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision is binding, the aim of that review being to verify that one of those situations exists and that the conditions and safeguards which must be laid down are observed, and where that instruction may be given only for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary, but which may be extended if that threat persists;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0provide, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, for the targeted retention of traffic and location data which is limited, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, according to the categories of persons concerned or using a geographical criterion, for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary, but which may be extended;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0provide, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, for the general and indiscriminate retention of IP addresses assigned to the source of an internet connection for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0provide, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, combating crime and safeguarding public security, for the general and indiscriminate retention of data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0allow, for the purposes of combating serious crime and, a fortiori, safeguarding national security, recourse to an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services, by means of a decision of the competent authority that is subject to effective judicial review, to undertake, for a specified period of time, the expedited retention of traffic and location data in the possession of those service providers,\nprovided that those measures ensure, by means of clear and precise rules, that the retention of data at issue is subject to compliance with the applicable substantive and procedural conditions and that the persons concerned have effective safeguards against the risks of abuse.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nmust be interpreted as meaning that:\nit precludes national legislative measures which provide, on a preventative basis, for the purposes of combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data;\nit does not preclude legislative measures that:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nallow, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, recourse to an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services to retain, generally and indiscriminately, traffic and location data in situations where the Member State concerned is confronted with a serious threat to national security that is shown to be genuine and present or foreseeable, where the decision imposing such an instruction is subject to effective review, either by a court or by an independent administrative body whose decision is binding, the aim of that review being to verify that one of those situations exists and that the conditions and safeguards which must be laid down are observed, and where that instruction may be given only for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary, but which may be extended if that threat persists;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nprovide, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, for the targeted retention of traffic and location data which is limited, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory factors, according to the categories of persons concerned or using a geographical criterion, for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary, but which may be extended;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nprovide, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, combating serious crime and preventing serious threats to public security, for the general and indiscriminate retention of IP addresses assigned to the source of an internet connection for a period that is limited in time to what is strictly necessary;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nprovide, for the purposes of safeguarding national security, combating crime and safeguarding public security, for the general and indiscriminate retention of data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nallow, for the purposes of combating serious crime and, a fortiori, safeguarding national security, recourse to an instruction requiring providers of electronic communications services, by means of a decision of the competent authority that is subject to effective judicial review, to undertake, for a specified period of time, the expedited retention of traffic and location data in the possession of those service providers,\nprovided that those measures ensure, by means of clear and precise rules, that the retention of data at issue is subject to compliance with the applicable substantive and procedural conditions and that the persons concerned have effective safeguards against the risks of abuse."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 21 Dec 2016, C-203/15 (\nTele2 Sverige\n)\nCharter of fundamental

The data concerned is that relating to subscriptions and all electronic communications necessary to trace and identify the source and destination of a communication; to determine its date, time, and type; to identify the communications equipment used and to establish the location of mobile communication equipment used at the start and end of each communication. The data which there is an obligation to retain is data generated or processed in the context of telephony services, telephony services which use a mobile connection, electronic messaging systems, internet access services and internet access capacity (connection mode) provision services.

As regards telephony services using an IP packet, data to be retained includes, in addition to data mentioned above, data relating to the IP addresses of the caller and the person called. As regards electronic messaging systems, data to be retained includes data relating to the numbers of senders and recipients, IP addresses or other messaging addresses.

In additions, the requirements of the Data Protection Act must be adhered to.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with paragraph\u00a07.18 of the Code of Practice, where a United Kingdom public authority is considering the possible disclosure to overseas authorities of communications data, it must, inter alia, consider whether that data will be adequately protected. However, it is stated in paragraph\u00a07.22 of that code that a transfer of data to a third country may take place where that transfer is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, even where the third country does not provide an adequate level of protection. On the information given by the referring court in Case C-698/15, the Secretary of State for the Home Department may issue a national security certificate that exempts certain data from the provisions of the legislation.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In paragraph\u00a08.1 of that code, it is stated that RIPA established the Interception of Communications Commissioner (United Kingdom), whose remit is, inter alia, to provide independent oversight of the exercise and performance of the powers and duties contained in Chapter II of Part I of RIPA.\u00a0As is stated in paragraph\u00a08.3 of the code, the Commissioner may, where he can \u2018establish that an individual has been adversely affected by any wilful or reckless failure\u2019, inform that individual of suspected unlawful use of powers.\n\u00a0\nThe disputes in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\u00a0\nCase C-203/15\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 9\u00a0April 2014, Tele2 Sverige, a provider of electronic communications services established in Sweden, informed the PTS that, following the ruling in the judgment of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n (C-293/12 and C-594/12; \u2018the \nDigital Rights\n judgment\u2019, EU:C:2014:238) that Directive 2006/24 was invalid, it would cease, as from 14\u00a0April 2014, to retain electronic communications data, covered by the LEK, and that it would erase data retained prior to that date.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 15\u00a0April 2014, the Rikspolisstyrelsen (the Swedish National Police Authority, Sweden) sent to the PTS a complaint to the effect that Tele2 Sverige had ceased to send to it the data concerned.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 29\u00a0April 2014, the justitieminister (Swedish Minister for Justice) appointed a special reporter to examine the Swedish legislation at issue in the light of the \nDigital Rights\n judgment. In a report dated 13\u00a0June 2014, entitled \u2018Datalagring, EU-r\u00e4tten och svensk r\u00e4tt, Ds 2014:23\u2019 (Data retention, EU law and Swedish law; \u2018the 2014 report\u2019), the special reporter concluded that the national legislation on the retention of data, as set out in Paragraphs\u00a016a to 16f of the LEK, was not incompatible with either EU law or the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950 (\u2018the ECHR\u2019). The special reporter emphasised that the \nDigital Rights\n judgment could not be interpreted as meaning that the general and indiscriminate retention of data was to be condemned as a matter of principle. From his perspective, neither should the \nDigital Rights\n judgment be understood as meaning that the Court had established, in that judgment, a set of criteria all of which had to be satisfied if legislation was to be able to be regarded as proportionate. He considered that it was necessary to assess all the circumstances in order to determine the compatibility of the Swedish legislation with EU law, such as the extent of data retention in the light of the provisions on access to data, on the duration of retention, and on the protection and the security of data.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On that basis, on 19\u00a0June 2014 the PTS informed Tele2 Sverige that it was in breach of its obligations under the national legislation in failing to retain the data covered by the LEK for six months, for the purpose of combating crime. By an order of 27\u00a0June 2014, the PTS ordered Tele2 Sverige to commence, by no later than 25\u00a0July 2014, the retention of that data.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tele2 Sverige considered that the 2014 report was based on a misinterpretation of the \nDigital Rights\n judgment and that the obligation to retain data was in breach of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter, and therefore brought an action before the F\u00f6rvaltningsr\u00e4tten i Stockholm (Administrative Court, Stockholm) challenging the order of 27\u00a0June 2014. Since that court dismissed the action, by judgment of 13\u00a0October 2014, Tele2 Sverige brought an appeal against that judgment before the referring court.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the opinion of the referring court, the compatibility of the Swedish legislation with EU law should be assessed with regard to Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58. While that directive establishes the general rule that traffic and location data should be erased or made anonymous when no longer required for the transmission of a communication, Article\u00a015(1) of that directive introduces a derogation from that general rule since it permits the Member States, where justified on one of the specified grounds, to restrict that obligation to erase or render anonymous, or even to make provision for the retention of data. Accordingly, EU law allows, in certain situations, the retention of electronic communications data.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court nonetheless seeks to ascertain whether a general and indiscriminate obligation to retain electronic communications data, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, is compatible, taking into consideration the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter. Given that the opinions of the parties differ on that point, it is necessary that the Court give an unequivocal ruling on whether, as maintained by Tele2 Sverige, the general and indiscriminate retention of electronic communications data is per se incompatible with Articles\u00a07 and 8 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, or whether, as stated in the 2014 Report, the compatibility of such retention of data is to be assessed in the light of provisions relating to access to the data, the protection and security of the data and the duration of retention.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the Kammarr\u00e4tten i Stockholm (Administrative Court of Appeal of Stockholm, Sweden) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer to the Court the following questions for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is a general obligation to retain traffic data covering all persons, all means of electronic communication and all traffic data without any distinctions, limitations or exceptions for the purpose of combating crime \u2026 compatible with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC, taking account of Articles\u00a07 and 8 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter? \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the answer to question 1 is in the negative, may the retention nevertheless be permitted where:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0access by the national authorities to the retained data is determined as [described in paragraphs\u00a019 to 36 of the order for reference], and \n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0data protection and security requirements are regulated as [described in paragraphs\u00a038 to 43 of the order for reference], and\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0all relevant data is to be retained for six months, calculated as from the day when the communication is ended, and subsequently erased as [described in paragraph\u00a037 of the order for reference]?\u2019\n\u00a0\nCase C-698/15\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Watson, Mr\u00a0Brice and Mr\u00a0Lewis each lodged, before the High Court of Justice (England & Wales), Queen\u2019s Bench Division (Divisional Court) (United Kingdom), applications for judicial review of the legality of Section 1 of DRIPA, claiming, inter alia, that that section is incompatible with Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter and Article\u00a08 of the ECHR.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By judgment of 17\u00a0July 2015, the High Court of Justice (England & Wales), Queen\u2019s Bench Division (Divisional Court) held that the \nDigital Rights\n judgment laid down \u2018mandatory requirements of EU law\u2019 applicable to the legislation of Member States on the retention of communications data and access to such data. According to the High Court of Justice, since the Court, in that judgment, held that Directive 2006/24 was incompatible with the principle of proportionality, national legislation containing the same provisions as that directive could, equally, not be compatible with that principle. It follows from the underlying logic of the \nDigital Rights\n judgment that legislation that establishes a general body of rules for the retention of communications data is in breach of the rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, unless that legislation is complemented by a body of rules for access to the data, defined by national law, which provides sufficient safeguards to protect those rights. Accordingly, Section 1 of DRIPA is not compatible with Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter in so far as it does not lay down clear and precise rules providing for access to and use of retained data and in so far as access to that data is not made dependent on prior review by a court or an independent administrative body.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Secretary of State for the Home Department brought an appeal against that judgment before the Court of Appeal (England & Wales) (Civil Division) (United Kingdom).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court states that Section 1(1) of DRIPA empowers the Secretary of State for the Home Department to adopt, without any prior authorisation from a court or an independent administrative body, a general regime requiring public telecommunications operators to retain all data relating to any postal service or any telecommunications service for a maximum period of 12 months if he/she considers that such a requirement is necessary and proportionate to achieve the purposes stated in the United Kingdom legislation. Even though that data does not include the content of a communication, it could be highly intrusive into the privacy of users of communications services.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the order for reference and in its judgment of 20\u00a0November 2015, delivered in the appeal procedure, wherein it decided to send to the Court this request for a preliminary ruling, the referring court considers that the national rules on the retention of data necessarily fall within the scope of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 and must therefore conform to the requirements of the Charter. However, as stated in Article\u00a01(3) of that directive, the EU legislature did not harmonise the rules relating to access to retained data.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the effect of the \nDigital Rights\n judgment on the issues raised in the main proceedings, the referring court states that, in the case that gave rise to that judgment, the Court was considering the validity of Directive 2006/24 and not the validity of any national legislation. Having regard, inter alia, to the close relationship between the retention of data and access to that data, it was essential that that directive should incorporate a set of safeguards and that the \nDigital Rights\n judgment should analyse, when examining the lawfulness of the data retention regime established by that directive, the rules relating to access to that data. The Court had not therefore intended to lay down, in that judgment, mandatory requirements applicable to national legislation on access to data that does not implement EU law. Further, the reasoning of the Court was closely linked to the objective pursued by Directive 2006/24. National legislation should, however, be assessed in the light of the objectives pursued by that legislation and its context.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the need to refer questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling, the referring court draws attention to the fact that, when the order for reference was issued, six courts in other Member States, five of those courts being courts of last resort, had declared national legislation to be invalid on the basis of the \nDigital Rights\n judgment. The answer to the questions referred is therefore not obvious, although the answer is required to give a ruling on the cases brought before that court.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal (England & Wales) (Civil Division) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer to the Court the following questions for a preliminary ruling: \n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does [the \nDigital Rights\n judgment] (including, in particular, paragraphs\u00a060 to 62 thereof) lay down mandatory requirements of EU law applicable to a Member State\u2019s domestic regime governing access to data retained in accordance with national legislation, in order to comply with Articles\u00a07 and 8 of [the Charter]?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does [the \nDigital Rights\n judgment] expand the scope of Articles\u00a07 and/or 8 of [the Charter] beyond that of Article\u00a08 of the European Convention of Human Rights \u2026 as established in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights \u2026?\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe procedure before the Court\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By order of 1\u00a0February 2016, \nDavis and Others\n (C-698/15, not published, EU:C:2016:70), the President of the Court decided to grant the request of the Court of Appeal (England & Wales) (Civil Division) that Case C-698/15 should be dealt with under the expedited procedure provided for in Article\u00a0105(1) of the Court\u2019s Rules of Procedure.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of the President of the Court of 10\u00a0March 2016, Cases C-203/15 and C-698/15 were joined for the purposes of the oral part of the procedure and the judgment.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\u00a0\nThe first question in Case C-203/15\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the first question in Case C-203/15, the Kammarr\u00e4tten i Stockholm (Administrative Court of Appeal, Stockholm) seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings that provides, for the purpose of fighting crime, for general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data of all subscribers and registered users with respect to all means of electronic communications.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That question arises, in particular, from the fact that Directive 2006/24, which the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings was intended to transpose, was declared to be invalid by the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, though the parties disagree on the scope of that judgment and its effect on that legislation, given that it governs the retention of traffic and location data and access to that data by the national authorities.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is necessary first to examine whether national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceeding falls within the scope of EU law.\n\u00a0The scope of Directive 2002/58\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Member States that have submitted written observations to the Court have differed in their opinions as to whether and to what extent national legislation on the retention of traffic and location data and access to that data by the national authorities, for the purpose of combating crime, falls within the scope of Directive 2002/58. Whereas, in particular, the Belgian, Danish, German and Estonian Governments, Ireland and the Netherlands Government have expressed the opinion that the answer is that it does, the Czech Government has proposed that the answer is that it does not, since the sole objective of such legislation is to combat crime. The United Kingdom Government, for its part, argues that only legislation relating to the retention of data, but not legislation relating to the access to that data by the competent national law enforcement authorities, falls within the scope of that directive.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, finally, the Commission, while it maintained, in its written observations submitted to the Court in Case C-203/15, that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings falls within the scope of Directive 2002/58, the Commission argues, in its written observations in Case C-698/15, that only national rules relating to the retention of data, and not those relating to the access of the national authorities to that data, fall within the scope of that directive. The latter rules should, however, according to the Commission, be taken into consideration in order to assess whether national legislation governing the retention of data by providers of electronic communications services constitutes a proportionate interference in the fundamental rights guaranteed in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be observed that a determination of the scope of Directive 2002/58 must take into consideration, inter alia, the general structure of that directive.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2002/58 indicates that the directive provides, inter alia, for the harmonisation of the provisions of national law required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy and confidentiality, with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01(3) of that directive excludes from its scope \u2018activities of the State\u2019 in specified fields, including the activities of the State in areas of criminal law and in the areas of public security, defence and State security, including the economic well-being of the State when the activities relate to State security matters (see, by analogy, with respect to the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, judgments of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a043, and of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a041).\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03 of Directive 2002/58 states that the directive is to apply to the processing of personal data in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services in public communications networks in the European Union, including public communications networks supporting data collection and identification devices (\u2018electronic communications services\u2019). Consequently, that directive must be regarded as regulating the activities of the providers of such services.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 states that Member States may adopt, subject to the conditions laid down, \u2018legislative measures to restrict the scope of the rights and obligations provided for in Article\u00a05, Article\u00a06, Article\u00a08(1), (2), (3) and (4), and Article\u00a09 [of that directive]\u2019. The second sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of that directive identifies, as an example of measures that may thus be adopted by Member States, measures \u2018providing for the retention of data\u2019.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Admittedly, the legislative measures that are referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 concern activities characteristic of States or State authorities, and are unrelated to fields in which individuals are active (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008, \nPromusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraph\u00a051). Moreover, the objectives which, under that provision, such measures must pursue, such as safeguarding national security, defence and public security and the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of unauthorised use of the electronic communications system, overlap substantially with the objectives pursued by the activities referred to in Article\u00a01(3) of that directive.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, having regard to the general structure of Directive 2002/58, the factors identified in the preceding paragraph of this judgment do not permit the conclusion that the legislative measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 are excluded from the scope of that directive, for otherwise that provision would be deprived of any purpose. Indeed, Article\u00a015(1) necessarily presupposes that the national measures referred to therein, such as those relating to the retention of data for the purpose of combating crime, fall within the scope of that directive, since it expressly authorises the Member States to adopt them only if the conditions laid down in the directive are met.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, the legislative measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 govern, for the purposes mentioned in that provision, the activity of providers of electronic communications services. Accordingly, Article\u00a015(1), read together with Article\u00a03 of that directive, must be interpreted as meaning that such legislative measures fall within the scope of that directive.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scope of that directive extends, in particular, to a legislative measure, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, that requires such providers to retain traffic and location data, since to do so necessarily involves the processing, by those providers, of personal data.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scope of that directive also extends to a legislative measure relating, as in the main proceedings, to the access of the national authorities to the data retained by the providers of electronic communications services. \n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The protection of the confidentiality of electronic communications and related traffic data, guaranteed in Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2002/58, applies to the measures taken by all persons other than users, whether private persons or bodies or State bodies. As confirmed in recital 21 of that directive, the aim of the directive is to prevent unauthorised access to communications, including \u2018any data related to such communications\u2019, in order to protect the confidentiality of electronic communications.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, a legislative measure whereby a Member State, on the basis of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, requires providers of electronic communications services, for the purposes set out in that provision, to grant national authorities, on the conditions laid down in such a measure, access to the data retained by those providers, concerns the processing of personal data by those providers, and that processing falls within the scope of that directive.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, since data is retained only for the purpose, when necessary, of making that data accessible to the competent national authorities, national legislation that imposes the retention of data necessarily entails, in principle, the existence of provisions relating to access by the competent national authorities to the data retained by the providers of electronic communications services.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is confirmed by Article\u00a015(1b) of Directive 2002/58, which provides that providers are to establish internal procedures for responding to requests for access to users\u2019 personal data, based on provisions of national law adopted pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of that directive.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings in Cases C-203/15 and C-698/15, falls within the scope of Directive 2002/58.\n\u00a0The interpretation of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8, 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be observed that, according to Article\u00a01(2) of Directive 2002/58, the provisions of that directive \u2018particularise and complement\u2019 Directive 95/46. As stated in its recital 2, Directive 2002/58 seeks to ensure, in particular, full respect for the rights set out in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter. In that regard, it is clear from the explanatory memorandum of the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (COM(2000) 385 final), which led to Directive 2002/58, that the EU legislature sought \u2018to ensure that a high level of protection of personal data and privacy will continue to be guaranteed for all electronic communications services regardless of the technology used\u2019.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, Directive 2002/58 contains specific provisions designed, as is apparent from, in particular, recitals 6 and 7 of that directive, to offer to the users of electronic communications services protection against risks to their personal data and privacy that arise from new technology and the increasing capacity for automated storage and processing of data.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, Article\u00a05(1) of that directive provides that the Member States must ensure, by means of their national legislation, the confidentiality of communications effected by means of a public communications network and publicly available electronic communications services, and the confidentiality of the related traffic data.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principle of confidentiality of communications established by Directive 2002/58 implies, inter alia, as stated in the second sentence of Article\u00a05(1) of that directive, that, as a general rule, any person other than the users is prohibited from storing, without the consent of the users concerned, the traffic data related to electronic communications. The only exceptions relate to persons lawfully authorised in accordance with Article\u00a015(1) of that directive and to the technical storage necessary for conveyance of a communication (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008, \nPromusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraph\u00a047).\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, as confirmed by recitals 22 and 26 of Directive 2002/58, under Article\u00a06 of that directive, the processing and storage of traffic data are permitted only to the extent necessary and for the time necessary for the billing and marketing of services and the provision of value added services (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008, \nPromusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraphs\u00a047 and 48). As regards, in particular, the billing of services, that processing is permitted only up to the end of the period during which the bill may be lawfully challenged or legal proceedings brought to obtain payment. Once that period has elapsed, the data processed and stored must be erased or made anonymous. As regards location data other than traffic data, Article\u00a09(1) of that directive provides that that data may be processed only subject to certain conditions and after it has been made anonymous or the consent of the users or subscribers obtained.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scope of Article\u00a05, Article\u00a06 and Article\u00a09(1) of Directive 2002/58, which seek to ensure the confidentiality of communications and related data, and to minimise the risks of misuse, must moreover be assessed in the light of recital 30 of that directive, which states: \u2018Systems for the provision of electronic communications networks and services should be designed to limit the amount of personal data necessary to a strict minimum\u2019.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Admittedly, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 enables the Member States to introduce exceptions to the obligation of principle, laid down in Article\u00a05(1) of that directive, to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, and to the corresponding obligations, referred to in Articles\u00a06 and 9 of that directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008, \nPromusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraph\u00a050).\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nonetheless, in so far as Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 enables Member States to restrict the scope of the obligation of principle to ensure the confidentiality of communications and related traffic data, that provision must, in accordance with the Court\u2019s settled case-law, be interpreted strictly (see, by analogy, judgment of 22\u00a0November 2012, \nProbst\n, C-119/12, EU:C:2012:748, paragraph\u00a023). That provision cannot, therefore, permit the exception to that obligation of principle and, in particular, to the prohibition on storage of data, laid down in Article\u00a05 of Directive 2002/58, to become the rule, if the latter provision is not to be rendered largely meaningless.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must, in that regard, be observed that the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 provides that the objectives pursued by the legislative measures that it covers, which derogate from the principle of confidentiality of communications and related traffic data, must be \u2018to safeguard national security\u00a0\u2014 that is, State security\u00a0\u2014 defence, public security, and the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of unauthorised use of the electronic communication system\u2019, or one of the other objectives specified in Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 95/46, to which the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 refers (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008,\n Promusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraph\u00a053). That list of objectives is exhaustive, as is apparent from the second sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, which states that the legislative measures must be justified on \u2018the grounds laid down\u2019 in the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of that directive. Accordingly, the Member States cannot adopt such measures for purposes other than those listed in that latter provision.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, the third sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 provides that \u2018[a]ll the measures referred to [in Article\u00a015(1)] shall be in accordance with the general principles of [European Union] law, including those referred to in Article\u00a06(1) and (2) [EU]\u2019, which include the general principles and fundamental rights now guaranteed by the Charter. Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 must, therefore, be interpreted in the light of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 95/46, judgments of 20\u00a0May 2003, \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01, EU:C:2003:294, paragraph\u00a068; of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a068, and of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a038).\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be emphasised that the obligation imposed on providers of electronic communications services, by national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, to retain traffic data in order, when necessary, to make that data available to the competent national authorities, raises questions relating to compatibility not only with Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, which are expressly referred to in the questions referred for a preliminary ruling, but also with the freedom of expression guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraphs\u00a025 and 70).\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the importance both of the right to privacy, guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, and of the right to protection of personal data, guaranteed in Article\u00a08 of the Charter, as derived from the Court\u2019s case-law (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a039 and the case-law cited), must be taken into consideration in interpreting Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58. The same is true of the right to freedom of expression in the light of the particular importance accorded to that freedom in any democratic society. That fundamental right, guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter, constitutes one of the essential foundations of a pluralist, democratic society, and is one of the values on which, under Article\u00a02 TEU, the Union is founded (see, to that effect, judgments of 12\u00a0June 2003, \nSchmidberger\n, C-112/00, EU:C:2003:333, paragraph\u00a079, and of 6\u00a0September 2011, \nPatriciello\n, C-163/10, EU:C:2011:543, paragraph\u00a031).\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be recalled that, under Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by the Charter must be provided for by law and must respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. With due regard to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be imposed on the exercise of those rights and freedoms only if they are necessary and if they genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others (judgment of 15\u00a0February 2016, \nN.\n, C-601/15 PPU, EU:C:2016:84, paragraph\u00a050).\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to that last issue, the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 provides that Member States may adopt a measure that derogates from the principle of confidentiality of communications and related traffic data where it is a \u2018necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society\u2019, in view of the objectives laid down in that provision. As regards recital 11 of that directive, it states that a measure of that kind must be \u2018strictly\u2019 proportionate to the intended purpose. In relation to, in particular, the retention of data, the requirement laid down in the second sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of that directive is that data should be retained \u2018for a limited period\u2019 and be \u2018justified\u2019 by reference to one of the objectives stated in the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of that directive.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Due regard to the principle of proportionality also derives from the Court\u2019s settled case-law to the effect that the protection of the fundamental right to respect for private life at EU level requires that derogations from and limitations on the protection of personal data should apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (judgments of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a056; of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraph\u00a077; the \nDigital Rights \njudgment, paragraph\u00a052, and of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a092).\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards whether national legislation, such as that at issue in Case C-203/15, satisfies those conditions, it must be observed that that legislation provides for a general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data of all subscribers and registered users relating to all means of electronic communication, and that it imposes on providers of electronic communications services an obligation to retain that data systematically and continuously, with no exceptions. As stated in the order for reference, the categories of data covered by that legislation correspond, in essence, to the data whose retention was required by Directive 2006/24.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The data which providers of electronic communications services must therefore retain makes it possible to trace and identify the source of a communication and its destination, to identify the date, time, duration and type of a communication, to identify users\u2019 communication equipment, and to establish the location of mobile communication equipment. That data includes, inter alia, the name and address of the subscriber or registered user, the telephone number of the caller, the number called and an IP address for internet services. That data makes it possible, in particular, to identify the person with whom a subscriber or registered user has communicated and by what means, and to identify the time of the communication as well as the place from which that communication took place. Further, that data makes it possible to know how often the subscriber or registered user communicated with certain persons in a given period (see, by analogy, with respect to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraph\u00a026).\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That data, taken as a whole, is liable to allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data has been retained, such as everyday habits, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social relationships of those persons and the social environments frequented by them (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights judgment\n, paragraph\u00a027). In particular, that data provides the means, as observed by the Advocate General in points\u00a0253, 254 and 257 to 259 of his Opinion, of establishing a profile of the individuals concerned, information that is no less sensitive, having regard to the right to privacy, than the actual content of communications.\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The interference entailed by such legislation in the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter is very far-reaching and must be considered to be particularly serious. The fact that the data is retained without the subscriber or registered user being informed is likely to cause the persons concerned to feel that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraph\u00a037).\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if such legislation does not permit retention of the content of a communication and is not, therefore, such as to affect adversely the essence of those rights (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraph\u00a039), the retention of traffic and location data could nonetheless have an effect on the use of means of electronic communication and, consequently, on the exercise by the users thereof of their freedom of expression, guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights \njudgment, paragraph\u00a028). \n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the seriousness of the interference in the fundamental rights concerned represented by national legislation which, for the purpose of fighting crime, provides for the retention of traffic and location data, only the objective of fighting serious crime is capable of justifying such a measure (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraph\u00a060).\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, while the effectiveness of the fight against serious crime, in particular organised crime and terrorism, may depend to a great extent on the use of modern investigation techniques, such an objective of general interest, however fundamental it may be, cannot in itself justify that national legislation providing for the general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data should be considered to be necessary for the purposes of that fight (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraph\u00a051).\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be observed, first, that the effect of such legislation, in the light of its characteristic features as described in paragraph\u00a097 of the present judgment, is that the retention of traffic and location data is the rule, whereas the system put in place by Directive 2002/58 requires the retention of data to be the exception.\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which covers, in a generalised manner, all subscribers and registered users and all means of electronic communication as well as all traffic data, provides for no differentiation, limitation or exception according to the objective pursued. It is comprehensive in that it affects all persons using electronic communication services, even though those persons are not, even indirectly, in a situation that is liable to give rise to criminal proceedings. It therefore applies even to persons for whom there is no evidence capable of suggesting that their conduct might have a link, even an indirect or remote one, with serious criminal offences. Further, it does not provide for any exception, and consequently it applies even to persons whose communications are subject, according to rules of national law, to the obligation of professional secrecy (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraphs\u00a057 and 58).\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such legislation does not require there to be any relationship between the data which must be retained and a threat to public security. In particular, it is not restricted to retention in relation to (i) data pertaining to a particular time period and/or geographical area and/or a group of persons likely to be involved, in one way or another, in a serious crime, or (ii) persons who could, for other reasons, contribute, through their data being retained, to fighting crime (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraph\u00a059).\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings therefore exceeds the limits of what is strictly necessary and cannot be considered to be justified, within a democratic society, as required by Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter.\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, does not prevent a Member State from adopting legislation permitting, as a preventive measure, the targeted retention of traffic and location data, for the purpose of fighting serious crime, provided that the retention of data is limited, with respect to the categories of data to be retained, the means of communication affected, the persons concerned and the retention period adopted, to what is strictly necessary. \n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to satisfy the requirements set out in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment, that national legislation must, first, lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of such a data retention measure and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose data has been retained have sufficient guarantees of the effective protection of their personal data against the risk of misuse. That legislation must, in particular, indicate in what circumstances and under which conditions a data retention measure may, as a preventive measure, be adopted, thereby ensuring that such a measure is limited to what is strictly necessary (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraph\u00a054 and the case-law cited).\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as regards the substantive conditions which must be satisfied by national legislation that authorises, in the context of fighting crime, the retention, as a preventive measure, of traffic and location data, if it is to be ensured that data retention is limited to what is strictly necessary, it must be observed that, while those conditions may vary according to the nature of the measures taken for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, the retention of data must continue nonetheless to meet objective criteria, that establish a connection between the data to be retained and the objective pursued. In particular, such conditions must be shown to be such as actually to circumscribe, in practice, the extent of that measure and, thus, the public affected.\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regard the setting of limits on such a measure with respect to the public and the situations that may potentially be affected, the national legislation must be based on objective evidence which makes it possible to identify a public whose data is likely to reveal a link, at least an indirect one, with serious criminal offences, and to contribute in one way or another to fighting serious crime or to preventing a serious risk to public security. Such limits may be set by using a geographical criterion where the competent national authorities consider, on the basis of objective evidence, that there exists, in one or more geographical areas, a high risk of preparation for or commission of such offences.\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all of the foregoing, the answer to the first question referred in Case C-203/15 is that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which, for the purpose of fighting crime, provides for the general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data of all subscribers and registered users relating to all means of electronic communication.\n\u00a0\nThe second question in Case C-203/15 and the first question in Case C-698/15\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must, at the outset, be noted that the Kammarr\u00e4tten i Stockholm (Administrative Court of Appeal, Stockholm) referred the second question in Case C-203/15 only in the event that the answer to the first question in that case was negative. That second question, however, arises irrespective of whether retention of data is generalised or targeted, as set out in paragraphs\u00a0108 to 111 of this judgment. Accordingly, the Court must answer the second question in Case C-203/15 together with the first question in Case C-698/15, which is referred regardless of the extent of the obligation to retain data that is imposed on providers of electronic communications services.\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the second question in Case C-203/15 and the first question in Case C-698/15, the referring courts seek, in essence, to ascertain whether Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation governing the protection and security of traffic and location data, and more particularly, the access of the competent national authorities to retained data, where that legislation does not restrict that access solely to the objective of fighting serious crime, where that access is not subject to prior review by a court or an independent administrative authority, and where there is no requirement that the data concerned should be retained within the European Union.\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards objectives that are capable of justifying national legislation that derogates from the principle of confidentiality of electronic communications, it must be borne in mind that, since, as stated in paragraphs\u00a090 and 102 of this judgment, the list of objectives set out in the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 is exhaustive, access to the retained data must correspond, genuinely and strictly, to one of those objectives. Further, since the objective pursued by that legislation must be proportionate to the seriousness of the interference in fundamental rights that that access entails, it follows that, in the area of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, only the objective of fighting serious crime is capable of justifying such access to the retained data.\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards compatibility with the principle of proportionality, national legislation governing the conditions under which the providers of electronic communications services must grant the competent national authorities access to the retained data must ensure, in accordance with what was stated in paragraphs\u00a095 and 96 of this judgment, that such access does not exceed the limits of what is strictly necessary.\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, since the legislative measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 must, in accordance with recital 11 of that directive, \u2018be subject to adequate safeguards\u2019, a data retention measure must, as follows from the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a0109 of this judgment, lay down clear and precise rules indicating in what circumstances and under which conditions the providers of electronic communications services must grant the competent national authorities access to the data. Likewise, a measure of that kind must be legally binding under domestic law.\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure that access of the competent national authorities to retained data is limited to what is strictly necessary, it is, indeed, for national law to determine the conditions under which the providers of electronic communications services must grant such access. However, the national legislation concerned cannot be limited to requiring that access should be for one of the objectives referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, even if that objective is to fight serious crime. That national legislation must also lay down the substantive and procedural conditions governing the access of the competent national authorities to the retained data (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraph\u00a061).\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, and since general access to all retained data, regardless of whether there is any link, at least indirect, with the intended purpose, cannot be regarded as limited to what is strictly necessary, the national legislation concerned must be based on objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which the competent national authorities are to be granted access to the data of subscribers or registered users. In that regard, access can, as a general rule, be granted, in relation to the objective of fighting crime, only to the data of individuals suspected of planning, committing or having committed a serious crime or of being implicated in one way or another in such a crime (see, by analogy, ECtHR, 4\u00a0December 2015, \nZakharov v. Russia\n, CE:ECHR:2015:1204JUD004714306, \u00a7 260). However, in particular situations, where for example vital national security, defence or public security interests are threatened by terrorist activities, access to the data of other persons might also be granted where there is objective evidence from which it can be deduced that that data might, in a specific case, make an effective contribution to combating such activities.\n120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure, in practice, that those conditions are fully respected, it is essential that access of the competent national authorities to retained data should, as a general rule, except in cases of validly established urgency, be subject to a prior review carried out either by a court or by an independent administrative body, and that the decision of that court or body should be made following a reasoned request by those authorities submitted, inter alia, within the framework of procedures for the prevention, detection or prosecution of crime (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraph\u00a062; see also, by analogy, in relation to Article\u00a08 of the ECHR, ECtHR, 12\u00a0January 2016, \nSzab\u00f3 and Vissy v. Hungary\n, CE:ECHR:2016:0112JUD003713814, \u00a7\u00a7 77 and 80).\n121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, the competent national authorities to whom access to the retained data has been granted must notify the persons affected, under the applicable national procedures, as soon as that notification is no longer liable to jeopardise the investigations being undertaken by those authorities. That notification is, in fact, necessary to enable the persons affected to exercise, inter alia, their right to a legal remedy, expressly provided for in Article\u00a015(2) of Directive 2002/58, read together with Article\u00a022 of Directive 95/46, where their rights have been infringed (see, by analogy, judgments of 7\u00a0May 2009, \nRijkeboer\n, C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293, paragraph\u00a052, and of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph\u00a095).\n122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to the rules relating to the security and protection of data retained by providers of electronic communications services, it must be noted that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 does not allow Member States to derogate from Article\u00a04(1) and Article\u00a04(1a) of that directive. Those provisions require those providers to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the effective protection of retained data against risks of misuse and against any unlawful access to that data. Given the quantity of retained data, the sensitivity of that data and the risk of unlawful access to it, the providers of electronic communications services must, in order to ensure the full integrity and confidentiality of that data, guarantee a particularly high level of protection and security by means of appropriate technical and organisational measures. In particular, the national legislation must make provision for the data to be retained within the European Union and for the irreversible destruction of the data at the end of the data retention period (see, by analogy, in relation to Directive 2006/24, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraphs\u00a066 to 68).\n123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, the Member States must ensure review, by an independent authority, of compliance with the level of protection guaranteed by EU law with respect to the protection of individuals in relation to the processing of personal data, that control being expressly required by Article\u00a08(3) of the Charter and constituting, in accordance with the Court\u2019s settled case-law, an essential element of respect for the protection of individuals in relation to the processing of personal data. If that were not so, persons whose personal data was retained would be deprived of the right, guaranteed in Article\u00a08(1) and (3) of the Charter, to lodge with the national supervisory authorities a claim seeking the protection of their data (see, to that effect, the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, paragraph\u00a068, and the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2015, \nSchrems\n, C-362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraphs\u00a041 and 58).\n124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is the task of the referring courts to determine whether and to what extent the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings satisfies the requirements stemming from Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, as set out in paragraphs\u00a0115 to 123 of this judgment, with respect to both the access of the competent national authorities to the retained data and the protection and level of security of that data.\n125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all of the foregoing, the answer to the second question in Case C-203/15 and to the first question in Case C-698/15 is that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation governing the protection and security of traffic and location data and, in particular, access of the competent national authorities to the retained data, where the objective pursued by that access, in the context of fighting crime, is not restricted solely to fighting serious crime, where access is not subject to prior review by a court or an independent administrative authority, and where there is no requirement that the data concerned should be retained within the European Union.\n\u00a0\nThe second question in Case C-698/15\n126\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the second question in Case C-698/15, the Court of Appeal (England & Wales) (Civil Division) seeks in essence to ascertain whether, in the \nDigital Rights\n judgment, the Court interpreted Articles\u00a07 and/or 8 of the Charter in such a way as to expand the scope conferred on Article\u00a08 ECHR by the European Court of Human Rights.\n127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be recalled that, whilst, as Article\u00a06(3) TEU confirms, fundamental rights recognised by the ECHR constitute general principles of EU law, the ECHR does not constitute, as long as the European Union has not acceded to it, a legal instrument which has been formally incorporated into EU law (see, to that effect, judgment of 15\u00a0February 2016, \nN.\n, C-601/15 PPU, EU:C:2016:84, paragraph\u00a045 and the case-law cited).\n128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the interpretation of Directive 2002/58, which is at issue in this case, must be undertaken solely in the light of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 15\u00a0February 2016, \nN.\n, C-601/15 PPU, EU:C:2016:84, paragraph\u00a046 and the case-law cited).\n129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, it must be borne in mind that the explanation on Article\u00a052 of the Charter indicates that paragraph\u00a03 of that article is intended to ensure the necessary consistency between the Charter and the ECHR, \u2018without thereby adversely affecting the autonomy of Union law and \u2026 that of the Court of Justice of the European Union\u2019 (judgment of 15\u00a0February 2016, \nN.\n, C-601/15 PPU, EU:C:2016:84, paragraph\u00a047). In particular, as expressly stated in the second sentence of Article\u00a052(3) of the Charter, the first sentence of Article\u00a052(3) does not preclude Union law from providing protection that is more extensive then the ECHR.\u00a0It should be added, finally, that Article\u00a08 of the Charter concerns a fundamental right which is distinct from that enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter and which has no equivalent in the ECHR.\n130\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in accordance with the Court\u2019s settled case-law, the justification for making a request for a preliminary ruling is not for advisory opinions to be delivered on general or hypothetical questions, but rather that it is necessary for the effective resolution of a dispute concerning EU law (see, to that effect, judgments of 24\u00a0April 2012, \nKamberaj\n, C-571/10, EU:C:2012:233, paragraph\u00a041; of 26\u00a0February 2013, \n\u00c5kerberg Fransson\n, C-617/10, EU:C:2013:105, paragraph\u00a042, and of 27\u00a0February 2014, \nPohotovos\u0165\n, C-470/12, EU:C:2014:101 paragraph\u00a029).\n131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, in view of the considerations set out, in particular, in paragraphs\u00a0128 and 129 of the present judgment, the question whether the protection conferred by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter is wider than that guaranteed in Article\u00a08 of the ECHR is not such as to affect the interpretation of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of the Charter, which is the matter in dispute in the proceedings in Case C-698/15.\n132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it does not appear that an answer to the second question in Case C-698/15 can provide any interpretation of points of EU law that is required for the resolution, in the light of that law, of that dispute.\n133\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the second question in Case C-698/15 is inadmissible.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n134\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the actions pending before the national courts, the decision on costs is a matter for those courts. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which, for the purpose of fighting crime, provides for general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data of all subscribers and registered users relating to all means of electronic communication.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, as amended by Directive 2009/136, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation governing the protection and security of traffic and location data and, in particular, access of the competent national authorities to the retained data, where the objective pursued by that access, in the context of fighting crime, is not restricted solely to fighting serious crime, where access is not subject to prior review by a court or an independent administrative authority, and where there is no requirement that the data concerned should be retained within the European Union.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe second question referred by the Court of Appeal (England & Wales) (Civil Division) is inadmissible.\nLenaerts \nTizzano\nSilva de Lapuerta\nvon Danwitz \nDa Cruz Vila\u00e7a \nJuh\u00e1sz\nVilaras \nBorg Barthet\nMalenovsk\u00fd\nLevits\nBonichot\nArabadjiev\nRodin\nBiltgen \nLycourgos\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 21 December 2016.\nA.

LH performed the duties of \u2018head of legal affairs\u2019 within that company from 15\u00a0January 2018 and those of data protection officer from 1\u00a0February 2018.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 13\u00a0July 2018, Leistritz terminated LH\u2019s employment contract with notice, with effect from 15\u00a0August 2018, invoking a restructuring measure of that company, in the context of which the activity of internal legal adviser and the data protection service were to be outsourced.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The courts adjudicating on the substance, before which LH challenged the validity of the termination of her contract, ruled that that termination was invalid, since, in accordance with the combined provisions of Paragraph\u00a038(2) and the second sentence of Paragraph\u00a06(4) of the BDSG, LH\u2019s contract could be terminated extraordinarily only if there was just cause, owing to her status as data protection officer. The restructuring measure described by Leistritz did not, they found, constitute such a cause.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court, before which Leistritz has brought an appeal on a point of law (\u2018\nRevision\n\u2019), observes that, under German law, the termination of LH\u2019s contract is void pursuant to those provisions and Paragraph\u00a0134 of the Civil Code. Nonetheless, it points out that the applicability of Paragraph\u00a038(2) and of the second sentence of Paragraph\u00a06(4) of the BDSG depends on whether EU law, and in particular the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR, allows legislation of a Member State to make the termination of a data protection officer\u2019s employment contract subject to stricter conditions than those provided for by EU law. If it does not, the referring court would have to uphold the appeal on a point of law.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states that its doubts arise particularly from the existence of a divergence in the national legal literature. On the one hand, the majority view considers that the special protection against termination provided for by the combined provisions of Paragraph\u00a038(2) and the second sentence of Paragraph\u00a06(4) of the BDSG constitutes a substantive rule of employment law in respect of which the European Union does not have legislative competence, with the result that those provisions are not contrary to the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR. On the other hand, according to the proponents of the minority view, the links between that protection and the position of data protection officer conflict with EU law and give rise to economic pressure to retain a data protection officer on a long-term basis once he or she has been designated.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Bundesarbeitsgericht (Federal Labour Court, Germany) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of [the GDPR] to be interpreted as precluding a provision in national law, such as Paragraph\u00a038(1) and (2) in conjunction with the second sentence of Paragraph\u00a06(4) of the [BDSG], which declares ordinary termination of the employment contract of the data protection officer by the data controller, who is his or her employer, to be impermissible, irrespective of whether his or her contract is terminated for performing his or her tasks?\nIf the first question is answered in the affirmative:\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR also preclude such a provision in national law if the designation of the data protection officer is not mandatory in accordance with Article\u00a037(1) of the GDPR, but is mandatory only in accordance with the law of the Member State?\nIf the first question is answered in the affirmative:\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR based on a sufficient enabling clause, in particular in so far as this covers data protection officers that are party to an employment contract with the data controller?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides that a controller or a processor may terminate the employment contract of a data protection officer, who is a member of his or her staff, only with just cause, even if the contractual termination is not related to the performance of that officer\u2019s tasks.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is clear from settled case-law, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary to consider not only its wording, by considering the latter\u2019s usual meaning in everyday language, but also the context in which the provision occurs and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part (judgment of 22\u00a0February 2022\n, Stichting Rookpreventie Jeugd and Others\n, C-160/20, EU:C:2022:101, paragraph\u00a029 and the case-law cited).\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, as regards the wording of the provision at issue, it should be noted that Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR provides, in its second sentence, that \u2018he or she shall not be dismissed or penalised by the controller or the processor for performing his [or her] tasks\u2019.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset, it should be noted that the GDPR does not define the terms \u2018dismissed\u2019, \u2018penalised\u2019 and \u2018for performing his [or her] tasks\u2019 featuring in the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3).\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, first, in accordance with the meaning which those words have in everyday language, the prohibition of the dismissal, by a controller or processor, of a data protection officer or of the imposition, by a controller or processor, of a penalty on him or her means, as the Advocate General essentially observed in points\u00a024 and 26 of his Opinion, that that officer must be protected against any decision terminating his or her duties, by which he or she would be placed at a disadvantage or which would constitute a penalty.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, a measure terminating a data protection officer\u2019s employment contract taken by his or her employer and terminating the employment relationship existing between that officer and that employer and, therefore, also terminating the function of data protection officer in the undertaking concerned may constitute such a decision.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR clearly applies without distinction both to the data protection officer who is a member of the staff of the controller or processor and to the person who fulfils the tasks on the basis of a service contract concluded with the latter, in accordance with Article\u00a037(6) of the GDPR.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR is intended to apply to the relationship between a data protection officer and a controller or processor, irrespective of the nature of the employment relationship between that controller and the latter.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, it should be noted that that provision imposes a limit which consists, as the Advocate General stated, in essence, in point\u00a029 of his Opinion, in prohibiting the termination of a data protection officer\u2019s employment contract on a ground relating to the performance of his or her tasks, which include, in particular, under Article\u00a039(1)(b) of the GDPR, monitoring compliance with EU or Member State legal provisions and with the policies of the controller or processor in relation to the protection of personal data.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards the objective pursued by the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR, it must first be pointed out that recital\u00a097 of that regulation states that data protection officers, whether or not they are employees of the controller, should be in a position to perform their duties and tasks in an independent manner. In that regard, such independence must necessarily enable them to carry out those tasks in accordance with the objective of the GDPR, which seeks, inter alia, as is apparent from recital\u00a010 thereof, to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union and, to that end, to ensure a consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of such natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0207 and the case-law cited).\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the objective of ensuring the functional independence of the data protection officer, as it follows from the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR, is also apparent from the first and third sentences of that provision, which require that that officer is not to receive any instructions regarding the exercise of those tasks and is to report directly to the highest level of management of the controller or processor, and from Article\u00a038(5), which provides that, with regard to that exercise, that officer is to be bound by secrecy or confidentiality.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR, by protecting the data protection officer against any decision which terminates his or her duties, places him or her at a disadvantage or constitutes a penalty, where such a decision relates to the performance of his or her tasks, must be regarded as essentially seeking to preserve the functional independence of the data protection officer and, therefore, to ensure that the provisions of the GDPR are effective. By contrast, that provision is not intended to govern the overall employment relationship between a controller or a processor and staff members who are likely to be affected only incidentally, to the extent strictly necessary for the achievement of those objectives.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is supported, in the third place, by the context of that provision and, in particular, by the legal basis on which the EU legislature adopted the GDPR.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from the preamble to the GDPR, that regulation was adopted on the basis of Article\u00a016 TFEU, paragraph\u00a02 of which provides, in particular, that the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union are, by means of regulations, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, to lay down the rules relating, first, to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of EU law and, second, to the free movement of such data.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, apart from the specific protection of the data protection officer provided for in the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR, the fixing of rules on protection against the termination of the employment contract of a data protection officer employed by a controller or by a processor does not fall within the scope of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data or within the scope of the free movement of such data, but within the field of social policy.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind, first, that, under Article\u00a04(2)(b) TFEU, the European Union and the Member States have, in the field of social policy, for the aspects defined in that Treaty, a shared competence for the purposes of Article\u00a02(2) thereof. Second, and as is specified in Article\u00a0153(1)(d) TFEU, the European Union is to support and complement the activities of the Member States in the field of the protection of workers in cases where their employment contract is terminated (see, by analogy judgment of 19\u00a0November 2019, \nTSN and AKT\n, C-609/17 and C-610/17, EU:C:2019:981, paragraph\u00a047).\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, as is clear from Article\u00a0153(2)(b) TFEU, it is by means of directives that the Parliament and the Council may lay down minimum requirements in that regard, since such minimum requirements cannot, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, in the light of Article\u00a0153(4) TFEU, prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures that are compatible with the Treaties (see, to that effect judgment of 19\u00a0November 2019, \nTSN and AKT\n, C-609/17 and C-610/17, EU:C:2019:981, paragraph\u00a048).\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows, as the Advocate General stated, in essence, in point\u00a044 of his Opinion, that each Member State is free, in the exercise of its retained competence, to lay down more protective specific provisions on the termination of a data protection officer\u2019s employment contract, in so far as those provisions are compatible with EU law and, in particular, with the provisions of the GDPR, particularly the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) thereof.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, as the Advocate General observed in points\u00a050 and 51 of his Opinion, such increased protection cannot undermine the achievement of the objectives of the GDPR. That would be the case if it prevented any termination of the employment contract, by a controller or by a processor, of a data protection officer who no longer possesses the professional qualities required to perform his or her tasks or who does not fulfil those tasks in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which provides that a controller or a processor may terminate the employment contract of a data protection officer, who is a member of his or her staff, only with just cause, even if the contractual termination is not related to the performance of that officer\u2019s tasks, in so far as such legislation does not undermine the achievement of the objectives of the GDPR.\n\u00a0\nThe second and third questions\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the answer given to the first question, there is no need to answer the second and third questions.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\nThe second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which provides that a controller or a processor may terminate the employment contract of a data protection officer, who is a member of his or her staff, only with just cause, even if the contractual termination is not related to the performance of that officer\u2019s tasks, in so far as such legislation does not undermine the achievement of the objectives of that regulation."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right;\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the [European] Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States.\u00a0\u2026\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data,\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communication relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(58)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example, when addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether, by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collected, such as in the case of online advertising. Given that children merit specific protection, any information and communication, where processing is addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily understand.\n\u2026\n(60)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(63)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A data subject should have the right of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her, and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing.\u00a0\u2026 Every data subject should therefore have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the logic involved in any automatic personal data processing and, at least when based on profiling, the consequences of such processing.\u00a0\u2026 That right should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting the software.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(74)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The responsibility and liability of the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on the controller\u2019s behalf should be established. In particular, the controller should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.\u2019\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01 of the GDPR, headed \u2018Subject matter and objectives\u2019, provides in paragraph\u00a02 thereof:\n\u2018This

and the outcome of the complaint including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Article\u00a078.\u2019\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a079 of the GDPR, entitled \u2018Right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor\u2019, states in paragraph\u00a01 thereof:\n\u2018Without prejudice to any available administrative or non-judicial remedy, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority pursuant to Article\u00a077, each data subject shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy where he or she considers that his or her rights under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of his or her personal data in non-compliance with this Regulation.\u2019\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a082 of that regulation, entitled \u2018Right to compensation and liability\u2019, provides in paragraph\u00a01 thereof:\n\u2018Any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered.\u2019\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a099(2) thereof, the GDPR has been applicable from 25\u00a0May 2018.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2014, J.M., who was then an employee and customer of Pankki S, learned that his own customer data had been accessed by members of the bank\u2019s staff on several occasions during the period from 1\u00a0November to 31\u00a0December 2013.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since he had doubts as to the lawfulness of those consultations, J.M., who had in the meantime been dismissed from his post with Pankki S, on 29\u00a0May 2018 asked Pankki S to inform him of the identity of the persons who had consulted his customer data, the exact dates of the consultations and the purposes for which those data were processed.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its reply of 30\u00a0August 2018, Pankki S, in its capacity as controller within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of the GDPR, refused to disclose the identity of the employees who had carried out the consultation operations on the ground that that information constituted the personal data of those employees.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in that reply, Pankki S provided further details of the consultation operations carried out, on its instructions, by its internal audit department. It thus explained that a customer of the bank in respect of whom J.M. was the customer advisor was a creditor of a person also bearing J.M.\u2019s surname, so that the bank had wished to clarify whether the applicant in the main proceedings and the debtor in question were one and the same person and whether there might have been a possible impermissible conflict of interest. Pankki S added that the clarification of that issue required the processing of J.M.\u2019s data, and every member of the bank\u2019s staff who had processed his data had given a statement to the internal audit department on the reasons for the processing of the data. In addition, the bank stated that those consultations had made it possible to rule out any suspicion of conflict of interest in relation to J.M..\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0J.M. applied to the Tietosuojavaltuutetun toimisto (Data Protection Supervisor\u2019s Office, Finland), the supervisory authority within the meaning of Article\u00a04(21) of the GDPR, for an order that Pankki S provide him with the information requested.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 4\u00a0August 2020, the Assistant Data Protection Supervisor rejected J.M.\u2019s application. He explained that such an application sought to enable J.M. to gain access to the log data of the employees who had processed his data, whereas, under the Assistant Data Protection Supervisor\u2019s decision-making practice, such log data constituted personal data relating not to the person concerned but to the employees who processed the data of that person.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0J.M. brought an action against that decision before the referring court.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court notes that Article\u00a015 of the GDPR provides for the right of the data subject to obtain from the controller access to the data processed concerning him or her and information relating, inter alia, to the purposes of the processing and recipients of the data. It asks whether the communication of the log data generated during processing operations, which contain such information, in particular the identity of the controller\u2019s employees, is covered by Article\u00a015 of the GDPR, since those log data might prove necessary to the data subject for the purposes of assessing the lawfulness of the processing of his or her data.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the It\u00e4-Suomen hallinto-oikeus (Administrative Court of Eastern Finland) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the data subject\u2019s right of access under Article\u00a015(1) of the [GDPR], considered in conjunction with the [concept of] \u201cpersonal data\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) thereof, to be interpreted as meaning that information collected by the controller, which indicates who processed the data subject\u2019s personal data and when and for what purpose they were processed, does not constitute information in respect of which the data subject has a right of access, in particular because it consists of data concerning the controller\u2019s employees?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question 1 is answered in the affirmative and the data subject does not have a right of access to the information referred to in that question on the basis of Article\u00a015(1) of the [GDPR], because it does not constitute \u201cpersonal data\u201d of the data subject within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of [that regulation], it remains necessary in the present case to consider the information in respect of which the data subject does have a right of access in accordance with Article\u00a015(1)[(a) to (h)]:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How is the purpose of processing within the meaning of Article\u00a015(1)(a) [of the GDPR] to be interpreted in relation to the scope of the data subject\u2019s right of access, that is to say, can the purpose of the processing give rise to a right of access to the user log data collected by the controller, such as information concerning personal data of the processors and the time and the purpose of the processing of the personal data?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, can the persons who processed J.M.\u2019s customer data be regarded, under certain criteria, as recipients of the personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a015(1)(c) of the [GDPR], in respect of whom the data subject would be entitled to obtain information?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the fact that the bank at issue performs a regulated activity or that J.M. was both an employee and a customer of the bank at the same time relevant to the present case?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the fact that J.M.\u2019s data were processed before the entry into force of the [GDPR] relevant to the examination of the questions set out above?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe fourth question\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, which it is appropriate to examine first, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a015 of the GDPR, read in the light of Article\u00a099(2) of that regulation, is applicable to a request for access to the information referred to in the first of those provisions where the processing operations covered by that request were carried out before the date on which that regulation became applicable, but the request was made after that date.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer that question, it should be noted that, under Article\u00a099(2) of the GDPR, that regulation has been applicable since 25\u00a0May 2018.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that the personal data processing operations at issue in the main proceedings were carried out between 1\u00a0November 2013 and 31\u00a0December 2013, that is to say, before the date on which the GDPR became applicable. However, it is also apparent from that decision that J.M. submitted his request for information to Pankki S after that date, namely on 29\u00a0May 2018.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be borne in mind that procedural rules are generally taken to apply from the date on which they enter into force, as opposed to substantive rules, which are usually interpreted as applying to situations that have arisen and become definitive before their entry into force only in so far as it follows clearly from their terms, their objectives or their general scheme that such an effect must be given to them (judgment of 15\u00a0June 2021, \nFacebook Ireland and Others\n, C-645/19, EU:C:2021:483, paragraph\u00a0100 and the case-law cited).\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that J.M.\u2019s request to be provided with the information at issue in the main proceedings is connected with Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR, which provides for the right of the data subject to obtain access to personal data concerning him or her which are being processed, and to the information referred to in that provision.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be stated that that provision does not concern the conditions under which the processing of the personal data of the data subject is lawful. Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR merely specifies the scope of that data subject\u2019s right of access to the data and to the information to which it covers.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a033 of his Opinion, that Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR confers on data subjects a procedural right consisting of obtaining information about the processing of their personal data. As a procedural rule, that provision applies to requests for access made from the entry into application of that regulation, such as J.M.\u2019s request.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the answer to the fourth question is that Article\u00a015 of the GDPR, read in the light of Article\u00a099(2) of that regulation, must be interpreted as meaning that it is applicable to a request for access to the information referred to in that provision where the processing operations which that request concerns were carried out before the date on which that regulation became applicable, but the request was submitted after that date.\n\u00a0\nThe first and second questions\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first and second questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that information relating to consultation operations carried out on a data subject\u2019s personal data and concerning the dates and purposes of those operations, and the identity of the natural persons who carried out those operations, constitutes information which that data subject is entitled to obtain from the controller under that provision.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with settled case-law, the interpretation of a provision of EU law requires that account be taken not only of its wording, but also of its context and the objectives and purpose pursued by the act of which it forms part (judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Information regarding the recipients of personal data)\n, C-154/21, EU:C:2023:3, point\u00a029).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, first of all, the wording of Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR, that provision states that the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and information about the purposes of the processing and the recipients or categories of recipient to whom those personal data have been or will be disclosed.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be pointed out that the concepts in Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR are defined in Article\u00a04 of that regulation.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in the first place, Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR states that personal data is \u2018any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019 and specifies that \u2018an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person\u2019.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use of the expression \u2018any information\u2019 in the definition of the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 in that provision reflects the aim of the EU legislature to assign a wide scope to that concept, which potentially encompasses all kinds of information, not only objective but also subjective, in the form of opinions and assessments, provided that it \u2018relates\u2019 to the data subject (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a023).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it has been held that information relates to an identified or identifiable natural person where, by reason of its content, purpose or effect, it is linked to an identifiable person (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a024).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the \u2018identifiable\u2019 nature of a person, recital\u00a026 of the GDPR states that account should be taken of \u2018all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly\u2019.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the broad definition of the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 covers not only data collected and stored by the controller, but also includes all information resulting from the processing of personal data relating to an identified or identifiable person (see, to that effect, judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a026).\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards the concept of \u2018processing\u2019, as defined in Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR, it should be noted that, by using the expression \u2018any operation\u2019, the EU legislature intended to give that concept a broad scope by using a non-exhaustive list of operations applied to personal data or sets of personal data, which cover, among others, collection, recording, storage or also consultation (see, to that effect, judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a027).\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, Article\u00a04(9) of the GDPR states that \u2018recipient\u2019 means \u2018a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not\u2019.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court has held that the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller information about the specific recipients to whom the personal data concerning him or her have been or will be disclosed (judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Information regarding the recipients of personal data)\n, C-154/21, EU:C:2023:3, paragraph\u00a046).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it follows from the textual analysis of Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR and the concepts contained therein that the right of access granted to the data subject by that provision is characterised by the broad scope of the information that the controller must provide to the data subject.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, next, the context of Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR, in the first place, recital\u00a063 of that regulation provides that every data subject should have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the personal data are processed and the recipients of the personal data.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, recital\u00a060 of the GDPR states that the principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes, it being stressed that the controller should provide any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed. Furthermore, in accordance with the principle of transparency, alluded to by the referring court, to which recital\u00a058 of the GDPR refers and which is expressly enshrined in Article\u00a012(1) of that regulation, any information sent to the data subject must be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and formulated in clear and plain language.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Article\u00a012(1) of the GDPR states that the information must be provided by the controller in writing or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means, unless the data subject requests that it be provided orally. The purpose of that provision, an expression of the principle of transparency, is to ensure that the data subject is able fully to understand the information sent to him or her (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a038 and the case-law cited).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing contextual analysis that Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR is one of the provisions intended to ensure the transparency of the manner in which personal data are processed in relation to the data subject.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, that interpretation of the scope of the right of access provided for in Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR is supported by the objectives pursued by that regulation.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, as stated in recitals\u00a010 and 11 thereof, the purpose of that regulation is to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union and to strengthen and set out in detail the rights of data subjects.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, as is apparent from recital\u00a063 of the GDPR, the right of a data subject to have access to his or her own personal data and to the other information referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of that regulation is intended, first of all, to enable that person to become aware of the processing and to verify its lawfulness. It follows, according to that same recital and as stated in paragraph\u00a050 above, that every data subject should have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data and the logic involved in their processing.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be recalled, secondly, that the Court has already held that the right of access provided for in Article\u00a015 of the GDPR must enable the data subject to ensure that the personal data relating to him or her are correct and that they are processed in a lawful manner (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF, \n C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a034).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, that right of access is necessary to enable the data subject to exercise, depending on the circumstances, his or her right to rectification, right to erasure (\u2018right to be forgotten\u2019) or right to restriction of processing, conferred, respectively, by Articles\u00a016 to 18 of the GDPR, as well as the data subject\u2019s right to object to his or her personal data being processed, laid down in Article\u00a021 of the GDPR, and right of action where he or she suffers damage, laid down in Articles\u00a079 and 82 of the GDPR (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a035 and the case-law cited).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR is one of the provisions intended to ensure transparency vis-\u00e0-vis the data subject of the manner in which personal data are processed (judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Information regarding the recipients of personal data)\n, C-154/21, EU:C:2023:3, paragraph\u00a042), without which that data subject would not be in a position to assess the lawfulness of the processing of his or her data or to exercise the rights provided for, inter alia, in Articles\u00a016 to 18, 21, 79 and 82 of that regulation.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that J.M. requested Pankki S to provide him with information relating to the consultation operations carried out on his personal data between 1\u00a0November 2013 and 31\u00a0December 2013, including the dates of those consultations, their purposes and the identity of the persons who carried them out. The referring court states that the transmission of the log data generated during those operations would make it possible to respond to J.M\u2019s request.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, it is not disputed that the consultation operations carried out on the personal data of the applicant in the main proceedings constitute \u2018processing\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR, with the result that they confer on him, pursuant to Article\u00a015(1) of that regulation, not only a right of access to those personal data, but also a right to be provided with the information linked to those operations, as referred to in the latter provision.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In respect of information such as that requested by J.M., the communication, first of all, of the dates of the consultation operations is such as to enable the data subject to obtain confirmation that his personal data have actually been processed at a given time. In addition, since the conditions of lawfulness laid down in Articles\u00a05 and 6 of the GDPR must be satisfied at the point of the processing itself, the date of that processing is a factor which makes it possible to verify its lawfulness. Next, it should be noted that information relating to the purposes of the processing is expressly referred to in Article\u00a015(1)(a) of that regulation. Lastly, Article\u00a015(1)(c) of that regulation provides that the controller is to inform the data subject of the recipients to whom his or her data have been disclosed.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, specifically, the communication of all that information by means of the provision of the log data relating to the processing operations at issue in the main proceedings, it should be noted that the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR states that the controller \u2018shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing\u2019.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court has already held that the concept of \u2018copy\u2019 thus used refers to the faithful reproduction or transcription of an original, with the result that a purely general description of the data undergoing processing or a reference to categories of personal data does not correspond to that definition. Furthermore, it is apparent from the wording of the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of that regulation that the disclosure obligation relates to the personal data undergoing the processing in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a021).\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The copy that the controller is required to provide must contain all the personal data undergoing processing, must have all the characteristics necessary for the data subject effectively to exercise his or her rights under that regulation and must, consequently, reproduce those data fully and faithfully (see, to that effect, judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraphs\u00a032 and 39).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure that the information thus provided is easy to understand, as required by Article\u00a012(1) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with recital\u00a058 of that regulation, the reproduction of extracts from documents or even entire documents or extracts from databases which contain, inter alia, the personal data undergoing processing may prove to be essential where the contextualisation of the data processed is necessary in order to ensure the data are intelligible. In particular, where personal data are generated from other data or where such data result from empty fields, that is to say, where there is an absence of information which provides information about the data subject, the context in which the data are processed is an essential element in enabling the data subject to have transparent access and an intelligible presentation of those data (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023,\n \u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraphs\u00a041 and 42).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, as the Advocate General observed in points\u00a088 to 90 of his Opinion, the log data, which contain the information requested by J.M., correspond to records of activities, within the meaning of Article\u00a030 of the GDPR. It must be held that they fall within the scope of the measures, referred to in recital\u00a074 of that regulation, implemented by the controller to demonstrate the compliance of the processing activities with that regulation. Article\u00a030(4) of that regulation specifies in particular that they must be made available to the supervisory authority on its request.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as those records of activities do not contain information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person within the meaning of the case-law referred to in paragraphs\u00a042 and 43 above, they merely enable the controller to fulfil his or her obligations towards the supervisory authority which requests the provision of those records.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, more specifically, the controller\u2019s log data, the disclosure of a copy of the information contained in those files may be necessary in order to satisfy the obligation to provide the data subject with access to all the information referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR and to ensure fair and transparent processing, thus enabling him or her fully to assert his or her rights under that regulation.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, such log data reveal the existence of data processing, information to which the data subject must have access under Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR. In addition, they provide information on the frequency and intensity of the consultation operations, thus enabling the data subject to ensure that the processing carried out is actually motivated by the purposes put forward by the controller.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, those files contain information relating to the identity of the persons who carried out the consultation operations.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that the persons who carried out the consultation operations at issue in the main proceedings are employees of Pankki S, who acted under its authority and in accordance with its instructions.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although it follows from Article\u00a015(1)(c) of the GDPR that the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller information relating to the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, the employees of the controller cannot be regarded as being \u2018recipients\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a015(1)(c) of the GDPR, as recalled in paragraphs\u00a047 and 48 above, when they process personal data under the authority of that controller and in accordance with its instructions, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a063 of his Opinion.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be pointed out that, in accordance with Article\u00a029 of the GDPR, any person acting under the authority of the controller who has access to personal data may process those data only on instructions from that controller.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being the case, the information contained in the log data relating to the persons who have consulted the data subject\u2019s personal data could constitute information falling within the scope of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR, as recalled in paragraph\u00a041 above, capable of enabling him or her to verify the lawfulness of the processing of his or her data and, in particular, to satisfy him or herself that the processing operations were actually carried out under the authority of the controller and in accordance with its instructions.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, first, it is apparent from the order for reference that the information in log data such as those at issue in the main proceedings makes it possible to identify the employees who carried out the processing operations and contains personal data of those employees, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of the GDPR.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that, as regards the right of access provided for in Article\u00a015 of the GDPR, recital\u00a063 of that regulation states that \u2018that right should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others\u2019.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under recital\u00a04 of the GDPR, the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right, since it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0172).\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if the disclosure of the information relating to the identity of the controller\u2019s employees to the data subject may be necessary for that data subject in order to ensure the lawfulness of the processing of his or her personal data, it is nevertheless liable to infringe the rights and freedoms of those employees.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, in the event of a conflict between, on the one hand, the exercise of a right of access which ensures the effectiveness of the rights conferred on the data subject by the GDPR and, on the other hand, the rights or freedoms of others, a balance will have to be struck between the rights and freedoms in question. Wherever possible, means of communicating personal data that do not infringe the rights or freedoms of others should be chosen, bearing in mind that, as follows from recital\u00a063 of the GDPR, \u2018the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject\u2019 (see, to that effect, judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a044).\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, secondly, it is apparent from the order for reference that J.M. does not seek disclosure of the information relating to the identity of Pankki S\u2019s employees who carried out the consultation operations on his personal data on the ground that they did not actually act under the authority and in accordance with the instructions of the controller, but appears to doubt the veracity of the information relating to the purpose of those consultations communicated to him by Pankki S.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In such circumstances, if the data subject were to consider the information provided by the controller to be insufficient to enable him or her to dispel his or her doubts as to the lawfulness of the processing of his or her personal data, he or she has the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority on the basis of Article\u00a077(1) of the GDPR, that authority having the power, under Article\u00a058(1)(a) of that regulation, to request the controller to provide it with any information it needs in order to examine the data subject\u2019s complaint.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing considerations that Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that information relating to consultation operations carried out on a data subject\u2019s personal data and concerning the dates and purposes of those operations constitutes information which that person has the right to obtain from the controller under that provision. On the other hand, that provision does not lay down such a right in respect of information relating to the identity of the employees of that controller who carried out those operations under its authority and in accordance with its instructions, unless that information is essential in order to enable the data subject effectively to exercise the rights conferred on him or her by that regulation and provided that the rights and freedoms of those employees are taken into account.\n\u00a0\nThe third question\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the fact, first, that the controller is engaged in the business of banking and acts within the framework of a regulated activity and, second, that the data subject whose personal data has been processed in his or her capacity as a customer of the controller was also an employee of that controller is relevant for the purposes of defining the scope of the right of access conferred on him or her by Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset, it should be noted that, as regards the scope of the right of access provided for in Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR, no provision of that regulation draws a distinction according to the nature of the activities of the controller or the status of the person whose personal data are being processed.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, first, the regulated nature of Pankki S\u2019s activity, it is true that Article\u00a023 of the GDPR allows Member States to restrict by way of a legislative measure the scope of the obligations and rights provided for, inter alia, in Article\u00a015 of that regulation.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it is not apparent from the order for reference that Pankki S\u2019s activity is subject to such legislation.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, secondly, the fact that J.M. was both a customer and an employee of Pankki S, it should be noted that, having regard not only to the objectives of the GDPR but also to the scope of the data subject\u2019s right of access, as recalled in paragraphs\u00a049 and 55 to 59 above, the context in which that data subject requests access to the information referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR cannot have any influence on the scope of that right.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that the controller is engaged in the business of banking and acts within the framework of a regulated activity and that the data subject whose personal data has been processed in his or her capacity as a customer of the controller was also an employee of that controller, in principle, has no effect on the scope of the right of access conferred on that data subject by that provision.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a015 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), read in the light of Article\u00a099(2) of that regulation,\nmust be interpreted as meaning that it is applicable to a request for access to the information referred to in that provision where the processing operations which that request concerns were carried out before the date on which that regulation became applicable, but the request was submitted after that date.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a015(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that information relating to consultation operations carried out on a data subject\u2019s personal data and concerning the dates and purposes of those operations constitutes information which that person has the right to obtain from the controller under that provision. On the other hand, that provision does not lay down such a right in respect of information relating to the identity of the employees of that controller who carried out those operations under its authority and in accordance with its instructions, unless that information is essential in order to enable the person concerned effectively to exercise the rights conferred on him or her by that regulation and provided that the rights and freedoms of those employees are taken into account.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a015(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the fact that the controller is engaged in the business of banking and acts within the framework of a regulated activity and that the data subject whose personal data has been processed in his or her capacity as a customer of the controller was also an employee of that controller has, in principle, no effect on the scope of the right of access conferred on that data subject by that provision."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 20 Sep 2022, C-339/20 (\nVD\n)\nCharter of fundamental rights of the EU \n >

(h) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16\u00a0April 2014 on market abuse (market abuse regulation) and repealing Directive 2003/6/EC and Commission Directives 2003/124/EC, 2003/125/EC and 2004/72/EC (OJ 2014 L\u00a0173, p.\u00a01), read in conjunction with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ 2002 L\u00a0201, p.\u00a037), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009 (OJ 2009 L\u00a0337, p.\u00a011) (\u2018Directive 2002/58\u2019), and read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019).\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The requests have been made in the context of criminal proceedings brought against VD and SR in respect of insider dealing, concealment of insider dealing, aiding and abetting, corruption and money laundering.\n\u00a0\nLegal context\n\u00a0\nEuropean Union law\n\u00a0\nDirective 2002/58\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a02, 6, 7 and 11 of Directive 2002/58 state:\n\u2018(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive seeks to respect the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the [Charter]. In particular, this Directive seeks to ensure full respect for the rights set out in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of that Charter.\n\u2026\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Internet is overturning traditional market structures by providing a common, global infrastructure for the delivery of a wide range of electronic communications services. Publicly available electronic communications services over the Internet open new possibilities for users but also new risks for their personal data and privacy.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case of public communications networks, specific legal, regulatory and technical provisions should be made in order to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and legitimate interests of legal persons, in particular with regard to the increasing capacity for automated storage and processing of data relating to subscribers and users.\n\u2026\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like Directive [95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L\u00a0281, p.\u00a031)], this Directive does not address issues of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms related to activities which are not governed by Community law. Therefore it does not alter the existing balance between the individual\u2019s right to privacy and the possibility for Member States to take the measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of this Directive, necessary for the protection of public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the activities relate to State security matters) and the enforcement of criminal law. Consequently, this Directive does not affect the ability of Member States to carry out lawful interception of electronic communications, or take other measures, if necessary for any of these purposes and in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms[, signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950], as interpreted by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights. Such measures must be appropriate, strictly proportionate to the intended purpose and necessary within a democratic society and should be subject to adequate safeguards in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\u2019\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01 of Directive 2002/58, headed \u2018Scope and aim\u2019, provides:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive provides for the harmonisation of the national provisions required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy and confidentiality, with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic communication sector and to ensure the free movement of such data and of electronic communication equipment and services in the Community.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provisions of this Directive particularise and complement Directive [95/46] for the purposes mentioned in paragraph\u00a01.

In particular, they shall prohibit listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communications and the related traffic data by persons other than users, without the consent of the users concerned, except when legally authorised to do so in accordance with Article\u00a015(1). This paragraph shall not prevent technical storage which is necessary for the conveyance of a communication without prejudice to the principle of confidentiality.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph\u00a01 shall not affect any legally authorised recording of communications and the related traffic data when carried out in the course of lawful business practice for the purpose of providing evidence of a commercial transaction or of any other business communication.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information, in accordance with Directive [95/46], inter alia, about the purposes of the processing. This shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly necessary in order for the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide the service.\u2019\n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06 of Directive 2002/58, headed \u2018Traffic data\u2019, provides:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Traffic data relating to subscribers and users processed and stored by the provider of a public communications network or publicly available electronic communications service must be erased or made anonymous when it is no longer needed for the purpose of the transmission of a communication without prejudice to paragraphs\u00a02, 3 and 5 of this Article and Article\u00a015(1).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Traffic data necessary for the purposes of subscriber billing and interconnection payments may be processed. Such processing is permissible only up to the end of the period during which the bill may lawfully be challenged or payment pursued.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of marketing electronic communications services or for the provision of value added services, the provider of a publicly available electronic communications service may process the data referred to in paragraph\u00a01 to the extent and for the duration necessary for such services or marketing, if the subscriber or user to whom the data relate has given his or her prior consent.

The service provider must inform the users or subscribers, prior to obtaining their consent, of the type of location data other than traffic data which will be processed, of the purposes and duration of the processing and whether the data will be transmitted to a third party for the purpose of providing the value added service.\u00a0\u2026\u2019\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a015 of Directive 2002/58, headed \u2018Application of certain provisions of Directive [95/46]\u2019, provides, in paragraph\u00a01 thereof:\n\u2018Member States may adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope of the rights and obligations provided for in Article\u00a05, Article\u00a06, Article\u00a08(1), (2), (3) and (4), and Article\u00a09 of this Directive when such restriction constitutes a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society to safeguard national security (i.e. State security), defence, public security, and the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of unauthorised use of the electronic communication system, as referred to in Article\u00a013(1) of Directive [95/46]. To this end, Member States may, inter alia, adopt legislative measures providing for the retention of data for a limited period justified on the grounds laid down in this paragraph. All the measures referred to in this paragraph shall be in accordance with the general principles of Community law, including those referred to in Article\u00a06(1) and (2) [TEU].\u2019\n\u00a0\nDirective 2003/6\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a01, 2, 12, 37, 41 and 44 of Directive 2003/6 are worded as follows:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A genuine Single Market for financial services is crucial for economic growth and job creation in the Community. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An integrated and efficient financial market requires market integrity.

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by [the Charter] and in particular by Article\u00a011 thereof and Article\u00a010 of the European Convention [for the Protection of] Human Rights [and Fundamental Freedoms].\u00a0\u2026\u2019\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a011 of that directive provides:\n\u2018Without prejudice to the competences of the judicial authorities, each Member State shall designate a single administrative authority competent to ensure that the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive are applied.\n\u2026\u2019\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a012 of that directive provides:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authority shall be given all supervisory and investigatory powers that are necessary for the exercise of its functions.\u00a0\u2026\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to Article\u00a06(7), the powers referred to in paragraph\u00a01 of this Article shall be exercised in conformity with national law and shall include at least the right to:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0have access to any document in any form whatsoever, and to receive a copy of it;\n\u2026\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0require existing telephone and existing data traffic records;\n\u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\nRegulation No\u00a0596/2014\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulation No\u00a0596/2014 repealed and replaced Directive\u00a02003/6 with effect from 3\u00a0July 2016.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a01, 2, 7, 24, 44, 62, 65, 66, 77 and 86 of that regulation are worded as follows:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A genuine internal market for financial services is crucial for economic growth and job creation in the Union.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An integrated, efficient and transparent financial market requires market integrity. The smooth functioning of securities markets and public confidence in markets are prerequisites for economic growth and wealth. Market abuse harms the integrity of financial markets and public confidence in securities and derivatives.\n\u2026\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Market abuse is a concept that encompasses unlawful behaviour in the financial markets and, for the purposes of this Regulation, it should be understood to consist of insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information and market manipulation. Such behaviour prevents full and proper market transparency, which is a prerequisite for trading for all economic actors in integrated financial markets.\n\u2026\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where a legal or natural person in possession of inside information acquires or disposes of, or attempts to acquire or dispose of, for his own account or for the account of a third party, directly or indirectly, financial instruments to which that information relates, it should be implied that that person has used that information. That presumption is without prejudice to the rights of the defence. The question whether a person has infringed the prohibition on insider dealing or has attempted to commit insider dealing should be analysed in the light of the purpose of this Regulation, which is to protect the integrity of the financial market and to enhance investor confidence, which is based, in turn, on the assurance that investors will be placed on an equal footing and protected from the misuse of inside information.\n\u2026\n(44)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many financial instruments are priced by reference to benchmarks. The actual or attempted manipulation of benchmarks, including interbank offer rates, can have a serious impact on market confidence and may result in significant losses to investors or distort the real economy.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A set of effective tools and powers and resources for the competent authority of each Member State guarantees supervisory effectiveness. Accordingly, this Regulation, in particular, provides for a minimum set of supervisory and investigative powers competent authorities of Member States should be entrusted with under national law. Those powers should be exercised, where the national law so requires, by application to the competent judicial authorities.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(65)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Existing recordings of telephone conversations and data traffic records from investment firms, credit institutions and financial institutions executing and documenting the execution of transactions, as well as existing telephone and data traffic records from telecommunications operators, constitute crucial, and sometimes the only, evidence to detect and prove the existence of insider dealing and market manipulation. Telephone and data traffic records may establish the identity of a person responsible for the dissemination of false or misleading information or that persons have been in contact at a certain time, and that a relationship exists between two or more people. Therefore, competent authorities should be able to require existing recordings of telephone conversations, electronic communications and data traffic records held by an investment firm, a credit institution or a financial institution in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU [of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15\u00a0May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (OJ 2014 L\u00a0173, p.\u00a0349)]. Access to data and telephone records is necessary to provide evidence and investigate leads on possible insider dealing or market manipulation, and therefore for detecting and imposing sanctions for market abuse. In order to introduce a level playing field in the Union in relation to the access to telephone and existing data traffic records held by a telecommunications operator or the existing recordings of telephone conversations and data traffic held by an investment firm, a credit institution or a financial institution, competent authorities should, in accordance with national law, be able to require existing telephone and existing data traffic records held by a telecommunications operator, in so far as permitted under national law and existing recordings of telephone conversations as well as data traffic held by an investment firm, in cases where a reasonable suspicion exists that such records related to the subject matter of the inspection or investigation may be relevant to prove insider dealing or market manipulation infringing this Regulation. Access to telephone and data traffic records held by a telecommunications operator does not encompass access to the content of voice communications by telephone.\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While this Regulation specifies a minimum set of powers competent authorities should have, those powers are to be exercised within a complete system of national law which guarantees the respect for fundamental rights, including the right to privacy. For the exercise of those powers, which may amount to serious interferences with the right to respect for private and family life, home and communications, Member States should have in place adequate and effective safeguards against any abuse, for instance, where appropriate a requirement to obtain prior authorisation from the judicial authorities of a Member State concerned. Member States should allow the possibility for competent authorities to exercise such intrusive powers to the extent necessary for the proper investigation of serious cases where there are no equivalent means for effectively achieving the same result.\n\u2026\n(77)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the [Charter].

Specifically, VD and SR, relying on the case-law arising from the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), challenged the fact that that authority took Article\u00a0L.\u00a0621-10 of the CMF and Article\u00a0L.\u00a034-1 of the CPCE as its legal basis for the collection of those data, while those provisions, first, did not comply with EU law in so far as they provided for general and indiscriminate retention of connection data and, second, laid down no restrictions on the powers of the AMF\u2019s investigators to require the retained data to be provided to them. \n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By two judgments of the cour d\u2019appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) of 20\u00a0December 2018 and 7\u00a0March 2019, that court rejected the action brought by VD and SR. It is apparent from the information in the requests for a preliminary ruling that, when it rejected the plea alleging, in essence, infringement of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, the court adjudicating on the substance of the case relied, inter alia, on the fact that Article\u00a023(2)(h) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, relating to market abuse, allows the competent authorities to require, in so far as permitted by national law, existing data traffic records held by operators providing electronic communications services, where there is a reasonable suspicion of an infringement of the prohibition on insider dealing under Article\u00a014(a) and (b) of that regulation and where such records may be relevant to the investigation of that infringement. \n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VD and SR brought an appeal against those judgments before the referring court, raising a plea alleging infringement, inter alia, of the provisions of the Charter and Directive 2002/58 referred to in the preceding paragraph.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards access to the connection data, the referring court refers to a decision of the Conseil constitutionnel (Constitutional Council, France) of 21\u00a0July 2017, from which it is apparent that the procedure for accessing personal data retained by the AMF investigators, as provided for by French law, is not consistent with the right to respect for privacy, as protected by Article\u00a02 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, stating that, although the national legislature had given authorised agents who are obliged to observe professional secrecy the power to obtain such data in the context of an investigation and had not given them enforcement powers, it had not, however, built into that procedure any other guarantee such as to ensure an equal balance between, first, the right of respect for privacy and, second, the prevention of breaches of public order and the investigation of offenders, with the result that the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article\u00a0L.\u00a0621-10 of the CMF had to be declared to be contrary to the French Constitution.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court also notes, first, that the Conseil constitutionnel (Constitutional Council) took the view that, in view of the \u2018manifestly excessive\u2019 consequences that immediate repeal of that provision might have for pending proceedings, it was necessary to defer the date of that repeal to 31\u00a0December 2018 and, second, that the national legislature, drawing the appropriate conclusions from the declaration that the first paragraph of Article\u00a0L.\u00a0621-10 of the CMF was unconstitutional, inserted Article\u00a0L.\u00a0621-10-2 into that code.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court, while recalling the findings set out in paragraph\u00a0125 of the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), is of the opinion that, in view of the fact that the effects of the repeal of the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article\u00a0L.\u00a0621-10 of the CMF, applicable at the material time, were postponed, it cannot result from the declaration that that provision is unconstitutional that it is invalid. It takes the view, however, that the power of AMF investigators under that provision to obtain connection data without prior review by a court or an independent administrative authority is inconsistent with the requirements of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 of the Charter, as interpreted by the Court. \n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the only question that arises in that regard is whether it is possible to postpone the temporal effects of the repeal of Article\u00a0L.\u00a0621-10 of the CMF, even though it does not comply with the Charter. \n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the retention of connection data, the referring court states first of all that, although point\u00a0II of Article\u00a0L.\u00a034-1 of the CPCE lays down an obligation in principle, according to which operators providing electronic communications services must erase or make anonymous any traffic data, that obligation is nevertheless accompanied by a number of exceptions, including the exception laid down in point\u00a0III of that provision, relating to \u2018the purposes of investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences\u2019. For those specific purposes, the operations to erase or make anonymous certain pieces of data would be deferred for one year. \n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It states, in that regard, that the five categories of data concerned in particular by the conditions laid down in point\u00a0III of Article\u00a0L.\u00a034-1 of the CPCE are those set out in Article\u00a0R.\u00a010-13 of the CPCE. Those connection data are generated or processed following a communication and relate to the circumstances of that communication and service users, but give no indication of the content of the communications concerned.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, the referring court makes reference to paragraph\u00a0112 of the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), according to which Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which, for the purpose of fighting crime, provides for the general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data of all subscribers and registered users relating to all means of electronic communication, and observes that, in the context of the cases in the main proceedings, the AMF had access to the data retained by operators providing electronic communications services as there were suspicions concerning insider dealing and market abuse that may fall within the scope of a number of serious offences. That access was justified by the need for that authority, in order to ensure the effectiveness of its investigation, to cross-reference various pieces of retained data over a certain period of time, with a view to updating the inside information being exchanged by a number of interlocutors, which revealed the existence of unlawful practices in that regard.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, the investigations carried out by the AMF satisfy the obligations imposed on the Member States by Article\u00a012(2)(d) of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a023(2)(g) and (h) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, read in the light of Article\u00a01 of that regulation, including, in particular, the obligation to require existing data traffic records held by operators providing electronic communications services to be submitted. \n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, that court, first, refers to recital\u00a065 of that regulation and observes that those connection data constitute crucial, and sometimes the only, evidence to detect and prove the existence of insider dealing since they make it possible to establish the identity of a person responsible for the dissemination of false or misleading information or that persons have been in contact at a certain time. \n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the referring court cites recital\u00a066 of that regulation, from which it is apparent that the exercise of powers conferred on competent authorities in the field of finance may interfere with the right to respect for private and family life, home and communications and that, consequently, Member States should have in place adequate and effective safeguards against any abuse by restricting the scope of those powers solely to where they are necessary for the proper investigation of serious cases where there are no equivalent means for effectively achieving the same result. According to that court, it follows from that recital that certain cases of market abuse must be regarded as serious infringements.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court also observes that, in the cases in the main proceedings, the inside information that may have constituted the substantive element of the unlawful market practices was essentially oral information that was secret.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the findings above, the referring court is uncertain how to reconcile Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter with the requirements under Article\u00a012(2)(d) of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a023(2)(g) and (h) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014. \n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, should the Court find that the legislation on the retention of the connection data at issue in the main proceedings does not comply with EU law, the question arises as to whether that legislation retains its effects provisionally, in order to avoid legal uncertainty and to allow the data previously collected and retained to be used for the purpose of detecting insider dealing and bringing criminal proceedings in respect of it.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions, which are worded identically in Cases C-399/20 and C-397/20, to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do Article\u00a012(2)(a) and (d) of Directive [2003/6] and Article\u00a023(2)(g) and (h) of Regulation [No\u00a0596/2014], which replaced that directive from 3\u00a0July 2016, read in the light of recital\u00a065 of that regulation, not imply that, account being taken of the covert nature of the information exchanged and the fact that the potential subjects of investigation are members of the general public, the national legislature must be able to require electronic communications operators to retain connection data on a temporary but general basis in order to enable the administrative authority referred to in Article\u00a011 of [Directive 2003/6] and Article\u00a022 of [Regulation No\u00a0596/2014], in the event of the emergence of grounds for suspecting certain persons of being involved in insider dealing or market manipulation, to require the operator to surrender existing records of traffic data in cases where there are reasons to suspect that the records so linked to the subject matter of the investigation may prove relevant to the production of evidence of the actual commission of the breach, to the extent, in particular, that they offer a means of tracing the contacts established by the persons concerned before the suspicions emerged?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the answer\u00a0\u2026 [to the first question] is such as to prompt the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) to form the view that the French legislation on the retention of connection data is not consistent with EU law, could the effects of that legislation be temporarily maintained in order to avoid legal uncertainty and to enable data previously collected and retained to be used for one of the objectives of that legislation?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May a national court temporarily maintain the effects of legislation enabling the officials of an independent administrative authority responsible for investigating market abuse to obtain access to obtain connection data without prior review by a court or another independent administrative authority?\u2019\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of the President of the Court of 17\u00a0September 2020, Cases C-339/20 and C-397/20 were joined for the purposes of the written and oral parts of the procedure and of the judgment.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 21\u00a0April 2021, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State, France) delivered the judgment in \nFrench Data Network and Others\n (No\u00a0393099, 394922, 397844, 397851, 424717, 424718), by which it ruled, inter alia, on the compatibility with EU law of certain national legislative provisions which are relevant to the disputes in the main proceedings, namely Article\u00a0L.\u00a034-1 of the CPCE and Article\u00a0R.\u00a010-13 of the CPCE.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the Court\u2019s invitation, the participants in the hearings in the present cases were given the opportunity to express their views on the effect, if any, of that judgment of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State) on the present references for a preliminary ruling.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The representative of the French Government stated at that hearing that, by that judgment, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State), in essence, declared unlawful the provisions implementing the general and indiscriminate retention of connection data for the purposes of fighting crime with the exception of the retention of IP addresses and data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications networks, thereby giving due effect to the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791). He stated, however, that, in the context of the proceedings, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State) also had to respond to the French Government\u2019s objection that that interpretation of EU law was inconsistent with rules of constitutional status, namely those relating to the prevention of breaches of public order, in particular the safety of persons and property, and the investigation of offenders.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the representative of the French Government explained that the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State) had rejected that objection in two stages. First, it is true that it acknowledged that the general and indiscriminate retention of the connection data was a decisive factor for the success of criminal investigations and that no other method could effectively take the place of those investigations. Second, however, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State) relied, in particular, on paragraph\u00a0164 of the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), and took the view that the expedited retention of data was authorised by EU law including where that expedited retention related to data initially retained for the purpose of safeguarding national security. \n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the representative of the French Government noted that, following the judgment of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State) of 21\u00a0April 2021, \nFrench Data Network and Others\n (No\u00a0393099, 394922, 397844, 397851, 424717 and 424718), the national legislature had inserted point\u00a0III bis into Article\u00a0L.\u00a034-1 of the Post and Electronic Communications Code, as mentioned in paragraph\u00a021 of the present judgment.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nPreliminary observations \n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it should be noted that, after the present requests for a preliminary ruling had been lodged, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State) delivered the judgment of 21\u00a0April 2021, \nFrench Data Network and Others\n (No\u00a0393099, 394922, 397844, 397851, 424717, 424718), concerning, inter alia, the compatibility with EU law of Article\u00a0L.\u00a034-1 of the CPCE and Article\u00a0R.\u00a010-13 of the CPCE. \n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a042 of his Opinion, and as is also apparent from the explanations provided by the referring court, as set out in paragraphs\u00a027, 37 and 38 above, those articles are \u2018key provisions\u2019 in the context of the application of Article\u00a0L.\u00a0621-10 of the CMF, which is at issue in the main proceedings. \n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the hearing before the Court, after highlighting the legislative development of Article\u00a0L.\u00a034-1 of the CPCE in response to the clarifications provided by the Court in the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), as referred to in paragraph\u00a021 of the present judgment, the representative of the French Government indicated, in essence, that, in order to resolve the disputes in the main proceedings, the referring court was required, in accordance with the principle of the application of the law \nratione temporis\n enshrined in Article\u00a07 and 8 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, to take account of provisions of national law in the version applicable to the facts at issue in the main proceedings, which date from 2014 and 2015, with the result that the judgment of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State) of 21\u00a0April 2021, \nFrench Data Network and Others \n(No\u00a0393099, 394922, 397844, 397851, 424717, 424718) could not be taken into consideration in any event when analysing the present requests for a preliminary ruling\n. \n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to settled case-law, in proceedings under Article\u00a0267 TFEU, it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, where the questions submitted by the national court concern the interpretation of Union law, the Court of Justice is, in principle, bound to give a ruling (see, to that effect, judgment of 8\u00a0September 2010, \nWinner Wetten\n, C-409/06, EU:C:2010:503, paragraph\u00a036 and the case-law cited).\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (see, to that effect, judgment of 19\u00a0November 2009, \nFilipiak\n, C-314/08, EU:C:2009:719, paragraph\u00a042 and the case-law cited).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the orders for reference that the first and third questions directly concern, not Article\u00a0L.\u00a034-1 of the CPCE and Article\u00a0R.\u00a010-13 of the CPCE, but Article\u00a0L.\u00a0621-10 of the CMF, pursuant to which the AMF asked operators providing electronic communications services to submit to it traffic data relating to telephone calls made by VD and SR, on the basis of which an investigation was opened into them and the admissibility of which as evidence is disputed in the main proceedings. \n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it should be noted that, by the second and third questions referred in the present cases, which are an extension of the first questions, the referring court asks, in essence, whether, in the event that the national legislation at issue relating to the retention of and access to connection data proves to be incompatible with EU law, its effects could not, nevertheless, be provisionally maintained, so as to avoid legal uncertainty and to allow the data retained on the basis of that legislation to be used for the purposes of detecting insider dealing and bringing prosecutions accordingly. \n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the considerations above, as well as those referred to by the Advocate General in points\u00a044 to 47 of his Opinion, it must be held that, irrespective of the judgment of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (Council of State) of 21\u00a0April 2021, \nFrench Data Network and Others\n (No\u00a0393099, 394922, 397844, 397851, 424717, 424718), and of the decision of the Conseil constitutionnel (Constitutional Council) of 25\u00a0February 2022 (No\u00a02021-976/977), which declared Article\u00a0L.\u00a034-1 of the CPCE, in the version referred to in paragraph\u00a020 of the present judgment, to be unconstitutional in part, an answer from the Court to the questions referred remains necessary in order to resolve the disputes in the main proceedings.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it should be noted that, at the hearing before the Court, VD\u2019s representative disputed the applicability \nratione temporis\n of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, claiming, in essence, that the facts at issue in the main proceedings had occurred before the entry into force of that regulation. Therefore, only the provisions of Directive 2003/6 are relevant for the purposes of examining the questions referred by the national court.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, a new rule of law applies from the entry into force of the act introducing it, and, while it does not apply to legal situations that have arisen and become final under the old law, it does apply to their future effects, and to new legal situations. The position is otherwise, subject to the principle of the non-retroactivity of legal acts, only if the new rule is accompanied by special provisions which specifically lay down its conditions of temporal application (see, to that effect, judgments of 15\u00a0January 2019, \nE.B\n., C-258/17, EU:C:2019:17, paragraph\u00a050 and the case-law cited, and of 14\u00a0May 2020, \nAzienda Municipale Ambiente\n, C-15/19, EU:C:2020:371, paragraph\u00a057).\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As has been pointed out in paragraphs\u00a026 to 29 above, although the legal situations concerned by the cases in the main proceedings arose before the entry into force of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, which repealed and replaced Directive 2003/6 with effect from 3\u00a0July 2016, the proceedings in the main proceedings continued after that date, with the result that, as from that date, the future effects of those situations are, in accordance with the principle recalled in the preceding paragraph, governed by Regulation No\u00a0596/2014.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the provisions of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014 are applicable in the present case. Moreover, there is no need to draw a distinction between the provisions referred to by the referring court resulting from Directive 2003/6 and Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, since their scope is essentially similar for the purposes of the interpretation which the Court will be required to give in the present cases.\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n\u00a0\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a012(2)(a) and (d) of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a023(2)(g) and (h) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, read in conjunction with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, and in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding legislative measures such as the one at issue in the main proceedings which, as a preventive measure, in order to combat market abuse offences including insider dealing, provide for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic data for a year from the date on which they were recorded.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties to the main proceedings and the interested parties that submitted written observations to the Court have expressed differing views in that regard. For the Estonian Government, for Ireland and for the Spanish and French Governments, Article\u00a012(2)(a) and (d) of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a023(2)(g) and (h) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014 implicitly but necessarily empower the national legislature to impose a general and indiscriminate obligation on operators providing electronic communications services to retain data in order to allow the competent financial authority to detect and impose sanctions for insider dealing. Since, as is apparent from recital\u00a065 of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, those records constitute crucial, and sometimes the only, evidence to detect and prove the existence of insider dealing, such an obligation to retain is necessary both for ensuring the efficacy of instigations led by and prosecutions brought by that authority and, at the same time, the effectiveness of Article\u00a012(2)(a) and (d) of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a023(2)(h) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, and in order to meet the general interest objectives pursued by those instruments, which seek to guarantee the integrity of the EU financial markets and to enhance investor confidence in those markets.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VD, SR, the Polish Government and the European Commission submit, on the other hand, that those provisions, in so far as they merely provide a framework for the power to require operators providing electronic communications services to send \u2018existing\u2019 traffic data records held by those operators, govern only the issue of access to those data.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted, in the first place, that it is settled case-law that, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary not only to refer to its wording but also to consider its context and the objectives of the legislation of which it forms part, and in particular the origin of that legislation (see, to that effect, judgment of 17\u00a0April 2018, \nEgenberger\n, C-414/16, EU:C:2018:257, paragraph\u00a044).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the wording of the provisions referred to in the first question, it should be noted that, while Article\u00a012(2)(d) of Directive 2003/6 refers to the power of the competent financial authority to \u2018require existing telephone and existing data traffic records\u2019, Article\u00a023(2)(g) and (h) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014 refers to the power of that authority to require, first, \u2018existing\u00a0\u2026 data traffic records held by investment firms, credit institutions or financial institutions\u2019 and, second, to require, \u2018in so far as permitted by national law, existing data traffic records held by a telecommunications operator\u2019. \n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from the wording of those provisions that they merely provide a framework for that authority\u2019s power to \u2018require\u2019 the data available to those operators, which corresponds to access to those data. Furthermore, the reference made to \u2018existing\u2019 records, such as those \u2018held\u2019 by those operators, suggests that the EU legislature did not intend to lay down rules governing the option open to the national legislature to impose an obligation to retain such records.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in accordance with settled case-law, an interpretation of a provision of EU law cannot have the result of depriving the clear and precise wording of that provision of all effectiveness. Thus, where the meaning of a provision of EU law is absolutely plain from its very wording, the Court cannot depart from that interpretation (judgment of 25\u00a0January 2022, \nVYSO\u010cINA WIND\n, C-181/20, EU:C:2022:51, paragraph\u00a039 and the case-law cited).\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The interpretation outlined in paragraph\u00a070 above is supported both by the context of Article\u00a012(2)(a) and (d) of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a023(2)(g) and (h) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, and by the objectives pursued by the rules of which those provisions form part.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the context of those provisions, it should be noted that, although, under Article\u00a012(1) of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a023(3) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, read in the light of recital\u00a062 of that regulation, the EU legislature intended to require the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the competent financial authorities have a set of effective tools, powers and resources as well as the necessary supervisory and investigatory powers to ensure the effectiveness of their duties, those provisions make no mention of any option open to Member States of imposing, for that purpose, an obligation on operators providing electronic communications services to retain generally and indiscriminately traffic data, nor do they set out the conditions in which those data must be retained by those operators so that they can be submitted to the competent authorities where appropriate. \n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Article\u00a012(2) of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a023(2) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, the EU legislature merely intended to grant to the competent financial authority, in order to ensure the effectiveness of its investigative and supervisory duties, ordinary powers of investigation, such as those enabling that authority to have access to documents, to carry out inspections and searches, or to issue orders or prohibitions against persons suspected of having committed market abuse offences including, inter alia, insider dealing. \n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it is clear that the provisions of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014 which specifically govern the question of data retention, namely the final subparagraph of Article\u00a011(5), the second subparagraph of Article\u00a011(6), Article\u00a011(8), Article\u00a011(11)(c), the first subparagraph of Article\u00a017(1), Article\u00a018(5) and Article\u00a028 of that regulation, impose such an obligation to retain only on financial operators, as listed in Article\u00a023(2)(g) of that regulation, and therefore concern only data relating to financial transactions and services provided by those specific operators.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objectives pursued by the legislation at issue, it must be observed that it is apparent, first, from recitals\u00a02 and 12 of Directive 2003/6 and, second, from Article\u00a01 of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, read in the light of recitals\u00a02 and 24 thereof, that the purpose of those instruments is to protect the integrity of EU financial markets and to enhance investor confidence in those markets, a confidence which depends, inter alia, on investors being placed on an equal footing and being protected against the improper use of inside information. The purpose of the prohibition on insider dealing laid down in Article\u00a02(1) of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a08(1) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014 is to ensure equality between the contracting parties in stock-market transactions by preventing one of them who possesses inside information and who is, therefore, in an advantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis other investors, from profiting from that information, to the detriment of those who are unaware of it (see, to that effect, judgment of 15\u00a0March 2022, \nAutorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers\n, C-302/20, EU:C:2022:190, paragraphs\u00a043, 65 and 77 and the case-law cited).\n\u00a0\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although, according to recital\u00a065 of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, connection data records constitute crucial, and sometimes the only, evidence to detect and prove the existence of insider dealing and market manipulation, the fact remains that that recital makes reference only to records \u2018held\u2019 by operators providing electronic communications services and to the power of that competent financial authority to \u2018require\u2019 those operators to send \u2018existing\u2019 data. Thus, it is in no way apparent from that recital that the EU legislature intended, by that regulation, to give Member States the power to impose on operators providing electronic communications services a general obligation to retain data.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, it must be held that neither Directive 2003/6 nor Regulation No\u00a0596/2014 can be interpreted as capable of constituting the legal basis for a general obligation to retain the data traffic records held by operators providing electronic communications services for the purposes of exercising the powers conferred on the competent financial authority under Directive 2003/6 and Regulation No\u00a0596/2014.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it should be borne in mind that, as the Advocate General noted, in essence, in points\u00a053 and 61 of his Opinion, Directive 2002/58 is the measure of reference on the retention and, more generally, the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector, which means that the Court\u2019s interpretation in the light of that directive also governs the traffic data records held by operators providing electronic communications services, which the competent financial authorities, within the meaning of Article\u00a011 of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a022 of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, may require from those operators.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2002/58, that directive provides, inter alia, for the harmonisation of the national provisions required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy and confidentiality, with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic communication sector, the latter of which also covers the telecommunications sector.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it is apparent from Article\u00a03 of that directive that it is to apply to the processing of personal data in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services in public communications networks in the European Union, including public communications networks supporting data collection and identification devices. Consequently, that directive must be regarded as regulating the activities of the providers of such services, including, in particular, telecommunications operators (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a093 and the case-law cited).\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, it must be held that, as the Advocate General submits, in essence, in points\u00a062 and 63 of his Opinion, the assessment of the lawfulness of the processing of records held by operators providing electronic communications services, as provided for in Article\u00a012(2)(d) of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a023(2)(g) and (h) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, must be carried out in the light of the conditions laid down by Directive 2002/58 and of the interpretation of that directive in the Court\u2019s case-law.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is borne out by Article\u00a03(1)(27) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, in that it provides that, for the purposes of that regulation, traffic data records are those defined in point (b) of the second paragraph of Article\u00a02 of Directive 2002/58.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, according to recital\u00a044 of Directive 2003/6 and recitals\u00a066 and 77 of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, the purposes of those instruments are to pursue the fundamental rights and principles enshrined in the Charter, including the right to privacy. In that regard, the EU legislature expressly stated in recital\u00a066 of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014 that, for the purposes of exercising the powers conferred on the competent financial authority under that regulation, which may amount to serious interferences with the right to respect for private and family life, home and communications, Member States should have in place adequate and effective safeguards against any abuse, for instance, where appropriate a requirement to obtain prior authorisation from the judicial authorities of a Member State concerned. Member States should make provision for the competent authorities to exercise such intrusive powers only to the extent that they are necessary for the proper conduct of an investigation into serious cases where there are no equivalent means for effectively arriving at the same result. It follows that the application of the measures governed by Directive 2003/6 and by Regulation No\u00a0596/2014 cannot, in any event, undermine the protection of personal data conferred under Directive 2002/58 (see, by analogy, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008, \nPromusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraph\u00a057, and of 17\u00a0June 2021, \nM.I.C.M.\n, C-597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraph\u00a0124 and the case-law cited).\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, Article\u00a012(2)(a) and (d) of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a023(2)(g) and (h) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014 must be interpreted as not authorising the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data for the purpose of combating market abuse offences and, in particular, insider dealing, since the compatibility with EU law of provisions of national law providing for such retention must be assessed in the light of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, as interpreted in the Court\u2019s case-law.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the examination of whether such national legislation is compatible with those provisions, it must be borne in mind that, as is apparent, in essence, from a combined reading of paragraphs\u00a053, 54 and 58 of the present judgment, although the provision at the heart of the present references for a preliminary ruling is Article\u00a0L.\u00a0621-10 of the CMF, under which the AMF requested operators providing electronic communications services to transmit traffic data relating to telephone calls made by VD and SR, on the basis of which an investigation was opened into the latter, the fact remains that, as the Advocate General noted in point\u00a042 of his Opinion, Article\u00a034-1 of the CPCE and Article\u00a0R.\u00a010-13 of the CPCE are \u2018key provisions\u2019 for the application of Article\u00a0L.\u00a0621-10 of the CMF. \n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the explanations provided by the referring court, as summarised in paragraphs\u00a027, 37 and 38 of the present judgment, that, first, the AMF investigators had collected the traffic data at issue on the basis of Article\u00a0L.\u00a034-1 of the CPCE, in the version applicable to the disputes in the main proceedings, point\u00a0III of which established a certain number of exceptions to the obligation in principle laid down in point\u00a0II of that article, according to which operators providing electronic communications services had to erase or make anonymous any traffic data, one exception of which related to \u2018the purposes of investigating, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences\u2019. For those specific purposes, operations for the erasing or making anonymous of certain types of data were deferred for one year.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, that court states that the five categories of data concerned by point\u00a0III of Article\u00a0L.\u00a034-1 of the CPCE, in the version applicable to the disputes in the main proceedings, were those listed in Article\u00a0R.\u00a010-13 of the CPCE, namely (i) information identifying the user, (ii) data relating to the communications terminal equipment used, (iii) the technical characteristics and date, time and duration of each communication, (iv) data relating to the additional services requested or used and the providers of those services and (v) data identifying the addressee or addressees of the communication. It is also clear from point\u00a0II of Article\u00a0R.\u00a010-13 of the CPCE, in the version applicable to the main proceedings, that, in the case of telephony activities, the operators concerned could also retain data enabling the origin and location of the communication to be identified.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the legislation at issue in the main proceedings covers all means of telephone communications and applies to all users of such means, without distinction or exception. Furthermore, the data which must be retained by operators providing electronic communications services under that legislation are, in particular, the data necessary for locating the source of a communication and its destination, for determining the date, time, duration and type of communication, for identifying the communications equipment used, and for locating the terminal equipment and communications, data which comprise, inter alia, the name and address of the user, the telephone numbers of the caller and the person called. \n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, although the data which must, under the national legislation at issue, be retained for a period of one year do not cover the content of the communications concerned, they make it possible, inter alia, to identify the person with whom the user of a means of telephone communication has communicated and how, to determine the date, time and duration of the communications and the place from which those communications and connections took place, and to ascertain the location of the terminal equipment without any communication necessarily having been transmitted. In addition, those data enable the frequency of a user\u2019s communications with certain persons over a given period of time to be established. Therefore, it is necessary to take the view that those data, taken as a whole, may allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data have been retained, such as the habits of everyday life, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social relationships of those persons and the social environments frequented by them. In particular, those data provide the means of establishing a profile of the individuals concerned, information that is no less sensitive, having regard to the right to privacy, than the actual content of communications (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a045 and the case-law cited).\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objectives pursued, the purpose of the legislation at issue is, inter alia, the investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, including those relating to market abuse such as insider dealing. \n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the factors set out in paragraphs\u00a086 to 91 above, it must be held that, for the purposes, inter alia, of the investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences and the fight against crime, the national legislature provided, by the legislation at issue, for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic data for one year from the day on which it was recorded.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent, in particular, from paragraphs\u00a0140 to 168 of the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), and from paragraphs\u00a059 to 101 of the judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n (C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258), that such retention cannot be justified by such objectives under Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58. \n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which requires operators providing electronic communications services, as a preventive measure, in order to combat market abuse offences including insider dealing, to retain generally and indiscriminately the traffic data of all users of means of electronic communication, with no differentiation in that regard or with no provision made for exceptions and without establishing the link required, in accordance with the case-law referred to in the previous paragraph, between the data to be retained and the objective pursued, falls outside of what is strictly necessary and cannot be considered to be justified, in a democratic society, as is required by Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nPrivacy International\n, C-623/17, EU:C:2020:790, paragraph\u00a081).\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the first question in Cases C-339/20 and C-397/20 is that Article\u00a012(2)(a) and (d) of Directive 2003/6 and Article\u00a023(2)(g) and (h) of Regulation No\u00a0596/2014, read in conjunction with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, and in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding legislative measures which, as a preventive measure, in order to combat market abuse offences including insider dealing, provide for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic data for a year from the date on which they were recorded.\n\u00a0\nThe second and third questions\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second and third questions in the present cases, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether EU law must be interpreted as meaning that a national court may restrict the temporal effects of a declaration of invalidity, under national law, with respect to provisions of national law which, first, require operators providing electronic communications services to retain generally and indiscriminately traffic data and, second, allow such data to be submitted to the competent financial authority, without prior authorisation from a court or independent administrative authority, owing to the incompatibility of that legislation with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 read in the light of the Charter.\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset, it should be recalled that the principle of the primacy of EU law establishes the pre-eminence of EU law over the law of the Member States. That principle therefore requires all Member State bodies to give full effect to the various provisions of EU law, since the law of the Member States may not undermine the effect accorded to those various provisions in the territory of those States. In the light of that principle, where it is unable to interpret national legislation in compliance with the requirements of EU law, the national court which is called upon within the exercise of its jurisdiction to apply provisions of EU law is under a duty to give full effect to those provisions, if necessary refusing of its own motion to apply any conflicting provision of national legislation, even if adopted subsequently, and it is not necessary for that court to request or await the prior setting aside of such provision by legislative or other constitutional means (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0118 and the case-law cited).\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only the Court may, in exceptional cases, on the basis of overriding considerations of legal certainty, allow the temporary suspension of the ousting effect of a rule of EU law with respect to national law that is contrary thereto. Such a restriction on the temporal effects of the interpretation of that law, made by the Court, may be granted only in the actual judgment ruling upon the interpretation requested. The primacy and uniform application of EU law would be undermined if national courts had the power to give provisions of national law primacy in relation to EU law contravened by those provisions, even temporarily (judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0119 and the case-law cited).\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that the Court has held, in a case concerning the lawfulness of measures adopted in breach of the obligation under EU law to conduct a prior assessment of the impact of a project on the environment and on a protected site, that if domestic law allows it, a national court may, by way of exception, maintain the effects of such measures where such maintenance is justified by overriding considerations relating to the need to nullify a genuine and serious threat of interruption in the electricity supply in the Member State concerned, which cannot be remedied by any other means or alternatives, particularly in the context of the internal market, and continues only for as long as is strictly necessary to remedy the breach (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0July 2019, \nInter-Environnement Wallonie and Bond Beter Leefmilieu Vlaanderen\n, C-411/17, EU:C:2019:622, paragraphs\u00a0175, 176, 179 and 181).\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, unlike a breach of a procedural obligation such as the prior assessment of the impact of a project in the specific field of environmental protection, a failure to comply with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, cannot be remedied by a procedure comparable to the procedure referred to in the preceding paragraph (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0121 and the case-law cited).\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maintaining the effects of national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings would mean that the legislation would continue to impose on operators providing electronic communications services obligations which are contrary to EU law and which seriously interfere with the fundamental rights of the persons whose data have been retained (see, by analogy, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0122 and the case-law cited).\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the referring court cannot restrict the temporal effects of a declaration of invalidity which it is bound to make under national law in respect of the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings (see, by analogy, judgment of 5\u00a0April 2022, \nCommissioner of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and Others\n, C-140/20, EU:C:2022:258, paragraph\u00a0123 and the case-law cited).\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it should be stated that a temporal restriction of the effects of the interpretation given was not imposed in the judgments of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige and Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), with the result that, in accordance with the case-law recalled in paragraph\u00a098 of this judgment, it should not be imposed in a judgment of the Court subsequent to those judgments.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, in view of the fact that the referring court is ruling on applications requesting that evidence obtained from traffic data be declared inadmissible on the ground that the national provisions at issue are contrary to EU law, both as regards the retention of data and access to those data, it is necessary to determine the effect of a finding that Article\u00a0L.\u00a0621-10 of the CMF, in the version applicable to the facts at issue in the main proceedings, is incompatible with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, on the admissibility of the evidence adduced against VD and SR in the context of the main proceedings. \n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is sufficient to refer to the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular to the principles recalled in paragraphs\u00a041 to 44 of the judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n (C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152), from which it follows that such admissibility falls, in accordance with the principle of the procedural autonomy of the Member States, within the scope of national law, subject to compliance, inter alia, with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness.\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the latter principle, it should be noted that it requires national criminal courts to disregard information and evidence obtained by means of the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data in breach of EU law or by means of access of the competent authority to those data in breach of EU law, in the context of criminal proceedings against persons suspected of having committed criminal offences, where those persons are not in a position to comment effectively on that information and that evidence and they pertain to a field of which the judges have no knowledge and are likely to have a preponderant influence on the findings of fact (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraph\u00a044 and the case-law cited).\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the findings above, the answer to the second and third questions in the present cases is that EU law must be interpreted as precluding a national court from restricting the temporal effects of a declaration of invalidity which it is required to make, under national law, with respect to provisions of national law which, first, require operators providing electronic communications services to retain generally and indiscriminately traffic data and, second, allow such data to be submitted to the competent financial authority, without prior authorisation from a court or independent administrative authority, owing to the incompatibility of those provisions with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 read in the light of the Charter. The admissibility of evidence obtained pursuant to provisions of national law that are incompatible with EU law is, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy of the Member States, a matter for national law, subject to compliance, inter alia, with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a012(2)(a) and (d) of Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28\u00a0January 2003 on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) and Article\u00a023(2)(g) and (h) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a0596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16\u00a0April 2014 on market abuse (market abuse regulation) and repealing Directive 2003/6 and Commission Directives 2003/124/EC, 2003/125/EC and 2004/72/EC, read in conjunction with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009, and read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union \nmust be interpreted as:\nprecluding legislative measures which, as a preventive measure, in order to combat market abuse offences including insider dealing, provide for the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic data for a year from the date on which they were recorded.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEuropean Union law must be interpreted as precluding a national court from restricting the temporal effects of a declaration of invalidity which it is required to make, under national law, with respect to provisions of national law which, first, require operators providing electronic communications services to retain generally and indiscriminately traffic data and, second, allow such data to be submitted to the competent financial authority, without prior authorisation from a court or independent administrative authority, owing to the incompatibility of those provisions with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, as amended by Directive 2009/136, read in the light of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

Hungary.\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In April 2018, following a technical failure affecting the operation of a server, Digi created a \u2018test\u2019 database (\u2018the test database\u2019), to which it copied the personal data of around one third of its private customers, which were stored in another database, called the \u2018digihu\u2019 database, which could be linked to the website www.digi.hu, containing the up-to-date data of subscribers to Digi\u2019s newsletter, for direct marketing purposes, and the data of systems administrators, giving access to the website interface.\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 23\u00a0September 2019, Digi became aware that an \u2018ethical hacker\u2019 had gained access to the personal data held by it in relation to around 322\u00a0000 persons. Digi was informed of that access by the \u2018ethical hacker\u2019 himself, who sent Digi a line from the test database by way of evidence. Digi corrected the fault which had enabled that access and concluded a confidentiality agreement with the hacker, to whom it offered a reward.\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After deleting the test database, Digi notified the personal data breach to the Authority on 25\u00a0September 2019, and the Authority subsequently opened an investigation.\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 18\u00a0May 2020, the Authority found, inter alia, that Digi had infringed Article\u00a05(1)(b) and (e) of Regulation 2016/679, in that, after carrying out the necessary tests and correcting the fault, it had not immediately deleted the test database, with the result that a large amount of personal data had been stored in that database for no purpose for nearly 18\u00a0months, in a file from which it was possible for the data subjects to be identified. As a consequence, the Authority required Digi to review all its databases and fined it the sum of 100\u00a0000\u00a0000 Hungarian forint (HUF) (around EUR\u00a0248\u00a0000).\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Digi challenged the legality of that decision before the referring court.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court points out that the personal data copied by Digi to the test database were collected for the purposes of the conclusion and performance of subscription contracts and that the lawfulness of the initial collection of the personal data was not called into question by the Authority. It wonders, however, whether the effect of the copying, to another database, of the data initially collected was to change the purpose of the initial collection and the processing of those data. It adds that it must also determine whether the creation of a test database and the further processing, in that other database, of customers\u2019 data are compatible with the purposes of the initial collection. It considers that the principle of \u2018purpose limitation\u2019, as set out in Article\u00a05(1)(b) of Regulation 2016/679, does not enable it to determine the internal systems in which the controller is entitled to process the lawfully collected data or to ascertain whether the controller may copy those data to a test database without changing the purpose of the initial data collection.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the creation of the test database is incompatible with the purpose of the initial collection, the referring court also wonders whether, since the purpose of the processing of subscribers\u2019 data in another database was not to correct errors but to conclude contracts, the necessary retention period must, under the principle of \u2018storage limitation\u2019 appearing in Article\u00a05(1)(e) of Regulation 2016/679, correspond to the period necessary for the correction of errors or to that necessary for the performance of the contractual obligations.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the F\u0151v\u00e1rosi T\u00f6rv\u00e9nysz\u00e9k (Budapest High Court, Hungary) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the concept of \u201cpurpose limitation\u201d as defined in Article\u00a05(1)(b) of [Regulation 2016/679]\u00a0\u2026 be interpreted as meaning that the fact that the controller stores in parallel in another database personal data which were otherwise collected and stored for a limited legitimate purpose is consistent with that concept or, conversely, is the limited legitimate purpose of collecting those data no longer valid so far as the parallel database is concerned?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should the answer to the first question referred be that the parallel storage of data is in principle incompatible with the principle of \u201cpurpose limitation\u201d, is the fact that the controller stores in parallel in another database personal data which were otherwise collected and stored for a limited legitimate purpose compatible with the principle of \u201cstorage limitation\u201d established in Article\u00a05(1)(e) of [Regulation 2016/679]?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Authority and the Hungarian Government expressed doubts as to the admissibility of the questions referred, on the ground that those questions do not correspond to the facts of the dispute in the main proceedings and are not directly relevant to the resolution of that dispute.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, first, it should be recalled that it follows from settled case-law of the Court that it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, where the questions referred concern the interpretation or the validity of a rule of EU law, the Court is in principle bound to give a ruling. It follows that questions referred by national courts enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court only where it appears that the interpretation sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its object, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a073 and the case-law cited).\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, the referring court has before it an action seeking annulment of a decision penalising Digi, in its capacity as controller, for having breached the principle of \u2018purpose limitation\u2019 and the principle of \u2018storage limitation\u2019, laid down, respectively, in Article\u00a05(1)(b) and (e) of Regulation 2016/679, by having failed to delete a database containing personal data permitting identification of the data subjects. The questions referred relate precisely to the interpretation of those provisions, with the result that it cannot be found that the interpretation sought of EU law bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or to its object or is hypothetical. Moreover, the order for reference contains sufficient factual and legal material to give a useful answer to the questions submitted by the referring court.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, it is important to recall that, in proceedings under Article\u00a0267 TFEU, which are based on a clear separation of functions between the national courts and the Court, the national court alone has jurisdiction to interpret and apply national law, while the Court is empowered only to give rulings on the interpretation or the validity of an EU provision on the basis of the facts which the national court puts before it (judgment of 5\u00a0May 2022, \nZagreba\u010dka banka\n, C-567/20, EU:C:2022:352, paragraph\u00a045 and the case-law cited).\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the argument relating to the inadmissibility of the questions referred, which the Authority and the Hungarian Government base, in essence, on the claim that the questions referred do not correspond to the facts of the dispute in the main proceedings, must be rejected.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the questions referred are admissible.\n\u00a0\nSubstance\n\u00a0\nFirst question\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a05(1)(b) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the principle of \u2018purpose limitation\u2019, laid down in that provision, precludes the recording and storage by the controller, in a database created for the purposes of carrying out tests and correcting errors, of personal data previously collected and stored in another database.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with settled case-law, the interpretation of a provision of EU law requires account to be taken not only of its wording, but also of its context, and the objectives and purpose pursued by the act of which it forms part (judgment of 1\u00a0August 2022, \nHOLD Alapkezel\u0151\n, C-352/20, EU:C:2022:606, paragraph\u00a042 and the case-law cited).\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in the first place, it should be pointed out that Article\u00a05(1) of Regulation 2016/679 establishes the principles relating to the processing of personal data, which apply to the controller and with which the controller must be able to demonstrate compliance, in accordance with the principle of accountability set out in Article\u00a05(2).\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, under Article\u00a05(1)(b) of that regulation, which sets out the principle of \u2018purpose limitation\u2019, personal data are, first, to be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and, second, not to be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is thus apparent from the wording of that provision that it comprises two requirements, one relating to the purposes of the initial collection of the personal data and the other concerning the further processing of those data.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding, first, the requirement that personal data are to be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, it follows from the case-law of the Court that that requirement implies, first of all, that the purposes of the processing are to be identified at the latest at the time of the collection of the personal data, next, that the purposes of that processing are to be clearly stated and, finally, that the purposes of that processing are to guarantee, inter alia, the lawfulness of the processing of those data, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679 (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0February 2022, \nValsts ie\u0146\u0113mumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)\n, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraphs\u00a064 to 66).\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, it is apparent from the wording of the first question and the grounds of the order for reference that the personal data at issue in the main proceedings were collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, with the referring court specifying, in addition, that those data were collected for the purposes of the conclusion and performance by Digi of subscription contracts with its customers, in accordance with Article\u00a06(1)(b) of Regulation 2016/679.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard, secondly, to the requirement that the personal data are not to be the subject of further processing which is incompatible with those purposes, it should be pointed out, on the one hand, that the recording and storage, by the controller, in a newly created database, of personal data stored in another database constitutes \u2018further processing\u2019 of those data.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concept of \u2018processing\u2019 is defined broadly in Article\u00a04(2) of Regulation 2016/679 as covering any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as, inter alia, the collection, recording and storage of those data.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, in accordance with the usual meaning of the term \u2018further\u2019 in everyday language, any processing of personal data which is subsequent to the initial processing constituted by the initial collection of those data constitutes \u2018further\u2019 processing of those data, regardless of the purpose of that further processing.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, it should be pointed out that Article\u00a05(1)(b) of Regulation 2016/679 does not contain any indication of the circumstances in which further processing of personal data may be regarded as compatible with the purposes of the initial collection of those data.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The context of that provision nevertheless provides, in the second place, useful clarification in that regard.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from a combined reading of Article\u00a05(1)(b), Article\u00a06(1)(a) and Article\u00a06(4) of Regulation 2016/679 that the question of the compatibility of the further processing of personal data with the purposes for which those data were initially collected arises only if the purposes of that further processing are not identical to the purposes of the initial collection.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it follows from that Article\u00a06(4), read in the light of recital\u00a050 of that regulation, that, where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the data have been collected is not based on the data subject\u2019s consent or on an EU or Member State law, it is necessary, in order to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, to take into account, inter alia, first, any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended further processing; secondly, the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller; thirdly, the nature of the personal data; fourthly, the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects; and finally, fifthly, the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing operations.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General noted, in essence, in points\u00a028, 59 and 60 of his Opinion, those criteria reflect the need for a specific, logical and sufficiently close link between the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected and the further processing of those data, and ensure that such further processing does not deviate from the legitimate expectations of the subscribers as to the subsequent use of their data.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in the third place, as the Advocate General emphasised, in essence, in point\u00a027 of his Opinion, those criteria limit the reuse of personal data previously collected by ensuring a balance between, on the one hand, the need for predictability and legal certainty regarding the purposes of the processing of personal data previously collected and, on the other hand, the recognition of a degree of flexibility for the controller in the management of those data, and thereby contribute to the attainment of the objective of ensuring a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons, which is set out in recital\u00a010 of Regulation 2016/679.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, taking into account the criteria mentioned in paragraph\u00a035 of the present judgment and in the light of all of the circumstances characterising the case, it falls to the national court to determine both the purposes of the initial collection of the personal data and those of the further processing of those data and, if the purposes of that further processing are different from the purposes of that collection, to check that the further processing of those data is compatible with the purposes of that initial collection.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, it is open to the Court, when giving a preliminary ruling on a reference, to give clarifications to guide the national court in that determination (see, to that effect, judgment of 7\u00a0April 2022, \nFuhrmann-2\n, C-249/21, EU:C:2022:269, paragraph\u00a032).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, first, as was recalled in paragraph\u00a013 of the present judgment, it is apparent from the order for reference that the personal data were initially collected by Digi, the controller, for the purposes of the conclusion and performance of subscription contracts with its private customers.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the parties to the main proceedings are not in agreement on the specific purpose of the recording and storage by Digi, in the test database, of the personal data at issue. While Digi argues that the specific purpose of the creation of the test database was to guarantee access to the subscribers\u2019 data until the errors were corrected, with the result that that purpose was identical to the purposes pursued by the initial collection of those data, the Authority maintains that the specific purpose of the further processing was distinct from those purposes since it was the conducting of tests and the correction of errors.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that it is apparent from the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a019 of the present judgment that, in proceedings under Article\u00a0267 TFEU, which are based on a clear separation of functions between the national courts and the Court, the national court alone has jurisdiction to interpret and apply national law, while the Court is empowered only to give rulings on the interpretation or the validity of an EU provision on the basis of the facts which the national court puts before it.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the order for reference that the test database was created by Digi in order to be able to carry out tests and correct errors, so that it is in the light of those purposes that it falls to the referring court to assess the compatibility of the further processing with the purposes of the initial collection, being the conclusion and performance of subscription contracts.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, regarding that assessment, it should be pointed out that there is a specific link between the conducting of tests and the correction of errors affecting the subscriber database and the performance of the subscription contracts of private customers, in that such errors may be prejudicial to the provision of the contractually agreed service, for which the data were initially collected. As the Advocate General noted in point\u00a060 of his Opinion, such processing does not deviate from the legitimate expectations of those customers as to the subsequent use of their personal data. It is not, furthermore, apparent from the order for reference that those data were sensitive in whole or in part or that the further processing at issue of those data, as such, had detrimental consequences for the subscribers or was not accompanied by appropriate safeguards, which it is, in any event, for the referring court to verify.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a05(1)(b) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the principle of \u2018purpose limitation\u2019, laid down in that provision, does not preclude the recording and storage by the controller, in a database created for the purposes of carrying out tests and correcting errors, of personal data previously collected and stored in another database, where such further processing is compatible with the specific purposes for which the personal data were initially collected, which must be determined in the light of the criteria in Article\u00a06(4) of that regulation.\n\u00a0\nSecond question\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of a preliminary point, it should be noted that the referring court\u2019s second question, which relates to the conformity with the principle of \u2018storage limitation\u2019, appearing in Article\u00a05(1)(e) of Regulation 2016/679, of the storage by Digi, in the test database, of personal data of its customers, is asked by that court only in the event of the answer to the first question, as reformulated, being in the affirmative, namely if that storage is not compatible with the principle of \u2018purpose limitation\u2019, laid down in Article\u00a05(1)(b) of that regulation.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, first, as the Advocate General noted in point\u00a024 of his Opinion, the principles relating to the processing of personal data set out in Article\u00a05 of Regulation 2016/679 apply cumulatively. Consequently, the storage of personal data must comply not only with the principle of \u2018purpose limitation\u2019, but also with that of \u2018storage limitation\u2019.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, it should be recalled that, as is apparent from recital\u00a010 of Regulation 2016/679, that regulation aims, inter alia, to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union and, to that end, to ensure consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of those persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, Chapters II and III of that regulation set out, respectively, the principles governing the processing of personal data and the rights of the data subject, which any processing of personal data must observe. In particular, any processing of personal data must, first, comply with the principles relating to the processing of data established in Article\u00a05 of that regulation and, second, in the light, in particular, of the principle of the lawfulness of processing, laid down in Article\u00a05(1)(a), satisfy one of the conditions of the lawfulness of the processing listed in Article\u00a06 of that regulation (see, to that effect, judgments of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (\nPenalty points\n)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a096, and of 24\u00a0February 2022, \nValsts ie\u0146\u0113mumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)\n, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraph\u00a050).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of those considerations, even if, formally, the referring court asked the second question only in the event of the answer to the first question, as reformulated, being in the affirmative, that does not prevent the Court from providing the referring court with all the elements of interpretation of EU law which may be of assistance in assessing the case pending before it (see, to that effect, judgment of 17\u00a0March 2022, \nDaimler\n, C-232/20, EU:C:2022:196, paragraph\u00a049) and, therefore, from answering the second question.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it must be found that, by that question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a05(1)(e) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the principle of \u2018storage limitation\u2019, laid down in that provision, precludes the storage by the controller, in a database created for the purposes of carrying out tests and correcting errors, of personal data previously collected for other purposes, for longer than is necessary for the conducting of those tests and the correction of those errors.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it should be pointed out that, under Article\u00a05(1)(e) of Regulation 2016/679, personal data are to be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is thus unequivocally clear from the wording of that article that the principle of \u2018storage limitation\u2019 requires the controller to be able to demonstrate, in accordance with the principle of accountability referred to in paragraph\u00a024 of the present judgment, that personal data are kept only for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or for which they have been further processed.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that even initially lawful processing of data may over time become incompatible with Regulation 2016/679 where those data are no longer necessary for such purposes (judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a074) and that the data must be erased when those purposes have been served (see, to that effect, judgment of 7\u00a0May 2009, \nRijkeboer\n, C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293, paragraph\u00a033).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is consistent, in the second place, with the context of Article\u00a05(1)(e) of Regulation 2016/679.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it was recalled in paragraph\u00a049 of the present judgment that any processing of personal data must comply with the principles relating to the processing of data set out in Article\u00a05 of that regulation and satisfy one of the conditions relating to the lawfulness of the processing listed in Article\u00a06 of that regulation.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, as is apparent from such Article\u00a06, where the data subject has not given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes, in accordance with Article\u00a06(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, the processing must, as is apparent from Article\u00a06(1)(b) to (f), satisfy a requirement of necessity.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, such a requirement of necessity follows also from the principle of \u2018data minimisation\u2019, laid down in Article\u00a05(1)(c) of that regulation, under which personal data are to be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such an interpretation is, in the third place, consistent with the objective pursued by Article\u00a05(1)(e) of Regulation 2016/679, which, as was recalled in paragraph\u00a048 of the present judgment, is, inter alia, to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union with regard to the processing of personal data.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, Digi argued that it was due to an oversight that the personal data of a portion of its private customers stored in the test database were not deleted after the tests had been conducted and the errors had been corrected.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is sufficient to point out that that argument is not relevant for the purposes of assessing whether data were kept for longer than was necessary for the purposes for which they were further processed, in breach of the principle of \u2018storage limitation\u2019, laid down in Article\u00a05(1)(e) of Regulation 2016/679.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a05(1)(e) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the principle of \u2018storage limitation\u2019, laid down in that provision, precludes the storage by the controller, in a database created for the purposes of carrying out tests and correcting errors, of personal data previously collected for other purposes, for longer than is necessary for the conducting of those tests and the correction of those errors.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a05(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation),\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the principle of \u2018purpose limitation\u2019, laid down in that provision, does not preclude the recording and storage by the controller, in a database created for the purposes of carrying out tests and correcting errors, of personal data previously collected and stored in another database, where such further processing is compatible with the specific purposes for which the personal data were initially collected, which must be determined in the light of the criteria in Article\u00a06(4) of that regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a05(1)(e) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the principle of \u2018storage limitation\u2019, laid down in that provision, precludes the storage by the controller, in a database created for the purposes of carrying out tests and correcting errors, of personal data previously collected for other purposes, for longer than is necessary for the conducting of those tests and the correction of those errors."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The second sentence of subparagraph\u00a02 of Paragraph\u00a0630g of the BGB provides that the patient must reimburse the person providing treatment for the costs incurred.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DW received dental care from FT. Suspecting that errors had been made in the treatment he had been given, DW requested that FT provide, free of charge, a first copy of his medical records. FT informed DW that she would not grant his request unless he agreed to cover the costs connected with providing a copy of the medical records, as is provided for in national law.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DW brought an action against FT. Both at first instance and on appeal, DW\u2019s request to be provided with a first copy of his medical records free of charge was upheld. Those decisions were based on an interpretation of the applicable national legislation in the light of Article\u00a012(5) of the GDPR, as well as Article\u00a015(1) and (3) thereof.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing an appeal on a point of law (\nRevision\n) brought by FT, the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice, Germany) considers that the outcome of the dispute is dependent on the interpretation to be given in respect of the provisions of the GDPR.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court notes that, under national law, the patient may obtain a copy of his or her medical records, provided that he or she reimburses the person providing treatment for the costs resulting therefrom.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it could be inferred from the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with the first sentence of Article\u00a012(5) thereof, that the controller\u00a0\u2013 in this instance, the person providing treatment\u00a0\u2013 is required to provide the patient with a first copy of his or her medical records free of charge.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the referring court notes that DW is requesting a first copy of his medical records with a view to triggering the liability of FT. Such a purpose is not related to that referred to in recital\u00a063 of the GDPR, which provides for the right to access personal data in order to become aware of the processing of those data and verify the lawfulness of that processing. However, the wording of Article\u00a015 of that regulation does not make exercise of the right to communication subject to the existence of such grounds. In addition, that provision does not require the data subject to provide reasons for his or her request for communication.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, the referring court emphasises that Article\u00a023(1) of the GDPR permits the adoption of national legislative measures restricting the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Articles\u00a012 to 22 of that regulation in order to safeguard one of the objectives referred to in that provision. In this instance, FT is relying on the objective of protecting the rights and freedoms of others which is set out in Article\u00a023(1)(i) of the GDPR and argues that the charging system introduced by the second sentence of subparagraph\u00a02 of Paragraph\u00a0630g of the BGB is a measure which (i) is necessary and proportionate to safeguard the legitimate interests of persons providing treatment and (ii) as a general rule, contributes to preventing requests for copies by the patients concerned which do not contain a statement of reasons.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the second sentence of subparagraph\u00a02 of Paragraph\u00a0630g of the BGB was adopted prior to the entry into force of the GDPR.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the charging system introduced by the second sentence of subparagraph\u00a02 of Paragraph\u00a0630g of the BGB is primarily intended to protect the economic interests of persons providing treatment. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the interest of those persons in being relieved of the costs and charges connected with providing copies of data is included in the rights and freedoms of others for the purposes of Article\u00a023(1)(i) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the systematic transfer to patients of the costs connected with copies of their medical records could appear excessive, given that it does not take account either of the amount of costs actually incurred or of the circumstances specific to each request.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, in so far as DW is requesting that a copy of all the medical documents concerning him, and thus of all his medical records, be provided, the referring court questions the scope of the right to obtain a copy of personal data undergoing processing, as enshrined in Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR. In that regard, that right could be complied with through the communication of a summary of the data processed by the medical professional. However, it appears that the objectives of transparency and verifying lawfulness pursued by the GDPR argue in favour of communicating a copy of all the data available to the controller in their original form, namely all the medical documents concerning the patient inasmuch as they contain such data.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of [the GDPR], read in conjunction with Article\u00a012(5) thereof, be interpreted as meaning that the controller (in the present case: the doctor providing treatment) is not obliged to provide the data subject (in the present case: the patient), free of charge, with a first copy of his or her personal data processed by the controller where the data subject does not request the copy in order to pursue the purposes referred to in the first sentence of recital\u00a063 of the GDPR, namely to become aware of the processing of his or her personal data and to be able to verify the lawfulness of that processing, but pursues a different purpose\u00a0\u2013 one which is not related to data protection but is legitimate (in the present case: to verify the existence of claims under medical liability law)?\n(2)(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question\u00a01 is answered in the negative: In accordance with Article\u00a023(1)(i) of the GDPR, can a national provision of a Member State adopted prior to the entry into force of the GDPR also be regarded as a restriction of the right to be provided, free of charge, with a copy of the personal data processed by the controller, as provided for in the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article\u00a012(5) thereof?\n(2)(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question\u00a02(a) is answered in the affirmative: Must Article\u00a023(1)(i) of the GDPR be interpreted as meaning that the rights and freedoms of others, as referred to therein, also include their interest in being relieved of the costs associated with the provision of a copy of data in accordance with the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR and other expenses incurred in making the copy available?\n(2)(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question\u00a02(b) is answered in the affirmative: In accordance with Article\u00a023(1)(i) of the GDPR, can national legislation which, in the context of the doctor-patient relationship, provides that the doctor always has a claim for reimbursement of expenses against the patient, irrespective of the specific circumstances of the individual case, where the doctor provides the patient with a copy of the patient\u2019s personal data from the patient\u2019s medical records be regarded as a restriction of the obligations and rights arising from the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article\u00a012(5) thereof?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question\u00a01 is answered in the negative and [Question\u00a02(a), (b) or (c)] is answered in the negative: In the context of the doctor-patient relationship, does the entitlement under the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR include entitlement to be provided with copies of all parts of the patient\u2019s medical records containing the patient\u2019s personal data, or does it extend only to the provision of a copy of the patient\u2019s personal data as such, with the doctor who processes the data deciding the manner in which he or she compiles the data for the patient concerned?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a012(5) and Article\u00a015(1) and (3) of the GDPR are to be interpreted as meaning that the controller is under an obligation to provide the data subject, free of charge, with a first copy of his or her personal data undergoing processing, even where the reason for that request is not related to those referred to in the first sentence of recital\u00a063 of that regulation.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with settled case-law, in order to interpret a provision of EU law it is necessary to take account not only of the wording of that provision, but also of its context and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it forms part (judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Information regarding the recipients of personal data)\n, C-154/21, EU:C:2023:3, paragraph\u00a029).\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding, first, the wording of the relevant provisions, it should be noted that Article\u00a012(5) of the GDPR establishes the principle that the exercise of the data subject\u2019s right of access to his or her data undergoing processing and to the information relating thereto is not to entail any cost for the data subject. Furthermore, that provision envisages two reasons why a controller may either charge a reasonable fee taking into account administrative costs or refuse to act on a request. Those reasons relate to instances of abuses of rights, in which the data subject\u2019s requests are \u2018manifestly unfounded\u2019 or \u2018excessive\u2019, in particular because of their repetitive character.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring court has expressly stated that the data subject\u2019s request was not abusive.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the data subject\u2019s right of access to his or her data undergoing processing and to the information relating thereto, which is an integral part of the right to the protection of personal data, is guaranteed in Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR. According to the wording of that provision, data subjects have the right to access their personal data undergoing processing.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it is apparent from Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR that the controller is to provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing and that it may charge a reasonable fee for any further copies requested by the data subject. In that regard, Article\u00a015(4) of that regulation specifies that Article\u00a015(3) thereof confers a \u2018right\u2019 on that data subject. Such a fee may therefore be charged by the controller only where the data subject has already received, free of charge, a first copy of his or her data and is once again requesting a copy of those data.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As has already been held by the Court, it follows from the literal analysis of the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR that that provision confers on the data subject the right to obtain a faithful reproduction of his or her personal data, understood in a broad sense, that are subject to operations that can be classified as \u2018processing carried out by the controller\u2019 (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a028).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it follows from a combined reading of Article\u00a012(5) of the GDPR and Article\u00a015(1) and (3) thereof that (i) the data subject has the right to obtain a first copy, free of charge, of his or her personal data undergoing processing and (ii) the controller is given the option, under certain conditions, to charge a reasonable fee taking administrative costs into account or to refuse to act on a request if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this instance, it should be noted that a medical practitioner carrying out the processing operations referred to in Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR concerning his or her patients\u2019 data must be regarded as being a \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of that regulation who is subject to the obligations which that status entails, in particular guaranteeing access to personal data at the request of data subjects.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be pointed out that neither the wording of Article\u00a012(5) of the GDPR nor that of Article\u00a015(1) and (3) thereof make the provision, free of charge, of a first copy of personal data conditional upon data subjects putting forward reasons to justify their requests. Therefore, those provisions do not give the controller the possibility of demanding that reasons be given for the request for access submitted by the data subject.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding, secondly, the context in which the provisions referred to above occur, it should be emphasised that Article\u00a012 of the GDPR forms part of Section\u00a01 of Chapter\u00a0III of that regulation, which concerns, inter alia, the principle of transparency, set out in Article\u00a05(1)(a) thereof.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a012 of the GDPR thus sets out the general obligations incumbent on the controller as regards the transparency of information and communications, as well as the rules governing the exercise of the rights of the data subject.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a015 of the GDPR, which forms part of Section\u00a02 of Chapter\u00a0III thereof, concerning information and access to personal data, complements the framework of transparency of that regulation by granting the data subject a right of access to his or her personal data and a right to information regarding the processing of those data.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that, in accordance with recital\u00a059 of the GDPR, \u2018modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject\u2019s rights under this Regulation, including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object\u2019.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given that, as can be seen from paragraph\u00a038 of the present judgment, the data subject is not required to state the reasons for the request for access to data, the first sentence of recital\u00a063 of the GDPR cannot be interpreted as meaning that that request must be rejected if it concerns an objective other than that of becoming aware of the processing of data and verifying the lawfulness of that processing. That recital cannot restrict the scope of Article\u00a015(3) of that regulation as recalled in paragraph\u00a035 of the present judgment.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that it follows from settled case-law that the preamble to an act of EU law has no binding legal force and cannot be relied on either as a ground for derogating from the actual provisions of the act in question or for interpreting those provisions in a manner that is clearly contrary to their wording (judgment of 13\u00a0September 2018, \n\u010cesk\u00e1 poji\u0161\u0165ovna\n, C-287/17, EU:C:2018:707, paragraph\u00a033).\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the second sentence of recital\u00a063 of the GDPR states that the right which data subjects are recognised as having to access personal data includes, as regards data relating to their health, \u2018the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses, examination results, assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or interventions provided\u2019.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the right to access data relating to health guaranteed in Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR cannot be restricted, either by refusing to grant access or by requiring the payment of consideration, to one of the reasons referred to in the first sentence of recital\u00a063 thereof. The same applies as regards the right to obtain a first copy free of charge as provided for in Article\u00a012(5) and Article\u00a015(3) of that regulation.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, regarding the objectives pursued by the GDPR, it should be noted that the purpose of that regulation, as indicated by recitals\u00a010 and 11 thereof, is to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons within the Union, as well as to strengthen and set out in detail the rights of data subjects.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is precisely in order to achieve that objective that Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR guarantees the data subject a right to access his or her personal data (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2023, \nPankki S\n, C-579/21, EU:C:2023:501, paragraph\u00a057 and the case-law cited).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, Article\u00a012(5) and Article\u00a015(1) and (3) of the GDPR form part of the provisions intended to guarantee that right of access as well as the transparency, vis-\u00e0-vis the data subject, of the manner in which personal data are processed (see, to that effect, judgment of 12\u00a0January 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Information regarding the recipients of personal data)\n, C-154/21, EU:C:2023:3, paragraph\u00a042).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principle that the first copy of the data should be free of charge and the lack of a need to rely on a specific reason to justify the request for access necessarily contribute to facilitating the exercise, by the data subject, of the rights conferred on him or her by the GDPR.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, given the importance which the GDPR ascribes to the right to access personal data undergoing processing, as guaranteed in Article\u00a015(1) thereof, for achieving such objectives, the exercise of that right cannot be made subject to conditions which have not been expressly laid down by the EU legislature, such as the obligation to rely on one of the reasons referred to in the first sentence of recital\u00a063 of that regulation.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all of the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a012(5) and Article\u00a015(1) and (3) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the controller is under an obligation to provide the data subject, free of charge, with a first copy of his or her personal data undergoing processing, even where the reason for that request is not related to those referred to in the first sentence of recital\u00a063 of that regulation.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a023(1)(i) of the GDPR is to be interpreted as permitting a piece of national legislation, adopted prior to the entry into force of that regulation, which, with a view to protecting the economic interests of the controller, makes the data subject bear the costs of a first copy of his or her personal data undergoing processing.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, regarding the question whether only national measures adopted after the entry into force of the GDPR are capable of falling within the scope of Article\u00a023(1) thereof, it should be emphasised that the wording of that provision contains no indication in that regard.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, Article\u00a023(1) of the GDPR merely indicates that a legislative measure of a Member State may restrict the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Articles\u00a012 to 22 of that regulation in so far as that measure corresponds to the rights and obligations provided for in those articles and when such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure to safeguard, inter alia, the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, Article\u00a023(1) of the GDPR does not exclude from its scope national legislative measures adopted prior to the entry into force of that regulation in so far as those measures satisfy the conditions laid down in that provision.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, regarding the question whether a piece of national legislation which, with a view to protecting the economic interests of persons providing treatment, makes the patient bear the costs connected with the provision of a first copy of the medical records requested by that patient, is covered by Article\u00a023(1)(i) of the GDPR, it should be borne in mind, first, that, as is apparent from paragraphs\u00a031 and 33 to 36 of the present judgment, under Article\u00a012(5) and Article\u00a015(1) and (3) of that regulation, the data subject is recognised as having a right to obtain a first copy, free of charge, of his or her personal data undergoing processing.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the second sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR authorises the controller to charge a reasonable fee, based on administrative costs, for any further copies. Furthermore, Article\u00a012(5) of that regulation, read in the light of Article\u00a015(1) and (3) thereof, permits the controller to protect itself against abuse of the right of access by charging a reasonable fee in the case of a manifestly unfounded or excessive request.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, pursuant to recital\u00a04 of that regulation, the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right and must be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Thus, the GDPR respects all the fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as enshrined by the Treaties (judgment of 24\u00a0February 2022, \nValsts ie\u0146\u0113mumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)\n, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraph\u00a053).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, Article\u00a015(4) of the GDPR provides that \u2018the right to obtain a copy\u00a0\u2026 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others\u2019.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, Article\u00a023(1)(i) of that regulation recalls that a restriction of the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in, inter alia, Article\u00a015 thereof is possible \u2018when such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard\u00a0\u2026 the protection of\u00a0\u2026 the rights and freedoms of others\u2019.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, it follows from paragraphs\u00a059 to 61 of the present judgment that the right which the data subject is recognised as having to obtain a first copy, free of charge, of his or her personal data undergoing processing is not absolute.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, only considerations relating to, inter alia, the protection of the rights and freedoms of others would be such as to justify a restriction of that right, in so far as such a restriction respects the essence thereof and is a necessary and proportionate measure to safeguard that protection, as provided for in Article\u00a023(1)(i) of the GDPR.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from the order for reference, the charging system provided for in the second sentence of subparagraph\u00a02 of Paragraph\u00a0630g of the BGB permits the person providing treatment to make the patient bear the costs connected with the provision of a first copy of his or her medical records. The referring court emphasises that that system is intended, primarily, to protect the economic interests of persons providing treatment, which deters patients from making needless requests for copies of their medical records. Thus, in so far as the essential objective of the piece of national legislation at issue in the main proceedings is to protect the economic interests of persons providing treatment, which it is for the referring court to ascertain, such considerations cannot be included in the \u2018rights and freedoms of others\u2019 referred to in Article\u00a023(1)(i) of the GDPR.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, such a piece of legislation deters not only needless requests, but also requests seeking to obtain, for a legitimate reason, a first copy, free of charge, of processed personal data. Consequently, it is necessarily in breach of the principle that the first copy should be free of charge and thereby undermines the effectiveness of the right of access provided for in Article\u00a015(1) of the GDPR, as well as, as a result, the protection guaranteed by that regulation.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, it is not apparent from the order for reference that the interests protected by that piece of national legislation go beyond considerations of a purely administrative or economic nature.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be emphasised that the economic interests of controllers were taken into account by the EU legislature under Article\u00a012(5) and the second sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, which, as has been recalled in paragraph\u00a058 of the present judgment, define the circumstances in which the controller may charge a fee connected with the provision of a copy of personal data undergoing processing.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the pursuit of the objective connected with the protection of the economic interests of persons providing treatment cannot justify a measure leading to the undermining of the right to obtain, free of charge, a first copy and, as a result, of the effectiveness of the data subject\u2019s right of access to his or her personal data undergoing processing.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all of the foregoing, the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a023(1)(i) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that a piece of national legislation adopted prior to the entry into force of that regulation is capable of falling within the scope of that provision. However, such a possibility does not permit the adoption of a piece of national legislation which, with a view to protecting the economic interests of the controller, makes the data subject bear the costs of a first copy of his or her personal data undergoing processing.\n\u00a0\nThe third question\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR is to be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of a doctor-patient relationship, the right to obtain a copy of personal data undergoing processing means the data subject is to be provided with a full copy of the documents included in his or her medical records and containing his or her personal data, or solely with a copy of those data as such.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, the Court has held that, according to its wording, the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR confers on the data subject the right to obtain a faithful reproduction of his or her personal data, understood in a broad sense, that are subject to operations that can be classified as \u2018processing\u2019 carried out by the controller (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a028).\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR cannot be interpreted as establishing a separate right from that provided for in Article\u00a015(1) thereof. Furthermore, the term \u2018copy\u2019 does not relate to a document as such, but to the personal data which it contains and which must be complete. The copy must therefore contain all the personal data undergoing processing (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a032).\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, regarding the objectives pursued by Article\u00a015 of the GDPR, the purpose of that regulation is to strengthen and set out in detail the rights of data subjects. Thus, the right of access provided for in that provision must enable the data subject to ensure that the personal data relating to him or her are correct and that they are processed in a lawful manner. Furthermore, the copy of the personal data undergoing processing, which the controller must provide pursuant to the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR, must have all the characteristics necessary for the data subject effectively to exercise his or her rights under that regulation and must, consequently, reproduce those data fully and faithfully (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraphs\u00a033, 34 and 39).\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, in order to ensure that the information provided by the controller is easy to understand, as is required by Article\u00a012(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital\u00a058 of that regulation, the reproduction of extracts from documents or even of entire documents which contain, inter alia, the personal data undergoing processing may prove to be essential where the contextualisation of the data processed is necessary in order to ensure the data are intelligible (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a041).\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the right to obtain from the controller a copy of the personal data undergoing processing means that the data subject must be given a faithful and intelligible reproduction of all those data. That right entails the right to obtain copies of extracts from documents or even of entire documents which contain, inter alia, those data, if the provision of such a copy is essential in order to enable the data subject to exercise effectively the rights conferred on him or her by that regulation (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF\n, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph\u00a045).\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the information at issue in the case in the main proceedings, it should be noted that the GDPR identifies the material of which the applicant at first instance in the main proceedings should be able to request a copy. Thus, as regards personal data relating to health, recital\u00a063 of that regulation specifies that the right of access of data subjects includes \u2018the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses, examination results, assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or interventions provided\u2019.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as was noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in points\u00a078 to 80 of his Opinion, it is because of the sensitive nature of personal data relating to the health of natural persons that the EU legislature thus highlighted the importance of ensuring that those persons are given access to the data contained in their medical records as fully and precisely as possible, but also in a form which is intelligible.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding examination results, assessments by treating physicians and treatments or interventions provided to a patient, which, as a general rule, involve a large amount of technical data, or even images, the provision of a simple summary or a compilation of those data by the medical practitioner, in order to present them in an aggregated form, could create the risk of some relevant data being omitted or incorrectly reproduced, or, in any event, of it being made harder for the patient to verify how accurate and exhaustive those data are and to understand those data.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all of the foregoing, the answer to the third question is that the first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of a doctor-patient relationship, the right to obtain a copy of personal data undergoing processing means that the data subject must be given a faithful and intelligible reproduction of all those data. That right entails the right to obtain a full copy of the documents included in his or her medical records and containing, inter alia, those data if the provision of such a copy is essential in order to enable the data subject to verify how accurate and exhaustive those data are, as well as to ensure they are intelligible. Regarding data relating to the health of the data subject, that right includes in any event the right to obtain a copy of the data in his or her medical records containing information such as diagnoses, examination results, assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or interventions provided to him or her.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a012(5) and Article\u00a015(1) and (3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation),\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the controller is under an obligation to provide the data subject, free of charge, with a first copy of his or her personal data undergoing processing, even where the reason for that request is not related to those referred to in the first sentence of recital\u00a063 of that regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a023(1)(i) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that a piece of national legislation adopted prior to the entry into force of that regulation is capable of falling within the scope of that provision. However, such a possibility does not permit the adoption of a piece of national legislation which, with a view to protecting the economic interests of the controller, makes the data subject bear the costs of a first copy of his or her personal data undergoing processing.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe first sentence of Article\u00a015(3) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of a doctor-patient relationship, the right to obtain a copy of personal data undergoing processing means that the data subject must be given a faithful and intelligible reproduction of all those data.

Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 9 Jul 2020, C-272/19 (\nLand Hessen\n)\nGeneral data protection law \n >

If so, VQ could claim a right of access under Article\u00a015 of that regulation.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulation 2016/679 does not, however, provide any definition of the concept of \u2018public authority\u2019. In the view of the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden), that expression can be understood in a functional sense or in an institutional sense. Taking the first sense, \u2018public authorities\u2019 comprise all public bodies that carry out public administrative tasks, including, consequently, the Parliament of \nLand\n Hessen when it carries out such tasks. Taking the second sense, the Petitions Committee of that parliament is an independent body, and therefore a public authority, in the institutional sense. It does not take part in the legislative activity of that parliament given that, first, its activity has no binding effect and, second, it has no right to initiate legislation and no right to enact regulations, its actions always being dependent on a citizen\u2019s petition being submitted and the content of the petition.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, since Article\u00a02(2) of Regulation 2016/679 does not exclude bodies or institutions acting in a judicial or legislative capacity, that provision implies that the concept of public services and therefore the concept of a public authority should be construed broadly. Accordingly, from the perspective of the right to submit a petition, there is nothing to distinguish that committee from any other administrative authority of \nLand\n Hessen.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden) considers, consequently, that the Petitions Committee of the Parliament of \nLand\n Hessen is a \u2018public authority\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of that regulation and that there is no reason, in this case, to exclude a right of access under Article\u00a015 of that regulation.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, that court is uncertain, in the second place, whether it itself can be considered to be a \u2018court or tribunal\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a0267 TFEU, read together with the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, in the light of the criteria set out by the Court in that regard, in particular the criterion pertaining to the independence of the body concerned.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring body states that that the requirement of independence has two aspects. The first aspect, which is external, assumes that the body concerned exercises its functions wholly autonomously, without being subordinated to any other body and without taking orders or instructions from any source whatsoever, and is thus protected against external interventions or pressure liable to jeopardise the independent judgment of its members as regards proceedings before them. The second aspect, which is internal in nature, is linked to the concept of impartiality and seeks to ensure that an equal distance is maintained from the parties to the proceedings and their respective interests with regard to the subject matter of those proceedings. That aspect requires objectivity and the absence of any interest in the outcome of the proceedings apart from the strict application of the rule of law.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the external aspect of independence, the connection of a court or tribunal to the Ministry of Justice means that that court or tribunal cannot function wholly autonomously. In this case, the organisation of the courts or tribunals in \nLand\n Hessen is determined by the Ministry of Justice of that \nLand\n. In particular, that ministry determines the means of communication (telephone, fax, Internet and so forth) and the IT facilities, notably the \u2018HessenPC\u2019, designed for the public services, with a central service provider, the Hessische Zentrale f\u00fcr Datenverarbeitung (\nLand\n Hessen Centre for the data processing), which is part of the Ministry for Finance of \nLand\n Hessen. The latter ensures also the maintenance of all those facilities, so that the administrative authority has the possibility of obtaining access to all the data of the courts or tribunals.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mere risk of political influence being applied to the courts or tribunals, by means of, inter alia, the facilities or staff allocated by the Ministry of Justice, is sufficient to create a risk of interference in their decisions and to affect the independence of the court or tribunals in the performance of their tasks. It would be sufficient for that purpose if there was an imagined pressure to achieve rapid settlement of cases using a workload statistic managed by that ministry.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, the courts or tribunals of \nLand\n Hessen have no independent control in the area of data protection, since the bulk of the processing of data is prescribed, in essence, by the Ministry of Justice of \nLand\n Hessen, with no supervision by the courts as mentioned in recital\u00a020 of Regulation 2016/679.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the internal aspect of independence, the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden) states that German constitutional law does not guarantee the institutional independence of the courts or tribunals.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, as is clear from Paragraphs\u00a02b and 3 of the HRiG, the appointment, appraisal and promotion of judges, including those who are members of the referring court, are matters for the Minister of Justice of \nLand\n Hessen. It follows that the provisions of public service law are applicable to them, so that, inter alia, decisions on work-related travel abroad of judges, such as that undertaken as part of the European Judicial Training Network, have to be made by that minister.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, in accordance with Paragraph\u00a018 of the code of administrative procedure, in order to meet a temporary need for staff, a public official can be appointed as a temporary judge. Such a judge could come from a public authority which is the defendant in judicial proceedings brought before him or her.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the Ministry of Justice of \nLand\n Hessen records the professional contact details of all the judges in a human resources information management system which is the responsibility of the government of \nLand \n Hessen, so that all the administrative authorities of that \nLand \n can obtain access to that data, even when they may be a party in a case brought before those judges.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last, the Ministry of Justice also decides on the number of judges and number of posts at each court or tribunal, on the \u2018non-judicial\u2019 staff assigned, in fact, to the executive, and on the extent of the IT facilities of each court or tribunal.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the court or tribunals have merely a functional independence in so far as the judges alone are independent and subject to the law, in accordance with Paragraph\u00a0126 of the Constitution of \nLand\n Hessen. However, by itself, that functional independence is insufficient to protect the court or tribunals from any external influence.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The conclusion of the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden) is that, probably, it does not satisfy the conditions laid down in the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter governing whether it can be regarded as an independent and impartial tribunal.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is [Regulation 2016/679], in particular [its] Article\u00a015, [headed \u201cRight of access by the data subject\u201d], applicable to the committee of a parliament of a Federated State of a Member State that is responsible for dealing with the petitions of citizens\u00a0\u2014 in this case the Petitions Committee of the Parliament of \nLand\n Hessen\u00a0\u2014 and is that committee to be regarded in that connection as a public authority within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of Regulation 2016/679?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the referring court an independent and impartial court or tribunal within the meaning of Article\u00a0267 TFEU read in conjunction with the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of [the Charter]?\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe jurisdiction of the Court\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its observations, the Polish Government calls into question the jurisdiction of the Court, in particular its jurisdiction to give a ruling on the second question, given that EU law does not regulate the judicial organisation of the Member States and that, consequently, that question falls solely within the scope of national law.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suffice it to state, in that regard, that the request for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of EU law, whether of Regulation 2016/679 or of Article\u00a0267 TFEU, read together with Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Court plainly has jurisdiction to give a ruling on that request in its entirety, that is, on both the first and the second question (see, to that effect, judgment of 19\u00a0November 2019, \nA.\u00a0K. and Others (Independence of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court)\n, C-585/18, C-624/18 and C-625/18, EU:C:2019:982, paragraphs\u00a074 and 75).\n\u00a0\nThe admissibility of the request for a preliminary ruling\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden) expresses doubt as to its own status as a \u2018court or tribunal\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a0267 TFEU, read in the light of Article\u00a047 of the Charter. Accordingly, it is in fact inviting the Court to examine the admissibility of its request for a preliminary ruling, given that being a \u2018court or tribunal\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a0267, is a condition of that admissibility and, consequently, a prerequisite of the interpretation by the Court of the provision of EU law specified in the first question.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with settled case-law, in order to determine whether a body making a reference is a \u2018court or tribunal\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a0267 TFEU, which is a question governed by EU law alone, and therefore to determine whether the request for a preliminary ruling is admissible, the Court takes account of a number of factors, such as whether the body is established by law, whether it is permanent, whether its jurisdiction is compulsory, whether its procedure is \ninter partes\n, whether it applies rules of law and whether it is independent (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0January 2020, \nBanco de Santander\n, \n C-274/14, EU:C:2020:17, paragraph\u00a051 and the case-law cited).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doubts expressed by the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden) concern its own independence from the legislature or from the executive. Those doubts are based on the following circumstances: (i) the judges are appointed and promoted by the Minister of Justice; (ii) the appraisal of judges is undertaken by the Ministry of Justice according to the same rules as are applicable to public officials; (iii) the personal data and professional contact details of the judges are managed by that ministry, which thus has access to that data; (iv) to cover temporary staff requirements, public officials can be appointed as temporary judges; and (v) the Minister of Justice prescribes the external and internal organisation of the courts or tribunals, determines the allocation of staff, means of communication and IT facilities of the courts or tribunals and also decides on the work-related travel abroad undertaken by the judges.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be recalled that the independence of the judges of the Member States is of fundamental importance for the EU legal order in various respects. It is informed, first, by the principle of the rule of law, which is one of the values on which, under Article\u00a02 TEU, the Union is founded and which are common to the Member States, and by Article\u00a019 TEU, which gives concrete expression to that value and entrusts shared responsibility for ensuring judicial review within the EU legal order to national courts or tribunals (see, to that effect, judgment of 27\u00a0February 2018, \nAssocia\u00e7\u00e3o Sindical dos Ju\u00edzes Portugueses\n, C-64/16, EU:C:2018:117, paragraph\u00a032). Second, that independence is a necessary condition if individuals are to be guaranteed, within the scope of EU law, the fundamental right to an independent and impartial tribunal laid down in Article\u00a047 of the Charter, which is of cardinal importance as a guarantee of the protection of all the rights that individuals derive from EU law (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 26\u00a0March 2020, \nReview Simpson\n v \nCouncil\n and\n HG \nv \n Commission\n, C-542/18\u00a0RX-II and C-543/18\u00a0RX\u00a0II, EU:C:2020:232, paragraphs\u00a070 and 71 and the case-law cited). Last, that independence is essential to the proper working of the judicial cooperation system embodied by the preliminary ruling mechanism under Article\u00a0267 TFEU, in that that mechanism may be activated only by a body responsible for applying EU law, which satisfies, inter alia, that criterion of independence (see, in particular, judgment of 21\u00a0January 2020, \nBanco de Santander\n, \n C-274/14, EU:C:2020:17, paragraph\u00a056 and the case-law cited).\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, in order to determine the admissibility of a request for a preliminary ruling, the criterion relating to independence which the referring body must satisfy before it can be considered to be a \u2018court or tribunal\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a0267 TFEU, may be assessed solely in the light of that provision.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows, as stated by the European Commission, that, in this instance, that assessment must relate to the independence of the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden) solely in the context of the dispute in the main proceedings, which relates, as is stated in paragraphs\u00a022 to 25 of the present judgment, to the interpretation of EU law, namely Regulation 2016/679.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, some factors to which the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden) draws attention are plainly of no relevance for that assessment.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That must be said, in the first place, of the rules relating to the procedures for the appointment of temporary judges, since such judges are not members of the formation of the court, in this instance, which consists solely of the President of the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the second place, the role of the Ministry of Justice of \nLand\n Hessen with respect to the management of work-related travel of judges or the organisation of the court or tribunals, the determination of staff numbers, the management of means of communication and IT facilities, as well as the management of personal data, suffice it to state that the request for a preliminary ruling contains no information from which it can be ascertained to what extent those factors are liable to call into question, in the main proceedings, the independence of the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It remains, therefore, in essence, necessary to determine the alleged influence that the legislature or the executive are capable of exercising over judges who are members of that administrative court by reason of their involvement in the appointment, promotion and appraisal of those judges.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with settled case-law, the guarantees of the independence and impartiality of the courts and tribunals of the Member States require rules, particularly as regards the composition of the body and the appointment and length of service of its members, and as regards grounds for withdrawal by, challenges to, and dismissal of its members, in order to dispel any reasonable doubt in the minds of litigants as to the imperviousness of that body to external factors and its neutrality with respect to the interests before it (judgment of 21\u00a0January 2020, \nBanco de Santander\n, \n C-274/14, EU:C:2020:17, paragraph\u00a063 and the case-law cited).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the German Government states that, in this instance, the judiciary has an autonomous status within the public service, which is ensured, inter alia, by the guarantee of irremovability laid down in Paragraph\u00a097 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, by the fact that there exist civil service courts with jurisdiction over judges for the judicial protection of judges, and by the appointment procedure, in which the Judicial Appointments Committee plays a crucial role. That committee, provided for in Article\u00a0127 of the Constitution of \nLand\n Hessen, is composed of seven members designated by the parliament of that \nLand\n, five members of the judiciary and, by annual rotation, the President of one of the two Bar Associations of \nLand\n Hessen. The members designated by the parliament, in proportion to the composition of that institution, serve to ensure the democratic legitimacy of that committee.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the conditions governing the appointment of the judge sitting in the referring court, it must be recalled at the outset that the mere fact that the legislative authorities play a part in the process for appointing a judge does not give rise to a relationship of subordination to those authorities or to doubts as to the judge\u2019s impartiality, if, once appointed, he or she is not subject to any pressure and does not receive any instruction in performing the duties of his or her office (see, to that effect, judgment of 19\u00a0November 2019, \nA.\u00a0K. and Others (Independence of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court)\n, C-585/18, C-624/18 and C-625/18, EU:C:2019:982, paragraph\u00a0133 and the case-law cited).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden) appears, however, also to have doubts as to the compatibility of the composition of the Judicial Appointments Committee with the principle of independence, given that the majority of its members are chosen by the legislature.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, that fact cannot, in itself, give rise to any doubt as to the independence of the referring court. The assessment of the independence of a national court or tribunal must, including from the perspective of the conditions governing the appointment of its members, be made in the light of all the relevant factors.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be recalled, in that regard, that, where a national court or tribunal has submitted to the Court a number of factors which, in its view, call into question the independence of a committee involved in the appointment of judges, the Court has held that, although one or other of the factors indicated by that court or tribunal may be such as to escape criticism per se and may fall, in that case, within the competence of, and choices made by, the Member States, those factors, when taken together, in addition to the circumstances in which those choices were made, may, by contrast, throw doubt on the independence of a body involved in the procedure for the appointment of judges, despite the fact that, when those factors are taken individually, that conclusion is not inevitable (judgment of 19\u00a0November 2019, \nA.\u00a0K. and Others (Independence of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court)\n, C-585/18, C-624/18 and C-625/18, EU:C:2019:982, paragraph\u00a0142).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this instance, it cannot be concluded that a committee such as that at issue in the main proceedings is not independent solely because of the factor mentioned in paragraph\u00a055 of the present judgment.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the conditions governing the appraisal and promotion of judges, which are also called into question by the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden), suffice it to state that the documents submitted to the Court contain no indication as to how the manner in which the executive uses its powers in that regard are such as to engender legitimate doubts, particularly in the minds of litigants, concerning whether the judge concerned is impervious to external elements and whether he or she is impartial with respect to the opposing interests that may be brought before him or her.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the factors to which the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden) draws attention in support of the doubts that it expresses in relation to its own independence cannot, in themselves, be sufficient ground for a conclusion that those doubts are well-founded and that that court is not independent, notwithstanding all the other rules laid down by the legal order of which that administrative tribunal forms part and designed to ensure its independence, rules which include, in particular, those mentioned in paragraph\u00a053 of the present judgment.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court of Wiesbaden) must, in this instance, be considered to be a \u2018court or tribunal\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a0267 TFEU. The request for a preliminary ruling is therefore admissible.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be made clear that that conclusion has no effect on the examination of the admissibility of the second question referred for a preliminary ruling, which, as such, is inadmissible. Since that question concerns the interpretation of Article\u00a0267 TFEU itself, which is not at issue for the purposes of resolving the dispute in the main proceedings, the interpretation requested by that question is not objectively required for the decision which must be made by the referring court (see, to that effect, order of 25\u00a0May 1998, \nNour\n, C-361/97, EU:C:1998:250, paragraph\u00a015 and the case-law cited).\n\u00a0\nThe request for a preliminary ruling\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its request for a preliminary ruling, the referring court asks the Court, in essence, whether Article\u00a04(7) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the Petitions Committee of the parliament of a Federated State of a Member State must be categorised as a \u2018controller\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, so that the processing of personal data carried out by that committee falls within the scope of that regulation, and, in particular, of Article\u00a015 thereof.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer that question, it must, first, be noted that Article\u00a04(7) of that regulation defines the \u2018controller\u2019 as being the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the definition of the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 in Regulation 2016/679 is not confined to public authorities, but, as emphasised by the Czech Government, is sufficiently wide to include any body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, second, the observations of \nLand\n Hessen to the effect that the activities of a parliamentary committee fall outside the scope of EU law, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(2) of Regulation 2016/679, it must be recalled that the Court has already had occasion to state, in relation to Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, which is based on Article\u00a0100a of the EC Treaty (which became, after amendment, Article\u00a095 EC), that recourse to that legal basis does not presuppose the existence of an actual link with free movement between Member States in every situation referred to by the measure founded on that legal base and that it is not appropriate to interpret the expression \u2018activity which falls outside the scope of [Union] law\u2019 as having a meaning which would require it to be determined in each individual case whether the specific activity at issue directly affected freedom of movement between Member States (judgment of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, \nC-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraphs\u00a040 and 42).\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That applies a fortiori with respect to Regulation 2016/679, which is based on Article\u00a016 TFEU, which states that the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union are to lay down the rules relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by, in particular, Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Union law, and the rules relating to the free movement of such data; Article\u00a02(2) of that regulation corresponds, in essence, to Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, since Article\u00a02(2)(a) of that regulation constitutes an exception to the very wide definition of the scope of that regulation set out in Article\u00a02(1) of that regulation, Article\u00a02(2)(a) must be interpreted restrictively.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Admittedly, the Court has, in essence, stated that the activities mentioned by way of example in the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 (in other words, the activities provided for by Titles\u00a0V and VI of the Treaty on European Union and data processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security and activities in areas of criminal law) are, in all circumstances, activities of the States or of State authorities, and those activities are intended to define the extent of the exception provided for therein, with the result that that exception applies only to the activities which are expressly listed there or which can be classified in the same category (\nejusdem generis\n) (judgment of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, \nC-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraphs\u00a043 and 44).\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, that fact that an activity is an activity characteristic of the State or of a public authority is not sufficient ground for that exception to be automatically applicable to such an activity. It is necessary that that activity is one of the activities that are explicitly mentioned by that provision or that it can be classified in the same category as those activities.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the activities of the Petitions Committee of the Parliament of \nLand\n Hessen are incontestably public and are activities of that \nLand\n, that committee contributing indirectly to the parliamentary activity, the fact remains that not only are those activities political as much as administrative, but it is also not clear from the documents available to the Court that those activities correspond, in this instance, to the activities mentioned in Article\u00a02(2)(b) and (d) of Regulation 2016/679 or that they can be classified in the same category as those activities.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth and last, no exception is provided for in Regulation 2016/679, including in recital\u00a020 and in Article\u00a023 of that regulation, with respect to parliamentary activities.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, in so far as the Petitions Committee of the Parliament of \nLand\n Hessen determines, alone or with others, the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, that committee must be categorised as a \u2018controller\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7) of Regulation 2016/679 and consequently, Article\u00a015 of that regulation is, in this instance, applicable.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all the foregoing that Article\u00a04(7) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that, in so far as a Petitions Committee of the parliament of a Federated State of a Member State determines, alone or with others, the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, that committee must be categorised as a \u2018controller\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, and consequently the processing of personal data carried out by that committee falls within the scope of that regulation and, in particular, of Article\u00a015 thereof.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a04(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) must be interpreted as meaning that, in so far as a Petitions Committee of the parliament of a Federated State of a Member State determines, alone or with others, the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, that committee must be categorised as a \u2018controller\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, and consequently the processing of personal data carried out by that committee falls within the scope of that regulation and, in particular, of Article\u00a015 thereof."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by

Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits

individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L\u00a0281, p.\u00a031).\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The request has been made in proceedings between Mr\u00a0Patrick Breyer and the Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Federal Republic of Germany) concerning the registration and storage by the latter of the internet protocol address (\u2018IP address\u2019) allocated to Mr\u00a0Breyer when he accessed several internet sites run by German Federal institutions.\n\u00a0\nLegal context\n\u00a0\nEU

identified or identifiable person; whereas, to determine whether a person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said person; whereas the principles of protection shall not apply to data rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable; whereas codes of conduct within the meaning of Article\u00a027 may be a useful instrument for providing guidance as to the ways in which data may be rendered anonymous and retained in a form in which identification of the data subject is no longer possible.\u2019 \n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01 of that directive provides: \n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In

provider may collect and use the personal data of a user only to the extent necessary in order to facilitate, and charge for, the use of telemedia (data concerning use). Data concerning use include, in particular: \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0particulars for the identification of the user, \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0information about the beginning, end and extent of the particular use, and \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0information about the telemedia used by the user. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A service provider may combine the data concerning use of a user relating to the use of different telemedia to the extent that this is necessary for purposes of charging the user.\n\u2026\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A service provider may use data concerning use after the end of the use to the extent that they are required for purposes of charging the user (invoicing data). The service provider may block the data in order to comply with existing limits on storage periods laid down by law, statutes or contract.\u2019 \n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Paragraph\u00a03(1) of the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (Federal Data Protection Law) of 20\u00a0December 1990 (BGBl. 1990 I, p.\u00a02954, \u2018personal data are individual indications concerning the personal or factual circumstances of an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject). \u2026\u2019.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Breyer has accessed several websites operated by German Federal institutions. On the websites, which are accessible to the public, those institutions provide topical information.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the aim of preventing attacks and making it possible to prosecute \u2018pirates\u2019, most of those websites store information on all access operations in logfiles. The information retained in the logfiles after those sites have been accessed include the name of the web page or file to which access was sought, the terms entered in the search fields, the time of access, the quantity of data transferred, an indication of whether access was successful, and the IP address of the computer from which access was sought.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IP addresses are series of digits assigned to networked computers to facilitate their communication over the internet. When a website is accessed, the IP address of the computer seeking access is communicated to the server on which the website consulted is stored. That connection is necessary so that the data accessed maybe transferred to the correct recipient. \n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it is clear from the order for the reference and the documents before the Court that internet service providers allocate to the computers of internet users either a \u2018static\u2019 IP address or a \u2018dynamic\u2019 IP address, that is to say an IP address which changes each time there is a new connection to the internet. Unlike static IP addresses, dynamic IP addresses do not enable a link to be established, through files accessible to the public, between a given computer and the physical connection to the network used by the internet service provider.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Breyer brought an action before the German administrative courts seeking an order restraining the Federal Republic of Germany from storing, or arranging for third parties to store, after consultation of the websites accessible to the public run by the German Federal institutions\u2019 online media services, the IP address of the applicant\u2019s host system except in so far as its storage is unnecessary in order to restore the availability of those media in the event of a fault occurring.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Mr\u00a0Breyer\u2019s action at first instance was dismissed, he brought an appeal against that decision.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court of appeal varied that decision in part. It ordered the Federal Republic of Germany to refrain from storing or arranging for third parties to store, at the end of each consultation period, the IP address of the host system from which Mr\u00a0Breyer sought access, which was transmitted when he consulted publicly accessible websites of the German Federal institutions\u2019 online media, where that address is stored together with the date of the consultation period to which it relates and where Mr\u00a0Breyer has revealed his identity during that use, including in the form of an electronic address mentioning his identity, except in so far as that storage is not necessary in order to restore the dissemination of those media in the event of a fault occurring.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the court of appeal, a dynamic IP address, together with the date on which the website was accessed to which that address relates constitutes, if the user of the website concerned has revealed his identity during that consultation period, personal data, because the operator of that website is able to identify the user by linking his name to his computer\u2019s IP address.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the court of appeal held that Mr\u00a0Breyer\u2019s action could not be upheld in other situations. If Mr\u00a0Breyer does not reveal his identity during a consultation period, only the internet service provider could connect the IP address to an identified subscriber. However, in the hands of the Federal Republic of Germany, in its capacity as provider of online media services, the IP address is not personal data, even in combination with the date of the consultation period to which it relates, because the user of the websites concerned is not identifiable by that Member State.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Breyer and the Federal Republic of Germany each brought an appeal on a point of law before the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice, Germany) against the decision of the appeal court. Mr\u00a0Breyer sought to have his application for an injunction upheld in its entirety. The Federal Republic of Germany sought to have it dismissed.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states that the dynamic IP addresses of Mr\u00a0Breyer\u2019s computer stored by the Federal Republic of Germany, acting in its capacity as an online media services provider, are, at least in the context of other data stored in daily files, specific data on Mr\u00a0Breyer\u2019s factual circumstances, given that they provide information relating to his use of certain websites or certain internet files on certain dates. \n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, the data stored does not enable Mr\u00a0Breyer to be directly identified. The operators of the websites at issue in the main proceedings can identify Mr\u00a0Breyer only if the information relating to his identity is communicated to them by his internet service provider. The classification of those data as \u2018personal data\u2019 thus depends on whether Mr\u00a0Breyer is identifiable.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) refers to the academic disagreement relating to whether, in order to determine whether someone is identifiable, an \u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018relative\u2019 criterion must be used. The application of an \u2018objective\u2019 criterion would have the consequence that data such as the IP addresses at issue in the main proceedings may be regarded, at the end of the period of use of the websites at issue, as being personal data even if only a third party is able to determine the identity of the data subject, that third party being, in the present case, Mr\u00a0Breyer\u2019s internet service provider, which stored the additional data enabling his identification by means of those IP addresses. According to a \u2018relative\u2019 criterion, such data may be regarded as personal data in relation to an entity such as Mr\u00a0Breyer\u2019s internet service provider because they allow the user to be precisely identified (see, in that connection, judgment of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nScarlet Extended\n, C-70/10, EU:C:2011:771, paragraph\u00a051), but not being regarded as such with respect to another entity, since that operator does not have, if Mr\u00a0Breyer has not disclosed his identity during the consultation of those websites, the information necessary to identify him without disproportionate effort.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the dynamic IP addresses of Mr\u00a0Breyer\u2019s computer, together with the date of the relevant consultation period, were to be considered as constituting personal data, the referring court asks whether the storage of those IP addresses at the end of that consultation period is authorised by Article\u00a07(f) of that directive.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) states, first, that under Paragraph\u00a015(1) of the TMG, online media services providers may collect and use the personal data of a user only to the extent that that is necessary to facilitate and charge for the use of those media. Second, the referring court states that, according to the Federal Republic of Germany, storage of those data is necessary to guarantee the security and continued proper functioning of the online media services that it makes accessible to the public, in particular, enabling cyber attacks known as \u2018denial-of-service\u2019 attacks, which aim to paralyse the functioning of the sites by the targeted and coordinated saturation of certain web servers with huge numbers of requests, to be identified and combated.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, if and to the extent it is necessary for the online media services provider to take measures to combat such attacks, those measures may be regarded as necessary to \u2018facilitate \u2026 the use of telemedia\u2019 pursuant to Paragraph\u00a015 of the TMG. However, academic opinion mostly supports the view, first, that the collection and use of personal data relating to the user of a website is authorised only in order to facilitate the specific use of that website and, second, that those data must be deleted at the end of period of consultation concerned if they are not data required for billing purposes. Such a restrictive reading of Paragraph 15(1) of the TMG would prevent the storage of IP addresses from being authorised in order to guarantee in a general manner the security and continued proper functioning of online media.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court asks whether that interpretation, which is the interpretation advocated by the court of appeal, is in accordance with Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, having regard, in particular with the criteria laid down by the Court in paragraph\u00a029 et seq. of the judgment of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nASNEF and FECEMD\n (C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777).\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) decided to stay the proceedings before it and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 \u2026 be interpreted as meaning that an internet protocol address (IP address) which an [online media] service provider stores when his website is accessed already constitutes personal data for the service provider if a third party (an access provider) has the additional knowledge required in order to identify the data subject?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does Article\u00a07(f) of [that directive] preclude a provision in national law under which a service provider may collect and use a user\u2019s personal data without his consent only to the extent necessary in order to facilitate, and charge for, the specific use of the telemedium by the user concerned, and under which the purpose of ensuring the general operability of the telemedium cannot justify use of the data beyond the end of the particular use of the telemedium?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks essentially whether Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that a dynamic IP address registered by an online media services provider when a person accesses a website that that provider makes accessible to the public constitutes, with regard to that service provider, personal data within the meaning of that provision, where, only a third party, in the present case the internet service provider, has the additional data necessary to identify him.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to that provision, \u2018personal data\u2019 \u2018mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d)\u2019. Pursuant to that provision, an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it must be noted that, in paragraph\u00a051 of the judgment of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nScarlet Extended\n (C-70/10, EU:C:2011:771), which concerned inter alia the interpretation of the same directive, the Court held essentially that the IP addresses of internet users were protected personal data because they allow users to be precisely identified.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, that finding by the Court related to the situation in which the collection and identification of the IP addresses of internet users is carried out by internet service providers.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the first question concerns the situation in which it is the online media services provider, namely the Federal Republic of Germany, which registers IP addresses of the users of a website that it makes accessible to the public, without having the additional data necessary in order to identify those users.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it is common ground that the IP addresses to which the national court refers are \u2018dynamic\u2019 IP addresses, that is to say provisional addresses which are assigned for each internet connection and replaced when subsequent connections are made, and not \u2018static\u2019 IP addresses, which are invariable and allow continuous identification of the device connected to the network.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court\u2019s first question is based therefore on the premiss, first, that data consisting in a dynamic IP address and the date and time that a website was accessed from that IP address registered by an online media services provider do not, without more, give the service provider the possibility to identify the user who consulted that website during that period of use and, second, the internet services provider has additional data which, if combined with the IP address would enable the user to be identified.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it must be noted, first of all, that it is common ground that a dynamic IP address does not constitute information relating to an \u2018identified natural person\u2019, since such an address does not directly reveal the identity of the natural person who owns the computer from which a website was accessed, or that of another person who might use that computer.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, in order to determine whether, in the situation described in paragraph\u00a037 of the present judgment, a dynamic IP address constitutes personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 96/45 in relation to an online media services provider, it must be ascertained whether such an IP address, registered by such a provider, may be treated as data relating to an \u2018identifiable natural person\u2019 where the additional data necessary in order to identify the user of a website that the services provider makes accessible to the public are held by that user\u2019s internet service provider.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it is clear from the wording of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 that an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use by the EU legislature of the word \u2018indirectly\u2019 suggests that, in order to treat information as personal data, it is not necessary that that information alone allows the data subject to be identified.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, recital 26 of Directive 95/46 states that, to determine whether a person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said person.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as that recital refers to the means likely reasonably to be used by both the controller and by \u2018any other person\u2019, its wording suggests that, for information to be treated as \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of that directive, it is not required that all the information enabling the identification of the data subject must be in the hands of one person.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that the additional data necessary to identify the user of a website are held not by the online media services provider, but by that user\u2019s internet service provider does not appear to be such as to exclude that dynamic IP addresses registered by the online media services provider constitute personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it must be determined whether the possibility to combine a dynamic IP address with the additional data held by the internet service provider constitutes a means likely reasonably to be used to identify the data subject.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, as the Advocate General stated essentially in point\u00a068 of his Opinion, that would not be the case if the identification of the data subject was prohibited by law or practically impossible on account of the fact that it requires a disproportionate effort in terms of time, cost and man-power, so that the risk of identification appears in reality to be insignificant.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the referring court states in its order for reference that German law does not allow the internet service provider to transmit directly to the online media services provider the additional data necessary for the identification of the data subject, it seems however, subject to verifications to be made in that regard by the referring court that, in particular, in the event of cyber attacks legal channels exist so that the online media services provider is able to contact the competent authority, so that the latter can take the steps necessary to obtain that information from the internet service provider and to bring criminal proceedings.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it appears that the online media services provider has the means which may likely reasonably be used in order to identify the data subject, with the assistance of other persons, namely the competent authority and the internet service provider, on the basis of the IP addresses stored.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that a dynamic IP address registered by an online media services provider when a person accesses a website that the provider makes accessible to the public constitutes personal data within the meaning of that provision, in relation to that provider, where the latter has the legal means which enable it to identify the data subject with additional data which the internet service provider has about that person.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks essentially whether Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as precluding the legislation of a Member State under which an online media services provider may collect and use a user\u2019s personal data without his consent only to the extent necessary in order to facilitate, and charge for, the specific use of those services by the user concerned, and under which the purpose of ensuring the general operability of those services cannot justify use of the data beyond the end of the particular use of them.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before answering that question, it must be determined whether the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings, that is dynamic IP addresses of users of certain websites of the German Federal institutions, is excluded from the scope of Directive 95/46 under Article\u00a03(2), first indent thereof, pursuant to which that directive does not apply to personal data processing operations concerning, in particular, the activities of the State in areas of criminal law.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it must be recalled that the activities mentioned by way of examples by that provision are, in any event, activities of the State or of State authorities and unrelated to the fields of activity of individuals (see judgments of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a043, and of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a041).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, subject to verifications to be made in that regard by the referring court, it appears that the German Federal institutions, which provide the online media services and which are responsible for the processing of dynamic IP addresses act, in spite of their status as public authorities, as individuals and outside the activities of the State in the area of criminal law.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it must be determined whether the legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, is compatible with Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, it is important to recall that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, as interpreted in the restrictive sense described by the referring court, authorises the collection and use of personal data relating to a user of those services, without his consent, only to the extent that is necessary to facilitate and charge for the specific use of online media by the user concerned, even though the objective aiming to ensure the general capacity relating to the functioning of the online media may justify the use of those data at the end of that period of use of such media.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, personal data may be processed if \u2018processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection under Article\u00a01(1)\u2019 of the Directive. \n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has held that Article\u00a07 of Directive 95/46 sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of cases in which the processing of personal data can be regarded as being lawful and that the Member States cannot add new principles relating to the lawfulness of the processing of personal data or impose additional requirements that have the effect of amending the scope of one of the six principles provided for in that article (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nASNEF and FECEMD\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraphs\u00a030 and 32).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a05 of Directive 95/46 authorises Member States to specify, within the limits of Chapter II of that directive and, accordingly, Article\u00a07 thereof, the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful, the margin of discretion which Member States have pursuant to Article\u00a05 can therefore be used only in accordance with the objective pursued by that directive of maintaining a balance between the free movement of personal data and the protection of private life. Under Article\u00a05 of Directive 95/46, Member States also cannot introduce principles relating to the lawfulness of the processing of personal data other than those listed in Article\u00a07 thereof, nor can they amend, by additional requirements, the scope of the six principles provided for in Article\u00a07 (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nASNEF and FECEMD\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraphs\u00a033, 34 and 36).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it appears that Paragraph\u00a015 of the TMG, if it were interpreted in the strict manner mentioned in paragraph\u00a055 of the present judgment, has a more restrictive scope than that of the principle laid down in Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46. \n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas Article\u00a07(f) of that directive refers, in a general manner, to \u2018the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed\u2019, Paragraph\u00a015 of the TMG authorises the service provider to collect and use personal data of a user only in so far as that is necessary in order to facilitate, and charge for, the particular use of electronic media. Therefore, Paragraph\u00a015 of the TMG precludes the storage of personal data, after the consultation of online media, in a general manner in order to guarantee the use of those media. The German Federal institutions, which provide online media services, may also have a legitimate interest in ensuring, in addition to the specific use of their publicly accessible websites, the continued functioning of those websites.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, as the Advocate General pointed out, in points\u00a0100 and 101 of his Opinion, such national legislation goes further than defining the notion of \u2018legitimate interests\u2019 in Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, in accordance with Article\u00a05 of Directive 95/46.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a07(f) of that directive precludes Member States from excluding, categorically and in general, the possibility of processing certain categories of personal data without allowing the opposing rights and interests at issue to be balanced against each other in a particular case. Thus, Member States cannot definitively prescribe, for certain categories of personal data, the result of the balancing of the opposing rights and interests, without allowing a different result by virtue of the particular circumstances of an individual case (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nASNEF and FECEMD\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraphs\u00a047 and 48).\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the processing of personal data of the users of online media websites, legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, reduces the scope of the principle laid down in Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 by excluding the possibility to balance the objective of ensuring the general operability of the online media against the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of those users which, in accordance with that provision, calls for protection under Article\u00a01(1) of that directive.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes the legislation of a Member State under which an online media services provider may collect and use personal data relating to a user of those service, without his consent, only in so far as the collection and use of that information are necessary to facilitate and charge for the specific use of those services by that user, even though the objective aiming to ensure the general operability of those services may justify the use of those data after consultation of those websites.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as meaning that a dynamic IP address registered by an online media services provider when a person accesses a website that the provider makes accessible to the public constitutes personal data within the meaning of that provision, in relation to that provider, where the latter has the legal means which enable it to identify the data subject with additional data which the internet service provider has about that person.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as precluding the legislation of a Member State, pursuant to which an online media services provider may collect and use personal data relating to a user of those services, without his consent, only in so far as that the collection and use of that data are necessary to facilitate and charge for the specific use of those services by that user, even though the objective aiming to ensure the general operability of those services may justify the use of those data after a consultation period of those websites."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}
