The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 4 Jul 2023, C-252/21 (\nMeta Platforms and Others\n)\n \nJUDGMENT OF THE COURT

Article\u00a08(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the \u201cCharter\u201d) and Article\u00a016(1) [TFEU] provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\n\u2026\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.\n\u2026\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data. Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children when using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child.\n\u2026\n(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where processing is based on the data subject\u2019s consent, the controller should be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing operation.\u00a0\u2026 For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended. Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\n(43)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in particular where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation. Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance.\n\u2026\n(46)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing of personal data based on the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters.\n(47)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller.\u00a0\u2026 At any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing.\u00a0\u2026 The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.\n\u2026\n(49)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems\u00a0\u2026 constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(51)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. Those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, whereby the use of the term \u201cracial origin\u201d in this Regulation does not imply an acceptance by the [European] Union of theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races. The processing of photographs should not systematically be considered to be processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing is allowed in specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account that Member States law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general principles and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the conditions for lawful processing. Derogations from the general prohibition for processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided, inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\u2019\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04 of that regulation provides:\n\u2018For the purposes of this Regulation:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cpersonal data\u201d means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d);\u00a0\u2026\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cprocessing\u201d means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\n\u2026\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201ccontroller\u201d means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data;

Other undertakings of the Meta group offer, within the European Union, other online services, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and\u00a0\u2013 until 13\u00a0March 2020\u00a0\u2013 Masquerade.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The business model of the online social network Facebook is based on financing through online advertising, which is tailored to the individual users of the social network according, inter alia, to their consumer behaviour, interests, purchasing power and personal situation. Such advertising is made possible in technical terms by the automated production of detailed profiles in respect of the network users and the users of the online services offered at the level of the Meta group. To that end, in addition to the data provided by the users directly when they sign up for the online services concerned, other user- and device-related data are also collected on and off that social network and the online services provided by the Meta group, and linked to their various user accounts. The aggregate view of the data allows detailed conclusions to be drawn about those users\u2019 preferences and interests.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the processing of those data, Meta Platforms Ireland relies on the user agreement to which the users of the social network Facebook adhere when they click on the \u2018Sign up\u2019 button, thereby accepting the general terms drawn up by that company. Acceptance of those terms is necessary in order to be able to use the social network Facebook. With regard to the processing of personal data, the general terms refer to that company\u2019s data and cookies policies. According to those policies, Meta Platforms Ireland collects user- and device-related data about user activities on and off the social network and links the data with the Facebook accounts of the users concerned. The latter data, relating to activities outside the social network (\u2018the off-Facebook data\u2019), are data concerning visits to third-party webpages and apps, which are linked to Facebook through programming interfaces\u00a0\u2013 \u2018Facebook Business Tools\u2019\u00a0\u2013 as well as data concerning the use of other online services belonging to the Meta group, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and\u00a0\u2013 until 13\u00a0March 2020\u00a0\u2013 Masquerade.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Cartel Office brought proceedings against Meta Platforms, Meta Platforms Ireland and Facebook Deutschland, as a result of which, by decision of 6\u00a0February 2019, based on Paragraph\u00a019(1) and Paragraph\u00a032 of the GWB, it essentially prohibited those companies from making, in the general terms, the use of the social network Facebook by private users resident in Germany subject to the processing of their off-Facebook data and from processing the data without their consent on the basis of the general terms in force at the time. In addition, it required them to adapt those general terms in such a way that it is made clear that those data will neither be collected, nor linked with Facebook user accounts nor used without the consent of the user concerned, and it clarified the fact that such a consent is not valid if it is a condition for using the social network.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Cartel Office based its decision on the fact that the processing of the data of the users concerned, as provided for in the general terms and implemented by Meta Platforms Ireland, constituted an abuse of that company\u2019s dominant position on the market for online social networks for private users in Germany, within the meaning of Paragraph\u00a019(1) of the GWB. In particular, according to the Federal Cartel Office, those general terms, as a result of that dominant position, constitute an abuse since the processing of the off-Facebook data that they provide for is not consistent with the underlying values of the GDPR and, in particular, it cannot be justified in the light of Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a09(2) of that regulation.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 11\u00a0February 2019, Meta Platforms, Meta Platforms Ireland and Facebook Deutschland brought an action against the decision of the Federal Cartel Office before the Oberlandesgericht D\u00fcsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 31\u00a0July 2019, Meta Platforms Ireland introduced new general terms expressly stating that the user, instead of paying to use Facebook products, agrees to being shown advertisements.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, since 28\u00a0January 2020, Meta Platforms has been offering, at a global level, \u2018\nOff-Facebook Activity\n\u2019, which allows the users of the social network Facebook to view a summary of the information about them that Meta group companies obtain in relation to their activities on other websites and apps, and to disconnect the data about past and future activities from their Facebook.com account if they so wish.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Oberlandesgericht D\u00fcsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, D\u00fcsseldorf) has doubts (i) as to whether national competition authorities may review, in the exercise of their powers, whether the processing of personal data complies with the requirements set out in the GDPR; (ii) as to whether the operator of an online social network may process the data subject\u2019s sensitive personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a09(1) and (2) of that regulation; (iii) as to the lawfulness of the processing by such an operator of the personal data of the user concerned, under Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation; and (iv) as to the validity, in the light of point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a09(2)(a) of that regulation, of the consent given to an undertaking with a dominant position on the national market for online social networks for the purposes of such processing.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, taking the view that the resolution of the case in the main proceedings depends on the answer to those questions, the Oberlandesgericht D\u00fcsseldorf (Higher Regional Court, D\u00fcsseldorf) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary

and 7, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a051 et seq. of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that a competition authority of a Member State can find, in the context of the examination of an abuse of a dominant position by an undertaking within the meaning of Article\u00a0102 TFEU, that that undertaking\u2019s general terms of use relating to the processing of personal data and the implementation thereof are not consistent with the GDPR, and if so, whether Article\u00a04(3) TEU must be interpreted as meaning that such a finding, of an incidental nature, by the competition authority is also possible where those terms are being investigated, simultaneously, by the competent lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article\u00a056(1) of the GDPR.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer that question, it is important to recall at the outset that Article\u00a055(1) of the GDPR states the general rule that each supervisory authority is to be competent for the performance of the tasks assigned to it and the exercise of the powers conferred on it, in accordance with that regulation, on the territory of its own Member State (judgment of 15\u00a0June 2021, \nFacebook Ireland and Others\n, C-645/19, EU:C:2021:483, paragraph\u00a047 and the case-law cited).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tasks assigned to those supervisory authorities include monitoring and enforcing the application of the GDPR, as provided for in Article\u00a051(1) and Article\u00a057(1)(a) of that regulation, in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate the free flow of such data within the European Union. In addition, in accordance with Article\u00a051(2) and Article\u00a057(1)(g) of that regulation, the supervisory authorities must cooperate with each other, including sharing information, and provide mutual assistance with a view to ensuring the consistency of application and enforcement of the regulation.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to carry out those tasks, Article\u00a058 of the GDPR confers on those supervisory authorities, in paragraph\u00a01, investigative powers, in paragraph\u00a02, corrective powers, and in paragraph\u00a05, the power to bring infringements of that regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and, where appropriate, to commence legal proceedings in order to enforce the provisions of that regulation.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to the rule on competence set out in Article\u00a055(1) of the GDPR, Article\u00a056(1) of that regulation lays down, with respect to \u2018cross-border processing\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(23) of that regulation, the \u2018one-stop-shop mechanism\u2019, based on an allocation of competences between one \u2018lead supervisory authority\u2019 and the other supervisory authorities concerned as well as on cooperation between all of those authorities in accordance with the cooperation procedure laid down in Article\u00a060 of that regulation.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Article\u00a061(1) of the GDPR obliges the supervisory authorities, inter alia, to provide each other with relevant information and mutual assistance in order to implement and apply that regulation in a consistent manner throughout the European Union. Article\u00a063 of the GDPR states that it was for that purpose that provision was made for the consistency mechanism set out in Articles\u00a064 and 65 of that regulation (judgment of 15\u00a0June 2021, \nFacebook Ireland and Others\n, C-645/19, EU:C:2021:483, paragraph\u00a052 and the case-law cited).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, it should be noted that the rules on cooperation laid down in the GDPR are not addressed to the national competition authorities but govern cooperation between the national supervisory authorities concerned and the lead supervisory authority as well as, where appropriate, cooperation between those authorities and the European Data Protection Board and the Commission.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither the GDPR nor any other instrument of EU law provides for specific rules on cooperation between a national competition authority and the relevant national supervisory authorities concerned or the lead supervisory authority. Furthermore, there is no provision in that regulation that prevents the national competition authorities from finding, in the performance of their duties, that a data processing operation carried out by an undertaking in a dominant position and liable to constitute an abuse of that position does not comply with that regulation.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be made clear, in the first place, that the supervisory authorities, on the one hand, and the national competition authorities, on the other, perform different functions and pursue their own objectives and tasks.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the one hand, as has been stated in paragraph\u00a038 above, under Article\u00a051(1) and (2) and Article\u00a057(1)(a) and (g) of the GDPR, the primary task of the supervisory authority is to monitor and enforce the application of that regulation, while contributing to its consistent application within the European Union, in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate the free flow of such data within the European Union. To that end, as recalled in paragraph\u00a039 above, the supervisory authority has at its disposal the various powers conferred on it under Article\u00a058 of the GDPR.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, in accordance with Article\u00a05 of Regulation No\u00a01/2003, the national competition authorities have the power to take, inter alia, decisions finding an abuse of a dominant position by an undertaking, within the meaning of Article\u00a0102 TFEU, whose objective is to establish a system which ensures that competition in the internal market is not distorted, having regard also to the consequences of such an abuse for consumers in that market.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point\u00a023 of his Opinion, when taking such a decision, a competition authority must assess, on the basis of all the specific circumstances of the case, whether, by resorting to methods different from those governing normal competition in products or services, the conduct of the dominant undertaking has the effect of hindering the maintenance of the degree of competition existing in the market or the growth of that competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 25\u00a0March 2021, \nDeutsche Telekom\n v \nCommission\n, C-152/19\u00a0P, EU:C:2021:238, paragraphs\u00a041 and 42). In that respect, the compliance or non-compliance of that conduct with the provisions of the GDPR may, depending on the circumstances, be a vital clue among the relevant circumstances of the case in order to establish whether that conduct entails resorting to methods governing normal competition and to assess the consequences of a certain practice in the market or for consumers.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in the context of the examination of an abuse of a dominant position by an undertaking on a particular market, it may be necessary for the competition authority of the Member State concerned also to examine whether that undertaking\u2019s conduct complies with rules other than those relating to competition law, such as the rules on the protection of personal data laid down by the GDPR.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the different objectives pursued by the rules established in competition matters, in particular Article\u00a0102 TFEU, on the one hand, and those laid down in relation to the protection of personal data under the GDPR, on the other, it must be held that, where a national competition authority identifies an infringement of that regulation in the context of the finding of an abuse of a dominant position, it does not replace the supervisory authorities. In particular, that national competition authority neither monitors nor enforces the application of that regulation for the purpose referred to in Article\u00a051(1) of the GDPR, namely in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing or to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the European Union. Furthermore, by merely noting the non-compliance of a data processing operation with the GDPR for the sole purpose of establishing an abuse of a dominant position and by imposing measures to put an end to that abuse on a legal basis derived from competition law, that authority does not carry out any of the tasks set out in Article\u00a057 of that regulation, nor does it make use of the powers reserved to the supervisory authority under Article\u00a058 of that regulation.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it is important to state that access to and use of personal data are of great importance in the context of the digital economy. That importance is illustrated, in the context of the dispute in the main proceedings, by the business model on which the social network Facebook relies, which, as recalled in paragraph\u00a027 above, provides for financing through the marketing of personalised advertising messages according to user profiles established on the basis of personal data collected by Meta Platforms Ireland.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As pointed out by the Commission, inter alia, access to personal data and the fact that it is possible to process such data have become a significant parameter of competition between undertakings in the digital economy. Therefore, excluding the rules on the protection of personal data from the legal framework to be taken into consideration by the competition authorities when examining an abuse of a dominant position would disregard the reality of this economic development and would be liable to undermine the effectiveness of competition law within the European Union.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in the second place, it should be noted that, where a national competition authority considers it necessary to rule, in the context of a decision on an abuse of a dominant position, on the compliance or non-compliance with the GDPR of the processing of personal data by the undertaking in question, that authority and the supervisory authority concerned or, where appropriate, the competent lead supervisory authority within the meaning of that regulation must cooperate with each other in order to ensure the consistency of application of that regulation.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although, as has been noted in paragraphs\u00a042 and 43 above, neither the GDPR nor any other instrument of EU law provides for specific rules in that regard, the fact remains that, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point\u00a028 of his Opinion, when they apply the GDPR, the various national authorities involved are all bound by the duty of sincere cooperation enshrined in Article\u00a04(3) TEU. Under that principle, in accordance with settled case-law, in areas covered by EU law, Member States, including their administrative authorities, must assist each other, in full mutual respect, in carrying out tasks which flow from the Treaties, take any appropriate measure to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising from, inter alia, the acts of the institutions of the European Union and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the European Union\u2019s objectives (see, to that effect, judgments of 7\u00a0November 2013, \nUPC Nederland\n, C-158/11, EU:C:2013:709, paragraph\u00a059, and of 1\u00a0August 2022, \nSea Watch\n, C-14/21 and C-15/21, EU:C:2022:604, paragraph\u00a0156).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in the light of this principle, when national competition authorities are called upon, in the exercise of their powers, to examine whether an undertaking\u2019s conduct is consistent with the provisions of the GDPR, they are required to consult and cooperate sincerely with the national supervisory authorities concerned or with the lead supervisory authority, all of which are then bound, in that context, to observe their respective powers and competences, in such a way as to ensure that the obligations arising from the GDPR and the objectives of that regulation are complied with while their effectiveness is safeguarded.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The examination by a competition authority of an undertaking\u2019s conduct in the light of the provisions of the GDPR may entail the risk of divergences between that authority and the supervisory authorities in the interpretation of that regulation.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, where, in the context of the examination seeking to establish whether there is an abuse of a dominant position within the meaning of Article\u00a0102 TFEU by an undertaking, a national competition authority takes the view that it is necessary to examine whether that undertaking\u2019s conduct is consistent with the provisions of the GDPR, that authority must ascertain whether that conduct or similar conduct has already been the subject of a decision by the competent national supervisory authority or the lead supervisory authority or the Court. If that is the case, the national competition authority cannot depart from it, although it remains free to draw its own conclusions from the point of view of the application of competition law.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where it has doubts as to the scope of the assessment carried out by the competent national supervisory authority or the lead supervisory authority, where the conduct in question or similar conduct is, simultaneously, under examination by those authorities, or where, in the absence of investigation by those authorities, it takes the view that an undertaking\u2019s conduct is not consistent with the provisions of the GDPR, the national competition authority must consult and seek their cooperation in order to dispel its doubts or to determine whether it must wait for the supervisory authority concerned to take a decision before starting its own assessment.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For its part, where the supervisory authority is called upon by a national competition authority, it must respond to such a request for information or cooperation within a reasonable period of time, providing the latter with the information in its possession capable of dispelling that authority\u2019s doubts as to the scope of the assessment carried out by the supervisory authority or, where appropriate, by informing the national competition authority if it intends to initiate the cooperation procedure with the other supervisory authorities concerned or with the lead supervisory authority, in accordance with Article\u00a060 et seq. of the GDPR, in order to reach a decision seeking to establish whether or not the conduct in question is consistent with that regulation.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the absence of a reply, within a reasonable time, from the supervisory authority thus called upon, the national competition authority may continue its own investigation. The same applies where the competent national supervisory authority and the lead supervisory authority have no objection to such an investigation being continued without having to wait for a decision on their part.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the file before the Court that in October and November 2018, that is to say, before the adoption of the decision of 6\u00a0February 2019, the Federal Cartel Office contacted the Bundesbeauftragte f\u00fcr den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit (BfDI) (Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Germany), the Hamburgische Beauftragte f\u00fcr Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit (Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Hamburg, Germany), which is the competent authority for Facebook Deutschland, and the Data Protection Commission (DPC) (Ireland), to notify those authorities of the action it had taken. In addition, it is apparent that the Federal Cartel Office obtained confirmation that no investigation was being conducted at the time by those authorities in relation to facts similar to those at issue in the main proceedings, and they raised no objection to its actions. Finally, in paragraphs\u00a0555 and 556 of its decision of 6\u00a0February 2019, the Federal Cartel Office expressly referred to that cooperation.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, and subject to verification by the referring court, the Federal Cartel Office appears to have fulfilled its obligations of sincere cooperation with the national supervisory authorities concerned and the lead supervisory authority.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Questions 1 and 7 is that Article\u00a051 et seq. of the GDPR and Article\u00a04(3) TEU must be interpreted as meaning that, subject to compliance with its duty of sincere cooperation with the supervisory authorities, a competition authority of a Member State can find, in the context of the examination of an abuse of a dominant position by an undertaking within the meaning of Article\u00a0102 TFEU, that that undertaking\u2019s general terms of use relating to the processing of personal data and the implementation thereof are not consistent with that regulation, where that finding is necessary to establish the existence of such an abuse.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of this duty of sincere cooperation, the national competition authority cannot depart from a decision by the competent national supervisory authority or the competent lead supervisory authority concerning those general terms or similar general terms. Where it has doubts as to the scope of such a decision, where those terms or similar terms are, simultaneously, under examination by those authorities, or where, in the absence of an investigation or decision by those authorities, the competition authority takes the view that the terms in question are not consistent with the GDPR, it must consult and seek the cooperation of those supervisory authorities in order to dispel its doubts or to determine whether it must wait for them to take a decision before starting its own assessment. In the absence of any objection on their part or of any reply within a reasonable time, the national competition authority may continue its own investigation.\n\u00a0\nQ\nuestion\n 2\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 2(a), the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, where the user of an online social network visits websites or apps to which one or more of the categories referred to in that provision relate and, as the case may be, enters information into them when registering or when placing online orders, the processing of personal data by the operator of that online social network, which entails the collection\u00a0\u2013 by means of integrated interfaces, cookies or similar storage technologies\u00a0\u2013 of data from visits to those sites and apps and of the information entered by the user, the linking of all those data with the user\u2019s social network account and the use of those data by that operator, must be regarded as \u2018processing of special categories of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of that provision, which is in principle prohibited, subject to the derogations provided for in Article\u00a09(2).\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If so, the referring court asks, in essence, by Question 2(b), whether Article\u00a09(2)(e) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, where the user of an online social network visits websites or apps to which the categories set out in Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR relate, enters information into those sites or apps or clicks or taps on the buttons integrated into them, such as the \u2018Like\u2019 or \u2018Share\u2019 buttons or the buttons enabling the user to identify himself or herself on those sites or apps using the login credentials linked to his or her online social network user account, his or her telephone number or email address, the user is deemed to have manifestly made public, within the meaning of the first of those provisions, the data collected on that occasion by the operator of that online social network via cookies or similar storage technologies.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 2(a)\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recital\u00a051 of the GDPR states that personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. That recital further states that such personal data should not be processed unless processing is allowed in the specific cases set out in that regulation.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR lays down the principle that the processing of special categories of personal data listed therein is prohibited. This includes data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs and data concerning health or a natural person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of applying Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR, it is important to determine, where personal data is processed by the operator of an online social network, if those data allow information falling within one of the categories referred to in that provision to be revealed, irrespective of whether that information concerns a user of that network or any other natural person. If so, then such processing of personal data is prohibited, subject to the derogations provided for in Article\u00a09(2) of the GDPR.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in points\u00a040 and 41 of his Opinion, that fundamental prohibition, laid down in Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR, is independent of whether or not the information revealed by the processing operation in question is correct and of whether the controller is acting with the aim of obtaining information that falls within one of the special categories referred to in that provision.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the significant risks to the fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights of data subjects arising from any processing of personal data falling within the categories referred to in Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR, the objective thereof is to prohibit such processing, irrespective of its stated purpose.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the processing operation at issue in the main proceedings carried out by Meta Platforms Ireland entails, first of all, the collection of personal data of the users of the social network Facebook when they visit websites or apps\u00a0\u2013 including those that may reveal information falling within one or more of the categories referred to in Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR\u00a0\u2013 and, as the case may be, they enter information into them when they register or place online orders, then the linking of those data with those users\u2019 social network accounts and, lastly, the use of those data.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it will be for the referring court to determine whether the data thus collected, on their own or by linking them with the Facebook accounts of the users concerned, actually allow such information to be revealed, irrespective of whether that information concerns a user of that network or any other natural person. However, given the referring court\u2019s questions, it should be made clear that it appears, subject to verification by that court, that the processing of data relating to visits to the websites or apps in question may, in certain cases, reveal such information without it being necessary for those users to enter information into them when they register or place online orders.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Question 2(a) is that Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, where the user of an online social network visits websites or apps to which one or more of the categories referred to in that provision relate and, as the case may be, enters information into them when registering or when placing online orders, the processing of personal data by the operator of that online social network, which entails the collection\u00a0\u2013 by means of integrated interfaces, cookies or similar storage technologies\u00a0\u2013 of data from visits to those sites and apps and of the information entered by the user, the linking of all those data with the user\u2019s social network account and the use of those data by that operator, must be regarded as \u2018processing of special categories of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of that provision, which is in principle prohibited, subject to the derogations provided for in Article\u00a09(2), where that data processing allows information falling within one of those categories to be revealed, irrespective of whether that information concerns a user of that network or any other natural person.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 2(b)\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards Question 2(b), as reformulated in paragraph\u00a065 above and which relates to the derogation laid down in Article\u00a09(2)(e) of the GDPR, it must be recalled that, under that provision, the fundamental prohibition of any processing of special categories of personal data, established in Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR, does not apply in the circumstance where the processing relates to personal data which are \u2018manifestly made public by the data subject\u2019.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, first, the derogation applies only to data which are manifestly made public \u2018by the data subject\u2019. Accordingly, it is not applicable to data concerning persons other than the person who made those data public.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, in so far as it provides for an exception to the principle that the processing of special categories of personal data is prohibited, Article\u00a09(2) of the GDPR must be interpreted strictly (see, to that effect, judgments of 17\u00a0September 2014, \nBaltic Agro\n, C-3/13, EU:C:2014:2227, paragraph\u00a024 and the case-law cited, and of 6\u00a0June 2019, \nWeil\n, C-361/18, EU:C:2019:473, paragraph\u00a043 and the case-law cited).\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, for the purposes of the application of the exception laid down in Article\u00a09(2)(e) of the GDPR, it is important to ascertain whether the data subject had intended, explicitly and by a clear affirmative action, to make the personal data in question accessible to the general public.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as regards, first, visits to websites or apps to which one or more of the categories referred to in Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR relate, it should be noted that the user concerned does not in any way thereby intend to make public the fact that he or she has visited those sites or apps and the data from those visits which can be linked to his or her person. The latter can at most expect the operator of the site or app to have access to those data and to share them, as the case may be and subject to that user\u2019s explicit consent, with certain third parties and not with the general public.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it cannot be inferred from the mere visit to such websites or apps by a user that the personal data in question were manifestly made public by that user within the meaning of Article\u00a09(2)(e) of the GDPR.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as regards the entering of information into those websites or apps and the clicking or tapping on buttons integrated into them, such as the \u2018Like\u2019 or \u2018Share\u2019 buttons or buttons enabling the user to identify himself or herself on a website or app using the login credentials linked to his or her Facebook user account, his or her telephone number or email address, it should be noted that these actions mean that the user interacts with the website or app in question, and, as the case may be, the website of the online social network, whereby the extent to which that interaction is public may vary in that it may be determined by the individual settings chosen by that user.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it is for the referring court to ascertain whether it is possible for the users concerned to decide, on the basis of settings selected with full knowledge of the facts, whether to make the information entered into the websites or apps in question and the data from clicking or tapping on buttons integrated into them accessible to the general public or, rather, to a more or less limited number of selected persons.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the users concerned actually have that choice, they can be regarded, when they voluntarily enter information into a website or app or when they click or tap on buttons integrated into them, as manifestly making public, within the meaning of Article\u00a09(2)(e) of the GDPR, data relating to them only in the circumstance where, on the basis of individual settings selected with full knowledge of the facts, those users have clearly made the choice to have the data made accessible to an unlimited number of persons, which it is for the referring court to ascertain.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, if no such individual settings are available, it must be held, in the light of what has been stated in paragraph\u00a077 above, that, where users voluntarily enter information into a website or app or click or tap on buttons integrated into them, they must, in order to be deemed to have manifestly made those data public, have explicitly consented, on the basis of express information provided by that site or app prior to any such entering or clicking or tapping, to the data being viewed by any person having access to that site or app.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Question 2(b) is that Article\u00a09(2)(e) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, where the user of an online social network visits websites or apps to which one or more of the categories set out in Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR relate, the user does not manifestly make public, within the meaning of the first of those provisions, the data relating to those visits collected by the operator of that online social network via cookies or similar storage technologies.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where he or she enters information into such websites or apps or where he or she clicks or taps on buttons integrated into those sites and apps, such as the \u2018Like\u2019 or \u2018Share\u2019 buttons or buttons enabling the user to identify himself or herself on those sites or apps using login credentials linked to his or her social network user account, his or her telephone number or email address, that user manifestly makes public, within the meaning of Article\u00a09(2)(e), the data thus entered or resulting from the clicking or tapping on those buttons only in the circumstance where he or she has explicitly made the choice beforehand, as the case may be on the basis of individual settings selected with full knowledge of the facts, to make the data relating to him or her publicly accessible to an unlimited number of persons.\n\u00a0\nQ\nuestions\n 3 to 5\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Questions 3 and 4, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether and under what conditions points (b) and (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of such data, may be considered to be necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subjects are party, within the meaning of point (b), or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, within the meaning of point (f). That court asks, in particular, whether, to that end, certain interests which it explicitly lists constitute \u2018legitimate interests\u2019 within the meaning of the latter provision.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 5, the referring court asks, in essence, whether points (c) to (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that such processing of personal data can be regarded as necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, within the meaning of point (c), in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, within the meaning of point (d), or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, within the meaning of point (e), where such processing is carried out, respectively, in order to respond to a legitimate request for certain data, to combat harmful behaviour and promote security, and to research for social good and promote safety, integrity and security.\n\u00a0\nPreliminary observations\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it must be observed, first, that Questions 3 to 5 are raised on account of the fact that, according to the findings of the Federal Cartel Office in its decision of 6\u00a0February 2019, the users of the social network Facebook cannot be regarded as having given their consent to the processing of their data at issue in the main proceedings, within the meaning of point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a09(2)(a) of the GDPR. It is therefore in that context that the referring court, while asking the Court by Question 6 in relation to that premiss, considers that it must ascertain whether that processing corresponds to one of the other conditions of lawfulness referred to in points (b) to (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1)of that regulation.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should be noted that the operations entailing the collection, the linking and the use of the data, referred to in Questions 3 to 5, may include both sensitive data within the meaning of Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR and non-sensitive data. It must be made clear that, where a set of data containing both sensitive data and non-sensitive data is subject to such operations and is, in particular, collected \nen bloc\n without it being possible to separate the data items from each other at the time of collection, the processing of that set of data must be regarded as being prohibited, within the meaning of Article\u00a09(1) of the GDPR, if it contains at least one sensitive data item and none of the derogations in Article\u00a09(2) of that regulation applies.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, in order to answer Questions 3 to 5, it should be recalled that the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of the cases in which processing of personal data can be regarded as lawful. Thus, in order to be capable of being regarded as such, processing must fall within one of the cases provided for in that provision (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a099 and the case-law cited).\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, the processing of personal data is lawful if and to the extent that the data subject has given consent for one or more specific purposes.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the absence of such consent, or where that consent is not freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(11) of the GDPR, such processing is nevertheless justified where it meets one of the requirements of necessity mentioned in points (b) to (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the justifications provided for in that latter provision, in so far as they allow the processing of personal data carried out in the absence of the data subject\u2019s consent to be made lawful, must be interpreted restrictively (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0February 2022, \nValsts ie\u0146\u0113mumu dienests (Processing of personal data for tax purposes)\n, C-175/20, EU:C:2022:124, paragraph\u00a073 and the case-law cited).\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as the Court has held, where it can be found that the processing of personal data is necessary in respect of one of the justifications provided for in points (b) to (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, it is not necessary to determine whether that processing also falls within the scope of another of those justifications (see, to that effect, judgment of 1\u00a0August 2022, \nVyriausioji tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija\n, C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601, paragraph\u00a071).\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should finally be noted that, in accordance with Article\u00a05 of the GDPR, the controller bears the burden of proving that those data are collected, inter alia, for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and that they are processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject. In addition, according to Article\u00a013(1)(c) of that regulation, where personal data are collected from the data subject, the controller must inform the data subject of the purposes of the processing for which those data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although it is for the referring court to determine whether the various elements of the processing at issue in the main proceedings are justified by one or other of the necessity requirements referred to in points (b) to (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, the Court can nevertheless provide it with useful guidance to enable it to resolve the dispute before it.\n\u00a0\nQuestions 3 and 4\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the first place, point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, that provision provides that processing of personal data is lawful if it is \u2018necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract\u2019.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in order for the processing of personal data to be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract, within the meaning of that provision, it must be objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to the contractual obligation intended for the data subject. The controller must therefore be able to demonstrate how the main subject matter of the contract cannot be achieved if the processing in question does not occur.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that such processing may be referred to in the contract or may be merely useful for the performance of the contract is, in itself, irrelevant in that regard. The decisive factor for the purposes of applying the justification set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR is rather that the processing of personal data by the controller must be essential for the proper performance of the contract concluded between the controller and the data subject and, therefore, that there are no workable, less intrusive alternatives.\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a054 of his Opinion, where the contract consists of several separate services or elements of a service that can be performed independently of one another, the applicability of point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR should be assessed in the context of each of those services separately.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, in the context of the justifications that are capable of falling within the scope of that provision, the referring court mentions, as elements intended to ensure the proper performance of the contract concluded between Meta Platforms Ireland and its users, personalised content and the consistent and seamless use of the Meta group\u2019s own services.\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, first, the justification based on personalised content, it is important to note that, although such a personalisation is useful to the user, in so far as it enables the user, inter alia, to view content corresponding to a large extent to his or her interests, the fact remains that, subject to verification by the referring court, personalised content does not appear to be necessary in order to offer that user the services of the online social network. Those services may, where appropriate, be provided to the user in the form of an equivalent alternative which does not involve such a personalisation, such that the latter is not objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to those services.\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, second, the justification based on the consistent and seamless use of the Meta group\u2019s own services, it is apparent from the file before the Court that there is no obligation to subscribe to the various services offered by the Meta group in order to create a user account in the social network Facebook. The various products and services offered by that group can be used independently of each other and the use of each product or service is based on the conclusion of a separate user agreement.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, and subject to verification by the referring court, the processing of personal data from services offered by the Meta group, other than the online social network service, does not appear to be necessary for the latter service to be provided.\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the second place, point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, that provision provides that the processing of personal data is lawful only if it is \u2018necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child\u2019.\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has already held, that provision lays down three cumulative conditions so that the processing of personal data covered by that provision is lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by a third party; second, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and third, that the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence over the legitimate interest of the controller or of a third party (judgment of 17\u00a0June 2021, \nM.I.C.M.\n, C-597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraph\u00a0106 and the case-law cited).\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, with regard to the condition relating to the pursuit of a legitimate interest, it must be stated that, according to Article\u00a013(1)(d) of the GDPR, it is the responsibility of the controller, at the time when personal data relating to a data subject are collected from that person, to inform him or her of the legitimate interests pursued where that processing is based on point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation.\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, with regard to the condition that the processing of personal data be necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued, that condition requires the referring court to ascertain that the legitimate data processing interests pursued cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a0110 and the case-law cited).\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this context, it should also be recalled that the condition relating to the need for processing must be examined in conjunction with the \u2018data minimisation\u2019 principle enshrined in Article\u00a05(1)(c) of the GDPR, in accordance with which personal data must be \u2018adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed\u2019 (see, to that effect, judgment of 11\u00a0December 2019, \nAsocia\u0163ia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA\n, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraph\u00a048).\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, with regard to the condition that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence over the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party, the Court has already held that that condition entails a balancing of the opposing rights and interests at issue which depends in principle on the specific circumstances of the particular case and that, consequently, it is for the referring court to carry out that balancing exercise, taking account of those specific circumstances (judgment of 17\u00a0June 2021, \nM.I.C.M.\n, C-597/19, EU:C:2021:492, paragraph\u00a0111 and the case-law cited).\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it is apparent from the very wording of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR that it is necessary, in such a balancing exercise, to pay particular attention to the situation where the data subject is a child. According to recital\u00a038 of that regulation, children merit specific protection with regard to the processing of their personal data because they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned and of their rights related to such processing of personal data. Thus, such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the processing of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles or offering services aimed directly at children.\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as can be seen from recital\u00a047 of the GDPR, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject may in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect such processing.\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, in the context of the justifications that are capable of falling within the scope of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, the referring court mentions personalised advertising, network security, product improvement, the sharing of informing with law-enforcement agencies, the fact that the user is a minor, research and innovation for social good and the offer of services for commercial communication intended for the user and of analytics tools intended for advertisers and other business partners, enabling them to evaluate their performance.\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted at the outset that the request for a preliminary ruling does not contain any explanation as to how research and innovation for social good or the fact that the user is a minor could justify, as legitimate interests within the meaning of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, the collection and use of the data in question. Consequently, the Court is not in a position to rule on this matter.\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, with regard to personalised advertising, it must be borne in mind that, according to recital\u00a047 of the GDPR, the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest of the controller.\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, such processing must also be necessary in order to achieve that interest and the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the data subject must not override that interest. In the context of that balancing of the opposing rights at issue, namely, those of the controller, on the one hand, and those of the data subject, on the other, account must be taken, as has been noted in paragraph\u00a0112 above, in particular of the reasonable expectations of the data subject as well as the scale of the processing at issue and its impact on that person.\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, it is important to note that, despite the fact that the services of an online social network such as Facebook are free of charge, the user of that network cannot reasonably expect that the operator of the social network will process that user\u2019s personal data, without his or her consent, for the purposes of personalised advertising. In those circumstances, it must be held that the interests and fundamental rights of such a user override the interest of that operator in such personalised advertising by which it finances its activity, with the result that the processing by that operator for such purposes cannot fall within the scope of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR.\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the processing at issue in the main proceedings is particularly extensive since it relates to potentially unlimited data and has a significant impact on the user, a large part\u00a0\u2013 if not almost all\u00a0\u2013 of whose online activities are monitored by Meta Platforms Ireland, which may give rise to the feeling that his or her private life is being continuously monitored.\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as regards the objective of ensuring network security, that objective, as stated in recital\u00a049 of the GDPR, constitutes a legitimate interest of Meta Platforms Ireland, capable of justifying the processing operation at issue in the main proceedings.\n120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as regards the need for that processing for the purposes of that legitimate interest, the referring court will have to ascertain whether and to what extent the processing of personal data collected from sources outside the social network Facebook is actually necessary to ensure that the internal security of that network is not compromised.\n121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, as noted in paragraphs\u00a0108 and 109 above, it will also have to ascertain whether the legitimate data processing interest pursued cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental freedoms and rights of the data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter and whether the \u2018data minimisation\u2019 principle enshrined in Article\u00a05(1)(c) of the GDPR has been observed.\n122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, as regards the \u2018product improvement\u2019 objective, it cannot be ruled out from the outset that the controller\u2019s interest in improving the product or service with a view to making it more efficient and thus more attractive can constitute a legitimate interest capable of justifying the processing of personal data and that such processing may be necessary in order to pursue that interest.\n123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, subject to final assessment by the referring court in that respect, it appears doubtful whether, as regards the data processing at issue in the main proceedings, the \u2018product improvement\u2019 objective, given the scale of that processing and its significant impact on the user, as well as the fact that the user cannot reasonably expect those data to be processed by Meta Platforms Ireland, may override the interests and fundamental rights of such a user, particularly in the case where that user is a child.\n124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, as regards the objective referred to by the referring court, relating to the sharing of information with law-enforcement agencies in order to prevent, detect and prosecute criminal offences, it must be held that that objective is not capable, in principle, of constituting a legitimate interest pursued by the controller, within the meaning of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR. A private operator such as Meta Platforms Ireland cannot rely on such a legitimate interest, which is unrelated to its economic and commercial activity. Conversely, that objective may justify processing by such an operator where it is objectively necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which that operator is subject.\n125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to Questions 3 and 4 is that point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data, can be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subjects are party, within the meaning of that provision, only on condition that the processing is objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to the contractual obligation intended for those users, such that the main subject matter of the contract cannot be achieved if that processing does not occur.\n126\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that such processing can be regarded as necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, within the meaning of that provision, only on condition that the operator has informed the users from whom the data have been collected of a legitimate interest that is pursued by the data processing, that such processing is carried out only in so far as is strictly necessary for the purposes of that legitimate interest and that it is apparent from a balancing of the opposing interests, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, that the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of those users do not override that legitimate interest of the controller or of a third party.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 5\n127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, in so far as that question refers to points (c) and (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, it must be recalled that, under point (c), processing of personal data is lawful if it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject. In addition, under point (e), processing that is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller is also lawful.\n128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06(3) of the GDPR specifies, inter alia, in respect of those two situations in which processing is lawful, that the processing must be based on EU law or on Member State law to which the controller is subject, and that that legal basis must meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\n129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the referring court seeks to ascertain whether the processing of personal data, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, may be regarded as justified in the light of point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, where it seeks to \u2018respond to a legitimate request for certain data\u2019, and, in the light of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of that regulation, where its purpose is to \u2018research for social good\u2019 and it seeks to \u2018promote safety, integrity and security\u2019.\n130\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it should be noted that the referring court has not provided the Court of Justice with any material enabling it to give a specific ruling in this respect.\n131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It will therefore be for that court to ascertain, in the light of the conditions set out in paragraph\u00a0128 above, whether that processing can be regarded as being justified by the stated purposes.\n132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, given the observations made in paragraph\u00a0124 above, it will be for the referring court, inter alia, to inquire, for the purposes of applying point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, whether Meta Platforms Ireland is under a legal obligation to collect and store personal data in a preventive manner in order to be able to respond to any request from a national authority seeking to obtain certain data relating to its users.\n133\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, it will be for that court to assess, in the light of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, whether Meta Platforms Ireland was entrusted with a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, in particular with a view of carrying out research for the social good and to promote safety, integrity and security, bearing in mind that, given the type of activity and the essentially economic and commercial nature thereof, it seems unlikely that that private operator was entrusted with such a task.\n134\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the referring court will, if necessary, have to determine whether, in view of the scale of the data processing by Meta Platforms Ireland and of its significant incidence on the users of the social network Facebook, that processing is carried out only in so far as is strictly necessary.\n135\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the second place, point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR, that provision provides that the processing of personal data is lawful where it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\n136\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As can be seen from recital\u00a046 of that regulation, that provision covers the specific situation in which the processing of personal data is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. In that regard, the recital cites by way of example, inter alia, humanitarian purposes, such as monitoring epidemics and their spread, as well as situations of humanitarian emergencies, such as situations of natural and man-made disasters.\n137\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from those examples and from the strict interpretation to be given to point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR that, in view of the nature of the services provided by the operator of an online social network, such an operator, whose activity is essentially economic and commercial in nature, cannot rely on the protection of an interest which is essential for the life of its users or of another person in order to justify, absolutely and in a purely abstract and preventive manner, the lawfulness of data processing such as that at issue in the main proceedings.\n138\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Question 5 is that point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data, is justified, under that provision, where it is actually necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, pursuant to a provision of EU law or the law of the Member State concerned, where that legal basis meets an objective of public interest and is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and where that processing is carried out only in so far as is strictly necessary.\n139\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Points (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that such processing of personal data cannot, in principle and subject to verification by the referring court, be regarded as necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, within the meaning of point (d), or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, within the meaning of point (e).\n\u00a0\nQ\nuestion\n 6\n140\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 6, the referring court asks, in essence, whether point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a09(2)(a) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that consent given by the user of an online social network to the operator of such a network may be regarded as satisfying the conditions of validity laid down in Article\u00a04(11) of that regulation, in particular the condition that that consent must be freely given, where that operator holds a dominant position on the market for online social networks.\n141\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a09(2)(a) of the GDPR require the data subject\u2019s consent for the purposes of, respectively, processing his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes and processing special categories of data referred to in Article\u00a09(1).\n142\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04(11) of the GDPR, for its part, defines \u2018consent\u2019 as meaning \u2018any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her\u2019.\n143\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the referring court\u2019s questions, it is important to recall, in the first place, that, according to recital\u00a042 of the GDPR, consent cannot be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\n144\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, recital\u00a043 of that regulation states that, in order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller. That recital also clarifies that consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case.\n145\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, Article\u00a07(4) of the GDPR provides that when assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account must be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.\n146\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is on the basis of those considerations that Question 6 must be answered.\n147\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, admittedly, the fact that the operator of an online social network, as controller, holds a dominant position on the social network market does not, as such, prevent the users of that social network from validly giving their consent, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(11) of the GDPR, to the processing of their personal data by that operator.\n148\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact remains that, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point\u00a075 of his Opinion, such a circumstance must be taken into consideration in assessing whether the user of that network has validly and, in particular, freely given consent, since that circumstance is liable to affect the freedom of choice of that user, who might be unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment, as stated in recital\u00a042 of the GDPR.\n149\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the existence of such a dominant position may create a clear imbalance, within the meaning of recital\u00a043 of the GDPR, between the data subject and the controller, that imbalance favouring, inter alia, the imposition of conditions that are not strictly necessary for the performance of the contract, which must be taken into account under Article\u00a07(4) of that regulation. In that context, it must be borne in mind that, as stated in paragraphs\u00a0102 to 104 above, it does not appear, subject to verification by the referring court, that the processing at issue in the main proceedings is strictly necessary for the performance of the contract between Meta Platforms Ireland and the users of the social network Facebook.\n150\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, those users must be free to refuse individually, in the context of the contractual process, to give their consent to particular data processing operations not necessary for the performance of the contract, without being obliged to refrain entirely from using the service offered by the online social network operator, which means that those users are to be offered, if necessary for an appropriate fee, an equivalent alternative not accompanied by such data processing operations.\n151\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, given the scale of the processing of the data in question and the significant impact of that processing on the users of that network as well as the fact that those users cannot reasonably expect data other than those relating to their conduct within the social network to be processed by the operator of that network, it is appropriate, within the meaning of recital\u00a043, to have the possibility of giving separate consent for the processing of the latter data, on the one hand, and the off-Facebook data, on the other. It is for the referring court to ascertain whether such a possibility exists, in the absence of which the consent of those users to the processing of the off-Facebook data must be presumed not to be freely given.\n152\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, it must be borne in mind that, pursuant to Article\u00a07(1) of the GDPR, where processing is based on consent, it is the controller who bears the burden of demonstrating that the data subject has consented to the processing of his or her personal data.\n153\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is in the light of those criteria and of a detailed examination of all the circumstances of the case that the referring court will have to determine whether the users of the social network Facebook have validly and, in particular, freely given their consent to the processing at issue in the main proceedings.\n154\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Question 6 is that point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a09(2)(a) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that the operator of an online social network holds a dominant position on the market for online social networks does not, as such, preclude the users of such a network from being able validly to consent, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(11) of that regulation, to the processing of their personal data by that operator. This is nevertheless an important factor in determining whether the consent was in fact validly and, in particular, freely given, which it is for that operator to prove.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n155\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a051 et seq. of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), as well as Article\u00a04(3) TEU\nmust be interpreted as meaning that, subject to compliance with its duty of sincere cooperation with the supervisory authorities, a competition authority of a Member State can find, in the context of the examination of an abuse of a dominant position by an undertaking within the meaning of Article\u00a0102 TFEU, that that undertaking\u2019s general terms of use relating to the processing of personal data and the implementation thereof are not consistent with that regulation, where that finding is necessary to establish the existence of such an abuse.\nIn view of this duty of sincere cooperation, the national competition authority cannot depart from a decision by the competent national supervisory authority or the competent lead supervisory authority concerning those general terms or similar general terms. Where it has doubts as to the scope of such a decision, where those terms or similar terms are, simultaneously, under examination by those authorities, or where, in the absence of an investigation or decision by those authorities, the competition authority takes the view that the terms in question are not consistent with Regulation 2016/679, it must consult and seek the cooperation of those supervisory authorities in order to dispel its doubts or to determine whether it must wait for them to take a decision before starting its own assessment. In the absence of any objection on their part or of any reply within a reasonable time, the national competition authority may continue its own investigation;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a09(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that, where the user of an online social network visits websites or apps to which one or more of the categories referred to in that provision relate and, as the case may be, enters information into them when registering or when placing online orders, the processing of personal data by the operator of that online social network, which entails the collection\u00a0\u2013 by means of integrated interfaces, cookies or similar storage technologies\u00a0\u2013 of data from visits to those sites and apps and of the information entered by the user, the linking of all those data with the user\u2019s social network account and the use of those data by that operator, must be regarded as \u2018processing of special categories of personal data\u2019 within the meaning of that provision, which is in principle prohibited, subject to the derogations provided for in Article\u00a09(2), where that data processing allows information falling within one of those categories to be revealed, irrespective of whether that information concerns a user of that network or any other natural person;\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a09(2)(e) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that, where the user of an online social network visits websites or apps to which one or more of the categories set out in Article\u00a09(1) of that regulation relate, the user does not manifestly make public, within the meaning of the first of those provisions, the data relating to those visits collected by the operator of that online social network via cookies or similar storage technologies;\nWhere he or she enters information into such websites or apps or where he or she clicks or taps on buttons integrated into those sites and apps, such as the \u2018Like\u2019 or \u2018Share\u2019 buttons or buttons enabling the user to identify himself or herself on those sites or apps using login credentials linked to his or her social network user account, his or her telephone number or email address, that user manifestly makes public, within the meaning of Article\u00a09(2)(e), the data thus entered or resulting from the clicking or tapping on those buttons only in the circumstance where he or she has explicitly made the choice beforehand, as the case may be on the basis of individual settings selected with full knowledge of the facts, to make the data relating to him or her publicly accessible to an unlimited number of persons;\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPoint (b) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data, can be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subjects are party, within the meaning of that provision, only on condition that the processing is objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to the contractual obligation intended for those users, such that the main subject matter of the contract cannot be achieved if that processing does not occur;\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPoint (f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data, can be regarded as necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, within the meaning of that provision, only on condition that the operator has informed the users from whom the data have been collected of a legitimate interest that is pursued by the data processing, that such processing is carried out only in so far as is strictly necessary for the purposes of that legitimate interest and that it is apparent from a balancing of the opposing interests, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, that the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of those users do not override that legitimate interest of the controller or of a third party;\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPoint (c) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data, is justified, under that provision, where it is actually necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, pursuant to a provision of EU law or the law of the Member State concerned, where that legal basis meets an objective of public interest and is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and where that processing is carried out only in so far as is strictly necessary;\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPoints (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data by the operator of an online social network, which entails the collection of data of the users of such a network from other services of the group to which that operator belongs or from visits by those users to third-party websites or apps, the linking of those data with the social network account of those users and the use of those data, cannot, in principle and subject to verification by the referring court, be regarded as necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, within the meaning of point (d), or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, within the meaning of point (e);\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPoint (a) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a09(2)(a) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the fact that the operator of an online social network holds a dominant position on the market for online social networks does not, as such, preclude the users of such a network from being able validly to consent, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(11) of that regulation, to the processing of their personal data by that operator. This is nevertheless an important factor in determining whether the consent was in fact validly and, in particular, freely given, which it is for that operator to prove."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Subsequently, BE asked that company, as the personal data controller, to send him the sound recording made at the general meeting.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The company in question made available to BE only the excerpts from that recording which reproduced his contributions, excluding those of the other persons attending the general meeting in question.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BE then asked the supervisory authority (i) to declare that, by failing to provide him with the recording including the answers given to his questions, the company had acted unlawfully and in breach of Regulation 2016/679 and (ii) to order that company to send him the recording in question. The supervisory authority refused that request by decision of 29\u00a0November 2019.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BE brought proceedings before the referring court against that decision of the supervisory authority on the basis of Article\u00a078(1) of that regulation, seeking, principally, that the decision be varied, and, in the alternative, that it be annulled.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time as approaching the supervisory authority, BE initiated another set of proceedings, this time on the basis of Article\u00a079(1) of that regulation, before a civil court, namely the F\u0151v\u00e1rosi \u00cdt\u00e9l\u0151t\u00e1bla (Budapest Regional Court of Appeal, Hungary), against the decision of the controller.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although one set of proceedings are still pending before the referring court, the F\u0151v\u00e1rosi \u00cdt\u00e9l\u0151t\u00e1bla (Budapest Regional Court of Appeal, Hungary) upheld the action in the other set of proceedings, by a judgment which has become final, on the ground that the controller had infringed BE\u2019s right of access to his personal data.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states that it has to examine the same facts and the same allegation of infringement of Regulation 2016/679 as those on which the F\u0151v\u00e1rosi \u00cdt\u00e9l\u0151t\u00e1bla (Budapest Regional Court of Appeal, Hungary) has already given a final ruling. It questions how it should view the relationship between, on the one hand, a civil court\u2019s assessment of the lawfulness of a decision adopted by the personal data controller and, on the other, the administrative procedure which led to the adoption of the supervisory authority\u2019s decision, referred to in paragraph\u00a013 of the present judgment, which forms the subject matter of the action pending before the referring court and, in particular, whether one remedy might take priority over the other.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to that court, the parallel exercise of the remedies provided for in Articles\u00a077 to 79 of Regulation 2016/679 could give rise to contradictory decisions concerning identical facts.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its view, such a situation would risk undermining legal certainty as regards both private persons and supervisory authorities.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states that, having regard to the independence of the supervisory authorities and to the fact that their powers, as defined by Regulation 2016/679, are dominant in the personal data protection system, the tasks and powers of those authorities would be undermined if they were bound, in their assessments, by those of a civil court that was seised at an earlier stage of the same facts on the basis of Article\u00a079(1) of that regulation.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the provisions of that regulation do not lay down any rule of priority in respect of the remedies provided for in Articles\u00a077 to 79 thereof, the referring court considers that it is for the Court of Justice to provide clarification on the relationship between those remedies.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the F\u0151v\u00e1rosi T\u00f6rv\u00e9nysz\u00e9k (Budapest High Court, Hungary) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Articles\u00a077(1) and 79(1) of [Regulation 2016/679] be interpreted as meaning that the administrative appeal provided for in Article\u00a077 [of that regulation] constitutes an instrument for the exercise of public rights, whereas the legal action provided for in Article\u00a079 [thereof] constitutes an instrument for the exercise of private rights? If so, does this support the inference that the supervisory authority, which is responsible for hearing and determining administrative appeals, has priority competence to determine the existence of an infringement?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that the data subject\u00a0\u2013 in whose opinion the processing of personal data relating to him has infringed Regulation 2016/679\u00a0\u2013 simultaneously exercises his right to lodge a complaint under Article\u00a077(1) of that regulation and his right to bring a legal action under Article\u00a079(1) of the same regulation, may an interpretation in accordance with Article\u00a047 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights be regarded as meaning:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the supervisory authority and the court have an obligation to examine the existence of an infringement independently and may therefore even arrive at different outcomes; or\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the supervisory authority\u2019s decision takes priority when it comes to the assessment as to whether an infringement has been committed, regard being had to the powers provided for in Article\u00a051(1) of Regulation 2016/679 and those conferred by Article\u00a058(2)(b) and (d) of that regulation?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the independence of the supervisory authority, ensured by Articles\u00a051(1) and 52(1) of Regulation 2016/679, be interpreted as meaning that that authority, when conducting and adjudicating upon complaint proceedings under Article\u00a077 [of that regulation], is independent of whatever ruling may be given by final judgment by the court having jurisdiction under Article\u00a079 [thereof], with the result that it may even adopt a different decision in respect of the same alleged infringement?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The European Commission has doubts as to the admissibility of the questions referred. It submits that, as is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling, on the date of that request, both the supervisory authority and the civil court had given their decisions, with the result that those questions are, as such, hypothetical. According to the Commission, in reality, the referring court is uncertain as to the relationship between the respective decisions of two national courts, namely the administrative court and the civil court. However, that question was not formulated in the order for reference.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be observed that questions on the interpretation of EU law referred by a national court in the factual and legislative context which that court is responsible for defining, the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court to determine, enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its object, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 10\u00a0February 2022, \nBezirkshauptmannschaft Hartberg-F\u00fcrstenfeld (Limitation period)\n, C-219/20, EU:C:2022:89, paragraph\u00a020 and the case-law cited).\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the request for a preliminary ruling must contain, in accordance with Article\u00a094(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, a statement of the reasons which prompted the referring court or tribunal to inquire about the interpretation of certain provisions of EU law, and the relationship between those provisions and the national legislation applicable to the main proceedings.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is, admittedly, not disputed that the supervisory authority, which had been seised on the basis of Article\u00a077(1) of Regulation 2016/679, gave its decision before the civil court which ruled on the action brought by BE on the basis of Article\u00a079(1) of that regulation had been seised. It is apparent from the facts set out by the referring court that that action gave rise to a judgment which has become final. In addition, it is true that the referring court has mentioned only those two provisions in the questions which it has referred to the Court for a preliminary ruling.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the fact that a question submitted by the referring court refers only to certain provisions of EU law does not mean that the Court may not provide the national court with all the guidance on points of interpretation that may be of assistance in adjudicating on the case pending before it, whether or not that court has referred to those points in its questions. It is, in this regard, for the Court to extract from all the information provided by the referring court, in particular from the grounds of the decision to make the reference, the points of EU law which require interpretation in view of the subject matter of the dispute (judgment of 10\u00a0February 2022, \nBezirkshauptmannschaft Hartberg-F\u00fcrstenfeld (Limitation period)\n, C-219/20, EU:C:2022:89, paragraph\u00a034 and the case-law cited).\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the referring court states that, pursuant to national procedural law, it is not bound by the final judgment delivered by the civil court which ruled on the action brought by BE on the basis of Article\u00a079(1) of Regulation 2016/679. Second, since BE has not withdrawn his action before the referring court, brought on the basis of Article\u00a078(1) of that regulation, seeking the variation or annulment of the decision of the supervisory authority referred to in paragraph\u00a013 of the present judgment, it is for the referring court to rule on the lawfulness of that decision, which was given before the civil court\u2019s judgment had been delivered.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, by its questions, the referring court, which is seised of an action, on the basis of Article\u00a078(1) of Regulation 2016/679, against the supervisory authority\u2019s decision given on the basis of Article\u00a077(1) thereof, seeks to ascertain whether, under the provisions of that regulation, the final judgment delivered by a court seised on the basis of Article\u00a079(1) thereof is binding as regards the finding that there has\u00a0\u2013 or has not\u00a0\u2013 been an infringement of the rights guaranteed by that same regulation.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, in order to provide a useful answer to the referring court, it should be considered that, by its questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, that court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a077(1), Article\u00a078(1) and Article\u00a079(1) of Regulation 2016/679, read in the light of Article\u00a047 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights (\u2018the Charter\u2019), are to be interpreted as meaning that the remedies provided for in Article\u00a077(1) and Article\u00a078(1) of that regulation, on the one hand, and Article\u00a079(1) thereof, on the other, are capable of being exercised concurrently with and independently of each other, or whether one of them has priority over the other.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The questions referred, as thus reformulated, are therefore admissible.\n\u00a0\nSubstance\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with the Court\u2019s settled case-law, in interpreting a provision of EU law it is necessary to consider not only its wording but also its context and the objectives pursued by the legislation of which it forms part (judgment of 2\u00a0December 2021, \nVodafone Kabel Deutschland\n, C-484/20, EU:C:2021:975, paragraph\u00a019 and the case-law cited).\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the wording of the provisions of Regulation 2016/679 referred to in paragraph\u00a030 of the present judgment, it must be borne in mind, first of all, that Article\u00a077(1) of that regulation states that it is \u2018without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy\u2019 that every data subject is to have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. Next, under Article\u00a078(1) of that regulation, each natural or legal person is to have the right to an effective judicial remedy against a legally binding decision of a supervisory authority concerning them \u2018without prejudice to any other administrative or non-judicial remedy\u2019. Lastly, Article\u00a079(1) of that regulation guarantees each data subject the right to an effective judicial remedy \u2018without prejudice to any available administrative or non-judicial remedy, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority pursuant to Article\u00a077\u2019.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, those provisions of Regulation 2016/679 offer different remedies to persons claiming that that regulation has been infringed, it being understood that each of those remedies must be capable of being exercised \u2018without prejudice\u2019 to the others.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows, first of all, from the wording of those provisions that Regulation 2016/679 does not provide for any priority or exclusive competence or jurisdiction or for any rule of precedence in respect of the assessment carried out by the authority or by the courts referred to therein as to whether there is an infringement of the rights conferred by that regulation. The remedy provided for in Article\u00a078(1) of that regulation, the purpose of which is to examine the lawfulness of the decision of a supervisory authority adopted on the basis of Article\u00a077 thereof, and the remedy provided for in Article\u00a079(1) of that regulation may therefore be exercised concurrently with and independently of each other.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, that finding is borne out by the context of the provisions of Regulation 2016/679 at issue.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the EU legislature has expressly regulated the relationship between the remedies provided for by Regulation 2016/679 in the event of the supervisory authorities or courts of several Member States being seised simultaneously in respect of an instance of processing of personal data carried out by the same controller, it must be observed that this is not the case as regards the remedies provided for in Articles\u00a077 to 79 of that regulation.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles\u00a060 to 63 of Regulation 2016/679 provide for cooperation, mutual assistance and coordination mechanisms under which the supervisory authorities are to provide each other with mutual assistance, inform each other and conduct joint operations with a view to ensuring a consistent and effective application of the provisions of that regulation throughout the European Union.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Article\u00a081(2) and (3) of that regulation lays down rules concerning cases where several courts of different Member States have been seised.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, Regulation 2016/679 does not lay down such rules in respect of cases where a complaint has been made to a supervisory authority and judicial proceedings have been brought within the same Member State concerning the same instance of processing of personal data.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it follows from Article\u00a078(1) of Regulation 2016/679, read in the light of recital\u00a0143 of that regulation, that courts seised of an action against a decision of a supervisory authority should exercise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, regarding the objectives pursued by that regulation, it is apparent, in particular, from recital\u00a010 thereof that the aim of that regulation is to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data within the European Union. Recital\u00a011 of that regulation states, moreover, that effective protection of such data requires the strengthening of the rights of data subjects. As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a055 of his Opinion, the EU legislature\u2019s decision to leave to data subjects the option to exercise the remedies provided for in Article\u00a077(1) and Article\u00a078(1) of Regulation 2016/679, on the one hand, and Article\u00a079(1) thereof, on the other, concurrently with and independently of each other is consistent with the objective of that regulation.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulation 2016/679 requires, inter alia, the competent authorities of the Member States to ensure a high level of protection of the rights guaranteed in Article\u00a016 TFEU and Article\u00a08 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 15\u00a0June 2021, \nFacebook Ireland and Others\n, C-645/19, EU:C:2021:483, paragraph\u00a045).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Making several remedies available also strengthens the objective set out in recital\u00a0141 of Regulation 2016/679 of guaranteeing for every data subject who considers that his or her rights under that regulation are infringed the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance with Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the absence of EU rules governing the matter, it is for each Member State, in accordance with the principle of the procedural autonomy of the Member States, to lay down the detailed rules of administrative and judicial procedures intended to ensure a high level of protection of rights which individuals derive from EU law.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it is for the referring court to determine, on the basis of the national procedural provisions, how the remedies provided for by Regulation 2016/679 must be implemented in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, the detailed rules for the implementation of those concurrent and independent remedies should not call into question the effectiveness and effective protection of the rights guaranteed by that regulation.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those detailed rules must not be less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (principle of equivalence); nor must they render practically impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by EU law (principle of effectiveness) (see, to that effect, judgment of 14\u00a0July 2022, \nEPIC Financial Consulting\n, C-274/21 and C-275/21, EU:C:2022:565, paragraph\u00a073 and the case-law cited).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the principle of sincere cooperation laid down in Article\u00a04(3) TEU it is for the courts of the Member States to ensure judicial protection of a person\u2019s rights under EU law. In addition, Article\u00a019(1) TEU requires Member States to provide remedies sufficient to ensure effective judicial protection in the fields covered by EU law (judgment of 27\u00a0September 2017, \nPu\u0161k\u00e1r\n, C-73/16, EU:C:2017:725, paragraph\u00a057).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, when the Member States set out detailed procedural rules for legal actions intended to ensure the protection of rights conferred by Regulation 2016/679, they must ensure compliance with the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, enshrined in Article\u00a047 of the Charter, which constitutes a reaffirmation of the principle of effective judicial protection (see, by analogy, judgment of 27\u00a0September 2017, \nPu\u0161k\u00e1r\n, C-73/16, EU:C:2017:725, paragraph\u00a059).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the Member States must ensure that the practical arrangements for the exercise of the remedies provided for in Article\u00a077(1), Article\u00a078(1) and Article\u00a079(1) of Regulation 2016/679 do not disproportionately affect the right to an effective remedy before a court or tribunal referred to in Article\u00a047 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 27\u00a0September 2017, \nPu\u0161k\u00e1r\n, C-73/16, EU:C:2017:725, paragraph\u00a076).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that the system of remedies under Hungarian law is designed in such a way that the remedies provided for in Article\u00a078(1) and Article\u00a079(1) of Regulation 2016/679 are independent of each other. The referring court states that, pursuant to that law, it is not bound by the decision given by the court seised of an action brought on the basis of Article\u00a079(1) of that regulation, even though the facts of which those courts are seised are the same.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the decisions given by those two courts might be contradictory, with one finding that the provisions of Regulation 2016/679 have been infringed and the other that there has been no such infringement.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that case, first, the existence of two contradictory decisions would call into question the objective, set out in recital\u00a010 of that regulation, of ensuring a consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The protection granted pursuant to a decision given to dispose of an action brought on the basis of Article\u00a079(1) of that regulation, finding that that regulation\u2019s provisions have been infringed, would not be consistent with a second judicial decision resulting from an action brought on the basis of Article\u00a078(1) of that regulation that has the opposite outcome.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the result of this would be a weakening of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data, since such an inconsistency would create a situation of legal uncertainty.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all of the foregoing, the answer to the questions referred is that Article\u00a077(1), Article\u00a078(1) and Article\u00a079(1) of Regulation 2016/679, read in the light of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, must be interpreted as permitting the remedies provided for in Article\u00a077(1) and Article\u00a078(1) of that regulation, on the one hand, and Article\u00a079(1) thereof, on the other, to be exercised concurrently with and independently of each other. It is for the Member States, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy, to lay down detailed rules as regards the relationship between those remedies in order to ensure the effective protection of the rights guaranteed by that regulation and the consistent and homogeneous application of its provisions, as well as the right to an effective remedy before a court or tribunal as referred to in Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a077(1), Article\u00a078(1) and Article\u00a079(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), read in the light of Article\u00a047 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nmust be interpreted as permitting the remedies provided for in Article\u00a077(1) and Article\u00a078(1) of that regulation, on the one hand, and Article\u00a079(1) thereof, on the other, to be exercised concurrently with and independently of each other.

Docksey, acting as Agent, at the hearing on 18 June 2002,\nafter hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 14 November 2002,\ngives the following\nJudgment\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By orders of 12 December 2000 and 28 and 14 February 2001, the first of which was received at the Court on 28 December 2000 and the other two on 27 March 2001, the Verfassungsgerichtshof (Constitutional Court) (C-465/00) and the Oberster Gerichtshof (Supreme Court) (C-138/01 and C-139/01) each referred to the Court under Article 234 EC two questions, formulated in substantially the same way, on the interpretation of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L 281, p. 31). \n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those questions were raised in proceedings between, first, the Rechnungshof (Court of Audit) and a large number of bodies subject to its control and, second, Ms Neukomm and Mr Lauermann and their employer \u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk (\u0091\u00d6RF\u0092), a broadcasting organisation governed by public law, concerning the obligation of public bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof to communicate to it the salaries and pensions exceeding a certain level paid by them to their employees and pensioners together with the names of the recipients, for the purpose of drawing up an annual report to be transmitted to the Nationalrat, the Bundesrat and the Landtage (the lower and upper chambers of the Federal Parliament and the provincial assemblies) and made available to the general public (\u0091the Report\u0092). \n Legal context\nNational provisions\n \n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Paragraph 8 of the Bundesverfassungsgesetz \u00fcber die Begrenzung von Bez\u00fcgen \u00f6ffentlicher Funktion\u00e4re (Federal constitutional law on the limitation of salaries of public officials, BGBl. I 1997/64, as amended, \u0091the BezBegrBVG\u0092): \n\u00911.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof must, within the first three months of each second calendar year, inform the Rechnungshof of the salaries or pensions of persons who in at least one of the two previous calendar years drew salaries or pensions greater annually than 14 times 80% of the monthly reference amount under Paragraph 1 [for 2000, 14 times EUR 5 887.87]. The bodies must also state the salaries and pensions of persons who draw an additional salary or pension from a body subject to audit by the Rechnungshof. Persons who draw a salary or pension from two or more bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof must inform the bodies of this. If this duty of disclosure is not complied with by the body, the Rechnungshof must inspect the relevant documents and draw up its report on the basis thereof.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the application of subparagraph 1, social benefits and benefits in kind are also to be taken into account, unless they are benefits from sickness or accident insurance or on the basis of comparable provisions of \nLand\n law. Where several salaries or pensions are paid by bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof, they are to be aggregated.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Rechnungshof shall summarise that information - for each year separately - in a report. The report shall include all persons whose total yearly salaries and pensions from bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof exceed the amount stated in subparagraph 1. The report shall be transmitted to the Nationalrat, the Bundesrat and the Landtage.\u0092\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It appears from the orders of reference that, in the light of the \ntravaux pr\u00e9paratoires\n of the BezBegrBVG, legal commentators deduce from the latter provision that the Report must give the names of the persons concerned and against each name the amount of annual remuneration received. \n5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verfassungsgerichtshof states that, in accordance with the legislature's intention, the Report must be made available to the general public, so as to provide them with \u0091comprehensive information\u0092. It states that through this information pressure is brought to bear on the bodies concerned to keep salaries at a low level, so that public funds are used thriftily, economically and efficiently. \n6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bodies subject to audit by the Rechnungshof are the Federation, the \nL\u00e4nder\n (Federal provinces), large municipalities and - where a reasoned request has been made by the government of a \nLand\n - municipalities with fewer than 20 000 inhabitants, associations of municipalities, social security institutions, statutory professional bodies, \u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk, institutions, funds and foundations managed by organs of the Federation or the \nL\u00e4nder\n or by persons appointed by them for that purpose, and undertakings managed by the Federation, a \nLand\n or a municipality or (alone or jointly with other bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof) controlled through a company-law holding of not less than 50% or otherwise. \nCommunity legislation\n7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals 5 to 9 in the preamble to Directive 95/46 show that it was adopted on the basis of Article 100a of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 95 EC) to encourage the free movement of personal data through the harmonisation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of such data. \n8. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Article 1 of Directive 95/46: \n\u00911.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with this Directive, Member States shall protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall neither restrict nor prohibit the free flow of personal data between Member States for reasons connected with the protection afforded under paragraph 1.\u0092\n9. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this connection, recitals 2 and 3 of Directive 95/46 read as follows: \n\u0091(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas data-processing systems are designed to serve man; whereas they must, whatever the nationality or residence of natural persons, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, and contribute to economic and social progress, trade expansion and the well-being of individuals; \n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the establishment and functioning of an internal market in which, in accordance with Article 7a of the Treaty, the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured require not only that personal data should be able to flow freely from one Member State to another, but also that the fundamental rights of individuals should be safeguarded\u0092. \n10. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recital 10 of Directive 95/46 adds: \n\u0091(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the object of the national laws on the processing of personal data is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, which is recognised both in Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in the general principles of Community law; ...\u0092 \n 11. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article 6(1) of Directive 95/46, personal data (that is, in accordance with Article 2(a), \u0091any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u0092) must be: \n\u0091(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processed fairly and lawfully; \n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes ... \n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed; \n...\u0092\n12. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 2(b) of Directive 95/46 defines \u0091processing of personal data\u0092 as: \n\u0091any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction\u0092.\n13. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article 7 of Directive 95/46, personal data may be processed only if one of the six conditions it sets out is satisfied, and in particular if: \n\u0091(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; or \n...\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller ... to whom the data are disclosed\u0092. \n14. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to recital 72 of Directive 95/46, the directive allows for the principle of public access to official documents to be taken into account when implementing the principles set out in the directive. \n15. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the scope of Directive 95/46, Article 3(1) provides that it is to apply to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means, and to the processing otherwise than by automatic means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system. However, under Article 3(2), the directive \u0091shall not apply to the processing of personal data: \n -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union and in any case to processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the processing operation relates to State security matters) and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law; \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity\u0092. \n16. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Article 13 of Directive 95/46 authorises Member States to derogate from certain of its provisions, in particular Article 6(1), where this is necessary to safeguard \ninter alia\n \u0091an important economic or financial interest of a Member State or of the European Union, including monetary, budgetary and taxation matters\u0092 (Article 13(1)(e)) or \u0091a monitoring, inspection or regulatory function connected, even occasionally, with the exercise of official authority\u0092 in certain cases referred to, including that in subparagraph (e) (Article 13(1)(f)). \n The main proceedings and the questions referred for preliminary rulings\nCase C-465/00\n17. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Differences of opinion as to the interpretation of Paragraph 8 of the BezBegrBVG arose between the Rechnungshof and a large number of bodies under its control with respect to salaries and pensions paid in 1998 and 1999. \n18. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The defendants in the main proceedings, which include local and regional authorities (a \nLand\n and two municipalities), public undertakings, some of which are in competition with other Austrian or foreign undertakings not subject to control by the Rechnungshof, and a statutory professional body (Wirtschaftskammer Steiermark), did not communicate the data on the income of the employees in question, or communicated the data, to a greater or lesser extent, in anonymised form. They refused access to the relevant documents or made access subject to conditions which the Rechnungshof did not accept. The Rechnungshof therefore brought proceedings before the Verfassungsgerichtshof pursuant to Article 126a of the Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz (Federal Constitutional Law), which gives that court jurisdiction to rule on \u0091differences of opinion concerning the interpretation of the statutory provisions governing the jurisdiction of the Rechnungshof\u0092. \n19. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Rechnungshof infers from Paragraph 8 of the BezBegrBVG an obligation to list in the Report the names of the persons concerned and show their annual income. The defendants in the main proceedings take a different view and consider that they are not obliged to communicate personal data relating to that income, such as the names or positions of the persons concerned, with an indication of the emoluments received by them. They rely principally on Directive 95/46, Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed in Rome on 4 November 1950 (\u0091the Convention\u0092), which guarantees respect for private life, and on the argument that the obligation of publicity creates a barrier to the movement of workers, contrary to Article 39 EC. \n20. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verfassungsgerichtshof wishes essentially to know whether Paragraph 8 of the BezBegrBVG, as interpreted by the Rechnungshof, is compatible with Community law, so that it can interpret it consistently with Community law or declare it (partly) inapplicable, as the case may be. \n21. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It points out, in this connection, that the provisions of Directive 95/46, in particular Articles 6(1)(b) and (c) and 7(c) and (e), must be interpreted in the light of Article 8 of the Convention. It considers that comprehensive information for the public, as intended by the national legislature with respect to the income of employees of bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof whose annual remuneration exceeds a certain threshold (ATS 1 127 486 in 1999 and ATS 1 120 000 in 1998), has to be regarded as an interference with private life, which can be justified under Article 8(2) of the Convention only if that information contributes to the economic well-being of the country. An interference with fundamental rights cannot be justified by the existence of a mere \u0091public interest in information\u0092. The court doubts that the disclosure, by means of the Report, of data on personal income promotes the \u0091economic well-being of the country\u0092. In any event, it constitutes a disproportionate interference with private life. The audit carried out by the Rechnungshof is indubitably sufficient to ensure the proper use of public funds. \n22. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national court is also uncertain as to whether the scope of Community law varies according to the nature of the body which is required to contribute to the disclosure of the individual income of some of its employees. \n23. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Verfassungsgerichtshof decided to stay proceedings and refer the following two questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \n\u00911.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are the provisions of Community law, in particular those on data protection, to be interpreted as precluding national legislation which requires a State body to collect and transmit data on income for the purpose of publishing the names and income of employees of: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a regional or local authority, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a broadcasting organisation governed by public law, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a national central bank, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a statutory representative body, \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a partially State-controlled undertaking which is operated for profit? \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the answer to at least part of the above question is in the affirmative: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are the provisions precluding such national legislation directly applicable, in the sense that the persons obliged to make disclosure may rely on them to prevent the application of contrary national provisions?\u0092 \nCases C-138/01 and C-139/01\n24. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ms Neukomm and Mr Lauermann, who are employees of \u00d6RF, a body subject to control by the Rechnungshof, brought proceedings in the Austrian courts for interim orders to prevent \u00d6RF from acceding to the Rechnungshof's request to communicate data. \n25. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applications for interim orders were dismissed at first instance. The Arbeits- und Sozialgericht Wien (Labour and Social Court, Vienna) (Austria) (C-138/01), distinguishing between the transmission of the data to the Rechnungshof and its inclusion in the Report, considered that the Report had to be anonymous, while the mere transmission of the data to the Rechnungshof, even including names, did not infringe Article 8 of the Convention or Directive 95/46. The Landesgericht St P\u00f6lten (Regional Court, St P\u00f6lten) (Austria) (C-139/01), on the other hand, held that the inclusion of data with names in the Report was lawful, since an anonymised report would not enable the Rechnungshof to exercise adequate control. \n26. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Oberlandesgericht Wien (Higher Regional Court, Vienna) (Austria) upheld on appeal the dismissal of the applications for interim orders by the courts at first instance. While stating, in connection with Case C-138/01, that in communicating the data in question the employer is merely performing a task imposed on him by law and that the subsequent processing of the data by the Rechnungshof is not carried out under the control of the employer, the Oberlandesgericht held, in the context of Case C-139/01, that Paragraph 8 of the BezBegrBVG was consistent with fundamental rights and with Directive 95/46, even in the case of a list by name of the persons concerned. \n27. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ms Neukomm and Mr Lauermann appealed on a point of law (\nRevision\n) to the Oberster Gerichtshof. \n28. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Oberster Gerichtshof, referring to the reference for a preliminary ruling in Case C-465/00 and adopting the points of law raised by the Verfassungsgerichtshof, decided to stay proceedings and refer the following two questions to the Court, using the same wording in Cases C-138/01 and C-139/01: \n \u00911.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are the provisions of Community law, in particular those on data protection (Articles 1, 2, 6, 7 and 22 of Directive 95/46/EC in conjunction with Article 6 (formerly Article F) of the Treaty on European Union and Article 8 of the Convention), to be interpreted as precluding national legislation which requires a public broadcasting organisation, as a legal body, to communicate, and a State body to collect and transmit, data on income for the purpose of publishing the names and income of employees of a broadcasting organisation governed by public law? \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Court of Justice of the European Communities answers the above question in the affirmative: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are the provisions precluding national legislation of the kind described above directly applicable, in the sense that an organisation obliged to make disclosure may rely on them to prevent the application of contrary national legislation, and may not therefore rely on an obligation under national law against the employees concerned by the disclosure?\u0092 \n29. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By order of the President of the Court of 17 May 2001, Cases C-138/01 and C-139/01 were joined for the purposes of the written procedure, the oral procedure and judgment. Case C-465/00 and Cases C-138/01 and C-139/01 should also be joined for the purposes of judgment. \n30. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The questions put by the Verfassungsgerichtshof and the Oberster Gerichtshof are essentially the same, and should therefore be examined together. \n Applicability of Directive 95/46\n31. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To answer the questions as put would presuppose that Directive 95/46 is applicable in the main proceedings. That applicability is, however, disputed before the Court. This point must be decided as a preliminary issue. \nObservations submitted to the Court\n32. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The defendants in the main proceedings in Case C-465/00 consider essentially that the control activity exercised by the Rechnungshof falls within the scope of Community law and hence of Directive 95/46. In particular, in that it relates to the remuneration received by the employees of the bodies concerned, that activity touches aspects covered by Community provisions in social matters, such as Articles 136 EC, 137 EC and 141 EC, Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions (OJ 1976 L 39, p. 40), and Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community, as amended and updated by Council Regulation (EC) No 118/97 of 2 December 1996 (OJ 1997 L 28, p. 1). \n33. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They further submit that the control exercised by the Rechnungshof, first, affects the possibility for employees of the bodies concerned to seek employment in another Member State, because of the publicity attaching to their salaries which limits their power of negotiation with foreign companies, and, second, deters nationals of other Member States from seeking employment with the bodies subject to that control. \n34. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Austrian Airlines, \u00d6sterreichische Luftverkehrs-AG states that the interference with the freedom of movement of workers is particularly serious in its case because it competes with companies of other Member States which are not subject to such control. \n35. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Rechnungshof and the Austrian and Italian Governments, and to a certain extent the Commission, on the other hand, consider that Directive 95/46 is not applicable in the main proceedings. \n36. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Rechnungshof and the Austrian and Italian Governments, the control activity referred to in Paragraph 8 of the BezBegrBVG, which pursues objectives in the public interest in the field of public accounts, does not fall within the scope of Community law. \n37. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After observing that the directive, which was adopted on the basis of Article 100a of the Treaty, has the objective of establishing the internal market, an aspect of which is the protection of the right to privacy, the Rechnungshof and the Austrian and Italian Governments submit that the control in question is not such as to obstruct the freedom of movement of workers, since it does not in any way prevent the employees of the bodies concerned from going to work in another Member State or those of other Member States from working for those bodies. In any event, the link between the control activity and the freedom of movement of workers, even supposing that workers do seek to avoid working for a body subject to control by the Rechnungshof because of the publicity attaching to the salaries received, is too uncertain and indirect to constitute an infringement of freedom of movement and thereby to allow a link to be made with Community law. \n38. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission adopts a similar position. At the hearing, it nevertheless submitted that the collection of data by the bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof with a view to communication to the latter and inclusion in the report is itself within the scope of Directive 95/46. Collection serves not only the function of auditing but also, primarily, the payment of remuneration, which constitutes an activity covered by Community law, having regard to the existence of various relevant social provisions in the Treaty, such as Article 141 EC, and to the possible effect of that activity on the freedom of movement of workers. \nFindings of the Court\n39. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 95/46, adopted on the basis of Article 100a of the Treaty, is intended to ensure the free movement of personal data between Member States through the harmonisation of national provisions on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of such data. Article 1, which defines the object of the directive, provides in paragraph 2 that Member States may neither restrict nor prohibit the free flow of personal data between Member States for reasons connected with the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their private life, with respect to the processing of that data. \n40. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since any personal data can move between Member States, Directive 95/46 requires in principle compliance with the rules for protection of such data with respect to any processing of data as defined by Article 3. \n41. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It may be added that recourse to Article 100a of the Treaty as legal basis does not presuppose the existence of an actual link with free movement between Member States in every situation referred to by the measure founded on that basis. As the Court has previously held (see Case C-376/98 \nGermany\n v \nParliament and Council\n [2000] ECR I-8419, paragraph 85, and Case C-491/01 \nBritish American Tobacco (Investments) and Imperial Tobacco\n [2002] ECR I-11453, paragraph 60), to justify recourse to Article 100a of the Treaty as the legal basis, what matters is that the measure adopted on that basis must actually be intended to improve the conditions for the establishment and functioning of the internal market. In the present case, that fundamental attribute was never in dispute before the Court with respect to the provisions of Directive 95/46, in particular those in the light of which the national court raises the question of the compatibility of the national legislation in question with Community law. \n42. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the applicability of Directive 95/46 cannot depend on whether the specific situations at issue in the main proceedings have a sufficient link with the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty, in particular, in those cases, the freedom of movement of workers. A contrary interpretation could make the limits of the field of application of the directive particularly unsure and uncertain, which would be contrary to its essential objective of approximating the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States in order to eliminate obstacles to the functioning of the internal market deriving precisely from disparities between national legislations. \n43. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the applicability of Directive 95/46 to situations where there is no direct link with the exercise of the fundamental freedoms of movement guaranteed by the Treaty is confirmed by the wording of Article 3(1) of the directive, which defines its scope in very broad terms, not making the application of the rules on protection depend on whether the processing has an actual connection with freedom of movement between Member States. That is also confirmed by the exceptions in Article 3(2), in particular those concerning the processing of personal data \u0091in the course of an activity ... provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union\u0092 or \u0091in the course of a purely personal or household activity\u0092. Those exceptions would not, at the very least, be worded in that way if the directive were applicable exclusively to situations where there is a sufficient link with the exercise of freedoms of movement. \n44. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same observation may be made with regard to the exceptions in Article 8(2) of Directive 95/46, which concern the processing of specific categories of data, in particular those in Article 8(2)(d), which refers to processing carried out \u0091by a foundation, association or any other non-profit-seeking body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade-union aim\u0092. \n45. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings does not fall within the exception in the first indent of Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46. That processing does not concern the exercise of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union. Nor is it a processing operation concerning public security, defence, State security or the activities of the State in areas of criminal law. \n46. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The purposes set out in Articles 7(c) and (e) and 13(e) and (f) of Directive 95/46 show, moreover, that it is intended to cover instances of data processing such as those at issue in the main proceedings. \n47. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must therefore be considered that Directive 95/46 is applicable to the processing of personal data provided for by legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings. \n The first question\n48. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By their first question, the national courts essentially ask whether Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as precluding national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings which requires a State control body to collect and communicate, for purposes of publication, data on the income of persons employed by the bodies subject to that control, where that income exceeds a certain threshold. \nObservations submitted to the Court\n49. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Danish Government considers that Directive 95/46 does not, strictly speaking, govern the right of third parties to obtain access to documents on request. In particular, Article 12 of the directive refers only to the right of any person to obtain data concerning him. According to the Government, the protection of personal data which appear not to be sensitive must give way to the principle of transparency, which holds an essential place in the Community legal order. The Danish Government, with the Swedish Government, observes in this respect that, according to recital 72 of the directive, the principle of public access to official documents may be taken into account when implementing the directive. \n50. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Rechnungshof, the Austrian, Italian, Netherlands, Finnish and Swedish Governments and the Commission consider that the national provisions at issue in the main proceedings are compatible with Directive 95/46, by reason, generally, of the wide discretion the Member States have in implementing it, in particular where a task in the public interest provided for by law is to be carried out, under Articles 6(b) and (c) and 7(c) or (e) of the directive. Both the principles of transparency and of the proper management of public funds and the prevention of abuses are relied on in this respect. \n51. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those objectives in the public interest can justify an interference with private life, protected by Article 8(2) of the Convention, if it is in accordance with the law, is necessary in a democratic society for the pursuit of legitimate aims, and is not disproportionate to the objective pursued. \n52. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Austrian Government notes in particular that, when reviewing proportionality, the extent to which the data affect private life must be taken into account. Data relating to personal intimacy, health, family life or sexuality must therefore be protected more strongly than data relating to income and taxes, which, while also personal, concern personal identity to a lesser extent and are thereby less sensitive (see, to that effect, \nFressoz and Roire v. France\n [GC], no. 29183/95, \u00a7 65, ECHR 1999-I). \n53. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Finnish Government likewise considers that protection of private life is not absolute. Data relating to a person acting in the course of a public office or public functions relating thereto do not fall within the protection of private life. \n54. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Italian Government submits that data such as that at issue in the main proceedings are already by their nature public in most Member States, since they are visible from salary scales or remuneration brackets laid down by statute, regulation or collective agreements. In those circumstances, it is not contrary to the principle of proportionality to provide for diffusion of that data with the identities of the various people in receipt of the salaries in question. That diffusion, being thus intended to clarify a situation that is already apparent from data available to the public, constitutes the minimum measure which would ensure realisation of the objectives of transparency and sound administration. \n 55. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Netherlands Government adds, however, that the national courts must ascertain, for each public body concerned, whether the objective of public interest can be attained by processing the personal data in a way that interferes less with the private lives of the persons concerned. \n56. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United Kingdom Government submits that, in answering the first question, the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, proclaimed in Nice on 18 December 2000 (OJ 2000 C 364, p. 1), to which the Verfassungsgericht briefly refers, are of no relevance. \n57. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Cases C-138/01 and C-139/01, the Commission questions whether, in the context of examining proportionality under Article 6(1)(b) of Directive 95/46, it might not suffice for attaining the objective pursued by the BezBegrBVG to transmit the data in an anonymised form, for example by indicating the function of the person concerned rather than his name. Even if it is admitted that the Rechnungshof needs details of names in order to carry out a more exact check, it is questionable whether the inclusion of that data in the Report, giving the name of the person concerned, is really necessary for performing that check, especially as the Report is not only submitted to the parliamentary assemblies but must also be widely published. \n58. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the Commission observes that under Article 13 of Directive 95/46 the Member States may \ninter alia\n derogate from Article 6(1)(b) of the directive in order to safeguard a number of objectives in the public interest, in particular \u0091an important economic or financial interest of a Member State\u0092 (Article 13(1)(e)). However, in the Commission's view, the derogating measures must also comply with the principle of proportionality, which calls for the same considerations as those stated in the preceding paragraph with reference to Article 6(1)(b) of the directive. \n59. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The defendants in the main proceedings in Case C-465/00 consider that the national legislation at issue is incompatible with Article 6(1)(b) and (c) of Directive 95/46 and cannot be justified under Article 7(c) or (e) of the directive, since it constitutes an interference which is not justified under Article 8(2) of the Convention, and is in any event disproportionate. The audit performed by the Rechnungshof is sufficient to guarantee the thrifty use of public funds. \n60. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More particularly, it has not been shown that publication of the names and the amount of the income of all persons employed by public bodies where that amount exceeds a certain level constitutes a measure aimed at the economic well-being of the country. The aim of the legislature was to exert pressure on the bodies in question to maintain salaries at a low level. The defendants also submit that that measure is aimed, in the present case, at persons who for the most part are not public figures. \n61. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, even if the drawing up by the Rechnungshof of a report containing personal data on income intended for public debate were to be regarded as an interference with private life justified under Article 8(2) of the Convention, Land Nieder\u00f6sterreich and \u00d6RF consider that that measure also violates Article 14 of the Convention. Persons receiving the same income are treated unequally, depending on whether or not they are employed by a body subject to control by the Rechnungshof. \n62. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00d6RF points out a further example of unequal treatment that cannot be justified under Article 14 of the Convention. Among the employees of bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof, only those whose income exceeds the threshold fixed in Paragraph 8 of the BezBegrBVG have to suffer an interference with their private life. If the legislature attaches real importance to the reasonableness of the remuneration received by the employees of certain bodies, it is then necessary to publish the income of all employees, regardless of its amount. \n63. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, \u00d6RF, Marktgemeinde Kaltenleutgeben and Austrian Airlines, \u00d6sterreichische Luftverkehrs-AG submit that the wording of Paragraph 8 of the BezBegrBVG lends itself to an interpretation consistent with Community law, under which the salaries in question are required to be communicated to the Rechnungshof and included in the Report only in anonymised form. That interpretation should prevail, as it resolves the contradiction between that provision and Directive 95/46. \nFindings of the Court\n64. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted, to begin with, that the data at issue in the main proceedings, which relate both to the monies paid by certain bodies and the recipients, constitute personal data within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Directive 95/46, being \u0091information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u0092. Their recording and use by the body concerned, and their transmission to the Rechnungshof and inclusion by the latter in a report intended to be communicated to various political institutions and widely diffused, constitute processing of personal data within the meaning of Article 2(b) of the directive. \n65. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Directive 95/46, subject to the exceptions permitted under Article 13, all processing of personal data must comply, first, with the \u0091principles relating to data quality\u0092 set out in Article 6 of the directive and, second, with one of the \u0091criteria for making data processing legitimate\u0092 listed in Article 7. \n66. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, the data must be \u0091collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes\u0092 (Article 6(1)(b) of Directive 95/46) and must be \u0091adequate, relevant and not excessive\u0092 in relation to those purposes (Article 6(1)(c)). In addition, under Article 7(c) and (e) of the directive respectively, the processing of personal data is permissible only if it \u0091is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject\u0092 or \u0091is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller ... to whom the data are disclosed\u0092. \n67. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, under Article 13(e) and (f) of the directive, the Member States may derogate \ninter alia\n from Article 6(1) where this is necessary to safeguard respectively \u0091an important economic or financial interest of a Member State or of the European Union, including monetary, budgetary and taxation matters\u0092 or \u0091a monitoring, inspection or regulatory function connected, even occasionally, with the exercise of official authority\u0092 in particular cases including that referred to in subparagraph (e). \n68. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that the provisions of Directive 95/46, in so far as they govern the processing of personal data liable to infringe fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to privacy, must necessarily be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights, which, according to settled case-law, form an integral part of the general principles of law whose observance the Court ensures (see, \ninter alia\n, Case C-274/99 P \nConnolly\n v \nCommission\n [2001] ECR I-1611, paragraph 37). \n69. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those principles have been expressly restated in Article 6(2) EU, which states that \u0091[t]he Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the [Convention] and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.\u0092 \n70. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 95/46 itself, while having as its principal aim to ensure the free movement of personal data, provides in Article 1(1) that \u0091Member States shall protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data\u0092. Several recitals in its preamble, in particular recitals 10 and 11, also express that requirement. \n71. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it is to be noted that Article 8 of the Convention, while stating in paragraph 1 the principle that the public authorities must not interfere with the right to respect for private life, accepts in paragraph 2 that such an interference is possible where it is \u0091in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\u0092. \n72. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So, for the purpose of applying Directive 95/46, in particular Articles 6(1)(c), 7(c) and (e) and 13, it must be ascertained, first, whether legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings provides for an interference with private life, and if so, whether that interference is justified from the point of view of Article 8 of the Convention. \nExistence of an interference with private life\n 73. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, the collection of data by name relating to an individual's professional income, with a view to communicating it to third parties, falls within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention. The European Court of Human Rights has held in this respect that the expression \u0091private life\u0092 must not be interpreted restrictively and that \u0091there is no reason of principle to justify excluding activities of a professional ... nature from the notion of \u0093private life\u0094\u0092 (see, \ninter alia\n, \nAmann v. Switzerland\n [GC], no. 27798/95, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2000-II and \nRotaru v. Romania\n [GC], no. 28341/95, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-V). \n74. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It necessarily follows that, while the mere recording by an employer of data by name relating to the remuneration paid to his employees cannot as such constitute an interference with private life, the communication of that data to third parties, in the present case a public authority, infringes the right of the persons concerned to respect for private life, whatever the subsequent use of the information thus communicated, and constitutes an interference within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. \n75. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To establish the existence of such an interference, it does not matter whether the information communicated is of a sensitive character or whether the persons concerned have been inconvenienced in any way (see, to that effect, \nAmann v. Switzerland\n, \u00a7 70). It suffices to find that data relating to the remuneration received by an employee or pensioner have been communicated by the employer to a third party. \nJustification of the interference\n76. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An interference such as that mentioned in paragraph 74 above violates Article 8 of the Convention unless it is \u0091in accordance with the law\u0092, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims specified in Article 8(2), and is \u0091necessary in a democratic society\u0092 for achieving that aim or aims. \n77. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is common ground that the interference at issue in the main proceedings is in accordance with Paragraph 8 of the BezBegrBVG. However, the question arises whether that paragraph is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to adjust his conduct accordingly, and so complies with the requirement of foreseeability laid down in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (see, \ninter alia\n, \nRekv\u00e9nyi v. Hungary\n [GC], no. 25390/94, \u00a7 34, ECHR 1999-III). \n78. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, Paragraph 8(3) of the BezBegrBVG states that the report drawn up by the Rechnungshof is to \u0091include all persons whose total yearly salaries and pensions from bodies ... exceed the amount stated in subparagraph 1\u0092, without expressly requiring the names of the persons concerned to be disclosed in relation to the income they receive. According to the orders for reference, it is legal commentators who, on the basis of the \ntravaux pr\u00e9paratoires\n, interpret the constitutional law in that way. \n79. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for the national courts to ascertain whether the interpretation to the effect that Paragraph 8(3) of the BezBegrBVG requires disclosure of the names of the persons concerned in relation to the income received complies with the requirement of foreseeability referred to in paragraph 77 above. \n80. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, that question need not arise until it has been determined whether such an interpretation of the national provision at issue is consistent with Article 8 of the Convention, as regards its required proportionality to the aims pursued. That question will be examined below. \n81. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It appears from the order for reference in Case C-465/00 that the objective of Paragraph 8 of the BezBegrBVG is to exert pressure on the public bodies concerned to keep salaries within reasonable limits. The Austrian Government observes, more generally, that the interference provided for by that provision is intended to guarantee the thrifty and appropriate use of public funds by the administration. Such an objective constitutes a legitimate aim within the meaning both of Article 8(2) of the Convention, which mentions the \u0091economic well-being of the country\u0092, and Article 6(1)(b) of Directive 95/46, which refers to \u0091specified, explicit and legitimate purposes\u0092. \n82. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must next be ascertained whether the interference in question is necessary in a democratic society to achieve the legitimate aim pursued. \n83. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the European Court of Human Rights, the adjective \u0091necessary\u0092 in Article 8(2) of the Convention implies that a \u0091pressing social need\u0092 is involved and that the measure employed is \u0091proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued\u0092 (see, \ninter alia\n, the Gillow v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 November 1986, Series A no. 109, \u00a7 55). The national authorities also enjoy a margin of appreciation, \u0091the scope of which will depend not only on the nature of the legitimate aim pursued but also on the particular nature of the interference involved\u0092 (see the Leander v. Sweden judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, \u00a7 59). \n84. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The interest of the Republic of Austria in ensuring the best use of public funds, and in particular keeping salaries within reasonable limits, must be balanced against the seriousness of the interference with the right of the persons concerned to respect for their private life. \n85. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the one hand, in order to monitor the proper use of public funds, the Rechnungshof and the various parliamentary bodies undoubtedly need to know the amount of expenditure on human resources in the various public bodies. In addition, in a democratic society, taxpayers and public opinion generally have the right to be kept informed of the use of public revenues, in particular as regards expenditure on staff. Such information, put together in the Report, may make a contribution to the public debate on a question of general interest, and thus serves the public interest. \n86. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question nevertheless arises whether stating the names of the persons concerned in relation to the income received is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons relied on before the Court to justify such disclosure appear relevant and sufficient. \n87. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is plain that, according to the interpretation adopted by the national courts, Paragraph 8 of the BezBegrBVG requires disclosure of the names of the persons concerned, in relation to income above a certain level, with respect not only to persons filling posts remunerated by salaries on a published scale, but to all persons remunerated by bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof. Moreover, such information is not only communicated to the Rechnungshof and via the latter to the various parliamentary bodies, but is also made widely available to the public. \n88. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for the national courts to ascertain whether such publicity is both necessary and proportionate to the aim of keeping salaries within reasonable limits, and in particular to examine whether such an objective could not have been attained equally effectively by transmitting the information as to names to the monitoring bodies alone. Similarly, the question arises whether it would not have been sufficient to inform the general public only of the remuneration and other financial benefits to which persons employed by the public bodies concerned have a contractual or statutory right, but not of the sums which each of them actually received during the year in question, which may depend to a varying extent on their personal and family situation. \n89. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect, on the other hand, to the seriousness of the interference with the right of the persons concerned to respect for their private life, it is not impossible that they may suffer harm as a result of the negative effects of the publicity attached to their income from employment, in particular on their prospects of being given employment by other undertakings, whether in Austria or elsewhere, which are not subject to control by the Rechnungshof. \n90. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be concluded that the interference resulting from the application of national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings may be justified under Article 8(2) of the Convention only in so far as the wide disclosure not merely of the amounts of the annual income above a certain threshold of persons employed by the bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof but also of the names of the recipients of that income is both necessary for and appropriate to the aim of keeping salaries within reasonable limits, that being a matter for the national courts to examine. \nConsequences with respect to the provisions of Directive 95/46\n \n91. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the national courts conclude that the national legislation at issue is incompatible with Article 8 of the Convention, that legislation is also incapable of satisfying the requirement of proportionality in Articles 6(1)(c) and 7(c) or (e) of Directive 95/46. Nor could it be covered by any of the exceptions referred to in Article 13 of that directive, which likewise requires compliance with the requirement of proportionality with respect to the public interest objective being pursued. In any event, that provision cannot be interpreted as conferring legitimacy on an interference with the right to respect for private life contrary to Article 8 of the Convention. \n92. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, on the other hand, the national courts were to consider that Paragraph 8 of the BezBegrBVG is both necessary for and appropriate to the public interest objective being pursued, they would then, as appears from paragraphs 77 to 79 above, still have to ascertain whether, by not expressly providing for disclosure of the names of the persons concerned in relation to the income received, Paragraph 8 of the BezBegrBVG complies with the requirement of foreseeability. \n93. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, it should be noted, in the light of the above considerations, that the national court must also interpret any provision of national law, as far as possible, in the light of the wording and the purpose of the applicable directive, in order to achieve the result pursued by the latter and thereby comply with the third paragraph of Article 249 EC (see Case C-106/89 \nMarleasing\n [1990] ECR I-4135, paragraph 8). \n94. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the above considerations, the answer to the first question must be that Articles 6(1)(c) and 7(c) and (e) of Directive 95/46 do not preclude national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, provided that it is shown that the wide disclosure not merely of the amounts of the annual income above a certain threshold of persons employed by the bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof but also of the names of the recipients of that income is necessary for and appropriate to the objective of proper management of public funds pursued by the legislature, that being for the national courts to ascertain. \n The second question\n95. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By their second question, the national courts ask whether the provisions of Directive 95/46 which preclude national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings are directly applicable, in that they may be relied on by individuals before the national courts to oust the application of that legislation. \n96. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The defendants in the main proceedings in Case C-465/00 and the Netherlands Government consider that Articles 6(1) and 7 of Directive 95/46 fulfil the criteria stated in the Court's case-law for having such direct effect. They are sufficiently precise and unconditional for the bodies required to disclose the data relating to the income of the persons concerned to be able to rely on them to prevent application of the national provisions contrary to those provisions. \n97. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Austrian Government submits, on the other hand, that the relevant provisions of Directive 95/46 are not directly applicable. In particular, Articles 6(1) and 7 are not unconditional, since their implementation requires the Member States, which have a wide discretion, to adopt special measures to that effect. \n98. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On this point, it should be noted that wherever the provisions of a directive appear, so far as their subject-matter is concerned, to be unconditional and sufficiently precise, they may, in the absence of implementing measures adopted within the prescribed period, be relied on against any national provision which is incompatible with the directive or in so far as they define rights which individuals are able to assert against the State (see, \ninter alia\n, Case 8/81 \nBecker\n [1982] ECR 53, paragraph 25, and Case C-141/00 \nK\u00fcgler\n [2002] ECR I-6833, paragraph 51). \n99. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the answer to the first question, the second question seeks to know whether such a character may be attributed to Article 6(1)(c) of Directive 95/46, under which \u0091personal data must be ... adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed\u0092, and to Article 7(c) or (e), under which personal data may be processed only if \ninter alia\n \u0091processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject\u0092 or \u0091is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller ... to whom the data are disclosed\u0092. \n100. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those provisions are sufficiently precise to be relied on by individuals and applied by the national courts. Moreover, while Directive 95/46 undoubtedly confers on the Member States a greater or lesser discretion in the implementation of some of its provisions, Articles 6(1)(c) and 7(c) or (e) for their part state unconditional obligations. \n101. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the second question must therefore be that Articles 6(1)(c) and 7(c) and (e) of Directive 95/46 are directly applicable, in that they may be relied on by an individual before the national courts to oust the application of rules of national law which are contrary to those provisions. \n Costs\n102. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The costs incurred by the Austrian, Danish, Italian, Netherlands, Finnish, Swedish and United Kingdom Governments and by the Commission, which have submitted observations to the Court, are not recoverable. Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the proceedings pending before the national courts, the decisions on costs are a matter for those courts. \n \nOn those grounds,\nTHE COURT,\nin answer to the questions referred to it by the Verfassungsgerichtshof by order of 12 December 2000 and by the Oberster Gerichtshof by orders of 14 and 28 February 2001, hereby rules:\n 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 6(1)(c) and 7(c) and (e) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data do not preclude national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, provided that it is shown that the wide disclosure not merely of the amounts of the annual income above a certain threshold of persons employed by the bodies subject to control by the Rechnungshof but also of the names of the recipients of that income is necessary for and appropriate to the objective of proper management of public funds pursued by the legislature, that being for the national courts to ascertain. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 6(1)(c) and 7(c) and (e) of Directive 95/46 are directly applicable, in that they may be relied on by an individual before the national courts to oust the application of rules of national law which are contrary to those provisions. \nRodr\u00edguez IglesiasPuissochet Wathelet \nSchintgenGulmann Edward \nLa PergolaJann Skouris \nMackenColneric von Bahr \nCunha Rodrigues \nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 20 May 2003.\nR.

The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 27 Oct 2022, C-129/21 (\nProximus\n)\nE-privacy Directive \n > \nDirectories of

informed indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed.\u2019\n\u00a0\nDirective 2002/58\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a010, 17, 38 and 39 of Directive 2002/58 are worded as follows:\n\u2018(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the electronic communications sector, Directive 95/46/EC applies in particular to all matters concerning protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, which are not specifically covered by the provisions of this Directive, including the obligations on the controller and the rights of individuals.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(17)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the purposes of this Directive, consent of a user or subscriber, regardless of whether the latter is a natural or a legal person, should have the same meaning as the data subject\u2019s consent as defined and further specified in Directive 95/46/EC. Consent may be given by any appropriate method enabling a freely given specific and informed indication of the user\u2019s wishes, including by ticking a box when visiting an Internet website.\n\u2026\n(38)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directories of subscribers to electronic communications services are widely distributed and public. The right to privacy of natural persons and the legitimate interest of legal persons require that subscribers are able to determine whether their personal data are published in a directory and if so, which. Providers of public directories should inform the subscribers to be included in such directories of the purposes of the directory and of any particular usage which may be made of electronic versions of public directories especially through search functions embedded in the software, such as reverse search functions enabling users of the directory to discover the name and address of the subscriber on the basis of a telephone number only.\n(39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The obligation to inform subscribers of the purpose(s) of public directories in which their personal data are to be included should be imposed on the party collecting the data for such inclusion. Where the data may be transmitted to one or more third parties, the subscriber should be informed of this possibility and of the recipient or the categories of possible recipients. Any transmission should be subject to the condition that the data may not be used for other purposes than those for which they were collected. If the party collecting the data from the subscriber or any third party to whom the data have been transmitted wishes to use the data for an additional purpose, the renewed consent of the subscriber is to be obtained either by the initial party collecting the data or by the third party to whom the data have been transmitted.\u2019\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01 of that directive provides:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive provides for the harmonisation of the national provisions required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy and confidentiality, with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic communication sector and to ensure the free movement of such data and of electronic communication equipment and services in the Community.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provisions of this Directive particularise and complement Directive 95/46/EC for the purposes mentioned in paragraph\u00a01.

Not being included in a public subscriber directory, verifying, correcting or withdrawing personal data from it shall be free of charge.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States may require that for any purpose of a public directory other than the search of contact details of persons on the basis of their name and, where necessary, a minimum of other identifiers, additional consent be asked of the subscribers.\n\u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe GDPR\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a042, 66 and 173 of the GDPR state:\n\u2018(42)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where processing is based on the data subject\u2019s consent, the controller should be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration on another matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact that and the extent to which consent is given.\u00a0\u2026 a declaration of consent pre-formulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language and it should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended. Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.\n\u2026\n(66)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To strengthen the right to be forgotten in the online environment, the right to erasure should also be extended in such a way that a controller who has made the personal data public should be obliged to inform the controllers which are processing such personal data to erase any links to, or copies or replications of those personal data.

Pursuant to Article\u00a045(3) thereof, those operators are to keep separate the data relating to subscribers who have indicated that they do not wish to be included in a directory so as to allow those subscribers to receive the directory without their data being included therein.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proximus, a telecommunications service provider in Belgium, also provides publicly available telephone directories and directory enquiry services (\u2018directories\u2019) in accordance with the provisions of the Law on electronic communication. Those directories contain the name, address and telephone number (\u2018contact details\u2019) of the subscribers of the various providers of publicly available telephone services (\u2018operators\u2019). There are other directories that are published by third parties.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The contact details of the subscribers concerned are regularly communicated to Proximus by the operators, with the exception of those subscribers who have expressed the wish not to be included in the directories published by Proximus. In Belgium, the distinction between subscribers who wish to appear in a directory and those who do not leads, in practice, to the assignment of a code in the record of each subscriber, namely \u2018NNNNN\u2019 for subscribers whose contact details may appear and \u2018XXXXX\u2019 for subscribers whose contact details are to remain confidential. Proximus also supplies the contact details that it receives to another provider of directories.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The complainant is a subscriber of the telephone service operator, Telenet, which is active on the Belgian market. Telenet does not provide directories, rather it supplies the contact details of its subscribers to providers of directories, inter alia to Proximus.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 13\u00a0January 2019, the complainant asked Proximus not to include his contact details in directories published both by Proximus and by third parties. Following that request, Proximus changed that subscriber\u2019s status in its computer system so that his contact details would no longer be made public.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 31\u00a0January 2019, Proximus received from Telenet a routine update of the data of the latter\u2019s subscribers. That update contained new data for the complainant, which were not indicated as being confidential. That information was processed automatically by Proximus and was recorded, with the result that it was again included in the latter\u2019s directories.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 14\u00a0August 2019, having realised that his telephone number had been published in the directories of Proximus and of third parties, the subscriber concerned again asked Proximus not to include his data in the directories. On the same date, Proximus replied to the complainant that it had withdrawn his data from the directories and contacted Google to have the relevant links to Proximus\u2019 website deleted. Proximus also informed that subscriber that it had forwarded his contact details to other providers of directories and that, via the monthly updates, those providers had been informed of the complainant\u2019s request.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, the subscriber concerned submitted a complaint to the DPA against Proximus on the ground that, despite his request for his contact details not to be included in the directories, his telephone number was nevertheless included in some of those directories.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 5\u00a0September 2019, the complainant and Proximus had further exchanges concerning the publication of that subscriber\u2019s data in the directory of a third party. In that context, Proximus stated that it forwards the contact details of its subscribers to other providers of directories, but that it is not in any way privy to the internal procedures of those providers.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 30\u00a0July 2020, after hearing both parties, the Geschillenkamer (Litigation Chamber) adopted a decision by which it ordered Proximus to take remedial action and to pay a fine of EUR\u00a020\u00a0000 for infringement, inter alia, of Article\u00a06 of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article\u00a07 thereof, and of Article\u00a05(2) of that regulation, read in conjunction with Article\u00a024 thereof. In particular, it first ordered Proximus to respond appropriately and immediately to the withdrawal of consent by the subscriber concerned and to comply with the requests of that subscriber seeking to exercise his right to erasure of the data concerning him. It then ordered Proximus to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that the processing of personal data that it performs complies with the provisions of the GDPR. Lastly, it ordered Proximus to cease unlawfully passing on the data concerned to other providers of directories.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 28\u00a0August 2020, Proximus brought an action against that decision before the hof van beroep te Brussel (Court of Appeal, Brussels).\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Proximus\u2019 view, in accordance with Article\u00a045(3) of the Law on electronic communication, the consent of the subscriber is not required, rather subscribers must themselves request not to be included in the directories under an \u2018opt-out\u2019 system. In the absence of such a request, the subscriber concerned may in fact be included in those directories. Accordingly, in Proximus\u2019 view, no \u2018consent\u2019 within the meaning of Directive 95/46 or within the meaning of the GDPR is, in the present case, required from the subscriber.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking the opposite view, the DPA contended, in essence, that Article\u00a012(2) of Directive 2002/58 and Article\u00a0133(1) of the Law on electronic communication require the \u2018consent of subscribers\u2019, within the meaning of the GDPR, in order for the providers of directories to be able to process and pass on their personal data.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court considers that Directive 2002/58 constitutes a \nlex specialis\n in relation to the GDPR, as is confirmed by recital\u00a0173 and Article\u00a095 of the GDPR. Consequently, in the situations in which Directive 2002/58 further specifies the GDPR rules, the specific provisions of that directive prevail as \nlex specialis\n over the more general provisions of the GDPR.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the referring court observes that Article\u00a012(2) of Directive 2002/58 and Article\u00a0133(1) of the Law on electronic communication, while requiring an expression of the subscribers\u2019 wishes in order for the providers of directories to be able to process their personal data, do not specify whether that expression of wishes must take the form of the exercise of a right of option, as Proximus maintains, or of the indication of genuine consent within the meaning of the GDPR, as stated by the DPA. On that point, the referring court notes that the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular the judgment of 5\u00a0May 2011, \nDeutsche Telekom\n (C-543/09, EU:C:2011:279, paragraph\u00a061), established that\u00a0\u2013 as follows from a contextual and systematic interpretation of Article\u00a012 of Directive 2002/58\u00a0\u2013 the expression of wishes at issue corresponds to \u2018consent\u2019 in relation to the purpose of the publication of personal data in a public directory and not to the identity of any particular directory provider.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, given that no specific rules have been drawn up concerning the withdrawal by a subscriber of that expression of wishes or of that \u2018consent\u2019, neither in Directive 2002/58, nor in the Law on electronic communication, nor in an implementing decree, the referring court asks whether all the provisions of the GDPR must apply automatically and without any restrictions also in the particular context of telephone directories.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the hof van beroep te Brussel (Court of Appeal, Brussels) decided to stay the proceedings and refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article\u00a012(2) of [Directive 2002/58], read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(f) thereof and Article\u00a095 of the [GDPR] be interpreted as permitting a national supervisory authority to require a subscriber\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d within the meaning of the [GDPR] as the basis for the publication of the subscriber\u2019s personal data in public directories and directory enquiry services, published both by the operator itself and by third-party providers, in the absence of national legislation to the contrary?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the right to erasure contained in Article\u00a017 of the [GDPR] be interpreted as precluding a national supervisory authority from categorising a request by a subscriber to be removed from public directories and directory enquiry services as a request for erasure within the meaning of Article\u00a017 of the [GDPR]?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article\u00a024 and Article\u00a05(2) of the [GDPR] be interpreted as precluding a national supervisory authority from concluding from the obligation of accountability laid down therein that the controller must take appropriate technical and organisational measures to inform third-party controllers, namely, the telephone service provider and other providers of directories and directory enquiry services which have received data from that first controller, of the withdrawal of the data subject\u2019s consent in accordance with Article\u00a06 in conjunction with Article\u00a07 of the [GDPR]?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Article\u00a017(2) of the [GDPR] be interpreted as precluding a national supervisory authority from ordering a provider of public directories and directory enquiry services which has been requested to cease disclosing data relating to an individual to take reasonable steps to inform search engines of that request for erasure?\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proximus submits that the case in the main proceedings does not concern the publication by a telephone service operator of directories containing personal data, with the result that the first question referred for a preliminary ruling should be considered inadmissible in so far as it concerns such a situation.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with settled case-law, questions on the interpretation of EU law referred by a national court in the factual and legislative context which that court is responsible for defining, and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court to determine, enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 1\u00a0August 2022, \nVyriausioji tarnybin\u0117s etikos komisija\n, C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601, paragraph\u00a048 and the case-law cited).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the dispute in the main proceedings is solely between a natural person and a company which is not his telephone service operator, regarding the manner in which that company processed the personal data of that person in the context of the publication of directories. It follows that the first question is inadmissible in so far as it seeks an interpretation of the requirements arising from Article\u00a012(2) of Directive 2002/58 for the situation in which it is the telephone service operator of the person concerned that itself publishes his or her personal data in directories.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that, by its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a012(2) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with point (f) of the second paragraph of Article\u00a02 of that directive and with Article\u00a095 of the GDPR, must be interpreted as meaning that \u2018consent\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(11) of the GDPR is required from the subscriber of a telephone service operator in order for that subscriber\u2019s personal data to be included in directories published by providers other than that operator.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer that question, it should be borne in mind that Article\u00a01(1) of Directive 2002/58 provides, inter alia, for the harmonisation of the national provisions required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy and confidentiality, with regard to the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that it is clear from Article\u00a012(1) and recital\u00a038 of that directive that, before being included in public directories, subscribers are to be informed of the purposes of the directory and of any particular usage which may be made of it, in particular through search functions embedded in the software of the electronic versions of the directories.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recital\u00a039 of Directive 2002/58 further states, with respect to the obligation of prior information for subscribers under Article\u00a012(1) thereof: \u2018where the [personal] data may be transmitted to one or more third parties, the subscriber should be informed of this possibility and of the recipient or the categories of possible recipients\u2019.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After obtaining the information referred to in Article\u00a012(1) of Directive 2002/58, the subscriber may\u00a0\u2013 as is clear from Article\u00a012(2) thereof\u00a0\u2013 decide whether his or her personal data are to be included in a public directory and, if so, which personal data.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has already held, such prior information gives the subscriber concerned the opportunity to give consent to the publication of his or her personal data in public directories, such consent being necessary for the purposes of such a publication (see, to that effect, judgment of 5\u00a0May 2011, \nDeutsche Telekom\n, C-543/09, EU:C:2011:279, paragraphs\u00a054 and 58).\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The requirement to obtain the consent of the subscriber concerned for the purposes of publishing those data in directories is confirmed in Article\u00a012(3) of Directive 2002/58, according to which Member States may require that for any purpose of a public directory other than the search of contact details of persons on the basis of their name, \u2018additional consent be asked of the subscribers\u2019.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as the Court has stated, it follows from a contextual and systematic interpretation of Article\u00a012 of Directive 2002/58 that the consent under Article\u00a012(2) relates to the purpose of the publication of personal data in a public directory and not to the identity of any particular directory provider. Accordingly, where the subscriber concerned has consented to his or her data being published in a directory with a specific purpose, he or she will generally not have standing to object to the publication of the same data in another, similar directory (judgment of 5\u00a0May 2011, \nDeutsche Telekom\n, C-543/09, EU:C:2011:279, paragraphs\u00a061 and 62).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, recital\u00a039 of Directive 2002/58 confirms that the passing of subscribers\u2019 personal data to third parties is \u2018subject to the condition that the data may not be used for other purposes than those for which they were collected\u2019.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that where a subscriber has been informed by a telephone service operator, such as Telenet, of the possibility that his or her personal data may be passed to a third-party undertaking, such as Proximus or other third parties, with a view to being published in a public directory, and where that subscriber has consented to the publication of those data in such a directory, renewed consent is not needed from the subscriber concerned for the passing of those same data by that operator or by that undertaking to another undertaking which intends to publish a printed or electronic public directory, or to make such directories available for consultation through directory enquiry services, if it is guaranteed that the data in question will not be used for purposes other than those for which the data were collected with a view to their first publication. The consent given under Article\u00a012(2) of Directive 2002/58, by a subscriber who has been duly informed, to the publication of his or her personal data in a public directory relates to the purpose of that publication and thus extends to any subsequent processing of those data by third-party undertakings active in the market for publicly available directory enquiry services and directories, provided that such processing pursues that same purpose (judgment of 5\u00a0May 2011, \nDeutsche Telekom\n, C-543/09, EU:C:2011:279, paragraph\u00a065).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as stated in recital\u00a039 of that directive, if the party collecting the data from the subscriber or any third party to whom the data have been transmitted wishes to use the data for an additional purpose, the renewed consent of the subscriber is to be obtained either by the initial party collecting the data or by the third party to whom the data have been transmitted.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the manner in which such consent must be indicated, it follows from point (f) of the second paragraph of Article\u00a02 of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a094(2) and Article\u00a095 of the GDPR, that such consent must, in principle, meet the requirements under Article\u00a04(11) of that regulation.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, Article\u00a04(11) of the GDPR, which constitutes the provision applicable to the facts at issue in the main proceedings, defines the \u2018consent of the data subject\u2019 as requiring a \u2018freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous\u2019 indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes in the form of a statement or of \u2018a clear affirmative action\u2019 signifying agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that such consent is necessary in order for the personal data relating to the subscriber of a telephone service operator to be included in directories.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the publication of the personal data relating to the subscriber in question in directories such as those published by Proximus or by other providers can be regarded as lawful within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(a) of the GDPR only if such consent exists, having been expressly given to the telephone service operator or to one of those providers of directories.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as has been noted in paragraph\u00a049 above, such consent does not presuppose that, on the date on which it is given, the data subject is necessarily aware of the identity of all the providers of directories which will process his or her personal data.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a012(2) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with point (f) of the second paragraph of Article\u00a02 thereof and with Article\u00a095 of the GDPR, must be interpreted as meaning that \u2018consent\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(11) of the GDPR is required from the subscriber of a telephone service operator in order for the personal data of that subscriber to be included in directories published by providers other than that operator, and that that consent may be provided to that operator or to one of those providers.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a017 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the request by a subscriber to have his or her personal data withdrawn from directories constitutes making use of the \u2018right to erasure\u2019 within the meaning of that article.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should first of all be noted that Proximus submits that Article\u00a017 of the GDPR is not applicable to a provider of directories which, as in the present case, is not the subscriber\u2019s telephone service operator and that a request, such as that referred to in the preceding paragraph, should, at most, have to be regarded as constituting a request for rectification within the meaning of Article\u00a016 of that regulation. Accordingly, the second question referred for a preliminary ruling is inadmissible in that it is irrelevant to the case in the main proceedings.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the arguments put forward by that party relate, in essence, to the field of application and scope, and therefore to the interpretation, of the provisions of EU law to which the second question relates. Such arguments, which concern the substance of the question referred, cannot therefore, by their very nature, lead to the inadmissibility of the question (judgment of 13\u00a0January 2022, \nMinister Sprawiedliwo\u015bci\n, C-55/20, EU:C:2022:6, paragraph\u00a083).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the second question referred for a preliminary ruling is admissible.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it should be noted that, under the second sentence of Article\u00a012(2) of Directive 2002/58, subscribers must have, inter alia, the opportunity to have the personal data relating to them withdrawn from public directories.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the grant of such an opportunity to subscribers does not constitute, as regards the providers of directories, a specific obligation, within the meaning of Article\u00a095 of the GDPR, which would make it possible to exclude the application of the relevant provisions of that regulation. As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point\u00a054 of his Opinion, Directive 2002/58 does not contain any indications as to the modalities, implementation and consequences of requests to obtain the withdrawal of personal data. Accordingly, as is apparent, moreover, from recital\u00a010 of that directive, read in conjunction with Article\u00a094 of the GDPR, the provisions of the GDPR may be applied in such a situation.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it follows from Article\u00a017(1)(b) and (d) of the GDPR that the data subject is to have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her and that the controller is to have the obligation to erase those data without undue delay, inter alia where the data subject \u2018withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article\u00a06(1)\u00a0\u2026 and where there is no other legal ground for the processing\u2019 or even where \u2018the personal data have been unlawfully processed\u2019.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, first, it follows from the answer to the first question referred for a preliminary ruling that the publication of a subscriber\u2019s personal data in directories is based on that subscriber\u2019s consent.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, it is apparent from Article\u00a06(1)(a) and Article\u00a07(3) of the GDPR that such consent constitutes one of the necessary conditions for a finding that the processing of the personal data of the subscriber concerned is lawful, and that that consent may be withdrawn at any time and in a manner which is as easy as that which enabled the data subject to give such consent.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, when the subscriber requests that his or her data no longer be included in a directory, he or she is withdrawing his or her consent to the publication of those data. On the basis of the withdrawal of his or her consent, he or she obtains, in the absence of another legal ground for such processing, the right to request the erasure of his or her personal data from that directory pursuant to Article\u00a017(1)(b) of the GDPR or, where the controller continues to publish those data unlawfully, pursuant to Article\u00a017(1)(d) of that regulation.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it must be concluded that the request by a subscriber to have his or her personal data withdrawn from directories may be regarded as making use of the \u2018right to erasure\u2019 of those data within the meaning of Article\u00a017 of the GDPR.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion cannot be called into question by Proximus\u2019 argument that such a request should be regarded as seeking to allow that subscriber to exercise his or her right to obtain from the controller the rectification of the personal data concerning him or her, pursuant to Article\u00a016 of the GDPR. Under that provision, such a rectification is possible where those data are inaccurate and is intended to allow the data subject to have those data completed.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in the present case, a request for withdrawal of a subscriber\u2019s data contained in a directory does not seek to replace inaccurate data with correct data or to complete incomplete data, but to withdraw the publication of correct data.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that such a withdrawal takes the form, in the present case, of the mere adjustment of the code assigned to the subscriber concerned in Proximus\u2019 database\u00a0\u2013 from which that subscriber\u2019s personal data are published in the directories\u00a0\u2013 cannot prevent a request for withdrawal of personal data contained in those directories from being regarded as a \u2018request for erasure\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a017 of the GDPR. As is apparent from the documents before the Court, the method of withdrawal provided for by the operator in question constitutes a purely technical or organisational measure which proves necessary to respond to the request for erasure of the data subject\u2019s personal data and to prevent the disclosure of those data.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a017 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the request by a subscriber to have his or her personal data withdrawn from directories constitutes making use of the \u2018right to erasure\u2019 within the meaning of that article.\n\u00a0\nThe third question\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a05(2) and Article\u00a024 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that a national supervisory authority may require that a provider of directories, as controller, take appropriate technical and organisational measures to inform third-party controllers, namely the telephone service operator which has communicated its subscriber\u2019s personal data to that provider and the other providers of directories to which that provider has itself supplied such data, of the withdrawal of the subscriber\u2019s consent.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, in the present case, Proximus processed personal data of the complainant by publishing them and by communicating them to other providers of directories. Telenet, the complainant\u2019s telephone service operator, also processed those data, inter alia by passing them on to Proximus. The same is true of the other providers of directories that received the complainant\u2019s contact details from Proximus and that published them.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it should be noted, first, that, as has been pointed out in paragraph\u00a020 above, although the Law on electronic communication requires telephone service operators to pass on the data relating to their subscribers to providers of public directories, those operators must, however, keep separate the data relating to subscribers who have indicated that they do not wish to be included in a directory so as to allow those subscribers to receive a copy of that directory without their data being included therein.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the documents before the Court that, in practice, it is usually to his or her telephone service operator that the subscriber gives his or her consent to the publication of his or her personal data in a directory, such consent making it possible for those data to be transferred to a third-party provider of directories. That provider may, in turn, communicate such data to other providers of directories on the basis of the same consent, those controllers thus constituting a chain in which each in turn processes the data in question independently on the basis of one and the same consent.\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, it is also apparent from the documents before the Court that the update of Proximus\u2019 database, which was intended to give effect to the withdrawal of the complainant\u2019s consent, was erased as soon as the complainant\u2019s telephone service operator sent Proximus a new list of data relating to its subscribers\u00a0\u2013 for the purposes of publication of those data in the directories\u00a0\u2013 which did not take into account the fact that the complainant had notified Proximus of the withdrawal of his consent.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the question thus arises whether a provider of directories such as Proximus, when a subscriber of a telephone service operator withdraws his or her consent to be included in the directories of that provider, must not only update its own database to take account of that withdrawal, but must also notify the withdrawal both to the telephone service operator which has communicated the data concerned to that provider and also to the other providers of directories to which that provider has itself forwarded such data.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it should be recalled that Article\u00a06(1)(a) of the GDPR provides that processing is to be lawful only if and to the extent that the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes. However, it is apparent from the order for reference that the complainant withdrew his consent, within the meaning of Article\u00a07(3) of that regulation, to the processing of his personal data for the purposes of their publication in directories. Following such a withdrawal, the processing of those data for the purposes of their inclusion in public directories, including that performed for the same purpose by the telephone service operators or by other providers of directories on the basis of the same consent, no longer has any legal ground and is thus unlawful in the light of Article\u00a06(1)(a) of the GDPR.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it should be recalled that, in accordance with Article\u00a05(1)(a) and (2) of the GDPR, the controller must ensure that it is able to demonstrate that personal data are processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards Article\u00a024 of the GDPR, that provision requires that, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, the controller implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with that regulation.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a067 of his Opinion, Article\u00a05(2) and Article\u00a024 of the GDPR impose general accountability and compliance requirements upon controllers of personal data. In particular, those provisions require controllers to take appropriate steps to prevent any infringements of the rules laid down in the GDPR in order to ensure the right to the protection of data.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From that point of view, Article\u00a019 of the GDPR provides, inter alia, that the controller is to communicate any erasure of personal data carried out in accordance with Article\u00a017(1) of that regulation to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the general obligations laid down in Article\u00a05(2) and Article\u00a024 of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article\u00a019 thereof, that a controller of personal data, such as Proximus, must, by means of appropriate technical and organisational measures, inform the other providers of directories that have received such data from it of the withdrawal of the data subject\u2019s consent addressed to it. In circumstances such as those set out in paragraph\u00a076 above, such a controller must also ensure that the telephone service operator that has communicated those personal data to it is informed so that that operator amends the list of personal data that it automatically forwards to that provider of directories and keeps separate the data of its subscribers who have indicated their wish to withdraw their consent to those data being made public.\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where, as in the present case, various controllers rely on the single consent of the data subject in order to process his or her personal data for the same purpose, it is sufficient, in order for that data subject to withdraw such consent, that he or she contacts, for the purposes of the withdrawal requested, any one of the controllers which rely on that same consent.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Commission correctly observes, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the right of the data subject to withdraw his or her consent provided for in Article\u00a07(3) of the GDPR and to ensure that the data subject\u2019s consent is strictly linked to the purpose for which it was given, the controller to which the data subject has notified the withdrawal of his or her consent to the processing of his or her personal data is in fact required to communicate that withdrawal to any person who has forwarded those data to it and to the person to whom it has, in turn, forwarded those data. The controllers thus informed are then, in turn, obliged to forward that information to the other controllers to which they have communicated such data.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should, first of all, be noted that such an information obligation is intended to prevent any possible infringement of the rules laid down in the GDPR in order to ensure the right to the protection of data and thus forms part of the appropriate measures within the meaning of Article\u00a024 of that regulation. Furthermore, as the Advocate General stated in point\u00a068 of his Opinion, it also forms part of the requirement laid down in Article\u00a012(2) of the GDPR, pursuant to which the controller must facilitate the exercise of the rights conferred on the data subject, inter alia, by Article\u00a017 of that regulation.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, it must be found that the absence of such an obligation on the controller to communicate the withdrawal of the data subject\u2019s consent could make the withdrawal of consent particularly difficult, since that data subject might consider himself or herself required to contact each of the operators. Such an approach would thus be contrary to Article\u00a07(3) of the GDPR, which provides that it must be as easy to withdraw, as to give, consent to the processing of personal data.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraph\u00a049 above, the consent given under Article\u00a012(2) of Directive 2002/58, by a subscriber who has been duly informed, to the publication of his or her personal data in a public directory relates to the purpose of that publication and thus extends to any subsequent processing of those data by third-party undertakings active in the market for directories, provided that such processing pursues that same purpose.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a068 of his Opinion, since a provider of directories may rely on the consent given by a subscriber, to the processing of data for that same purpose, to another provider or to his or her telephone service operator, it must be possible for a subscriber, in order to withdraw consent, to contact any one of the providers of directories or that telephone service operator with a view to his or her contact details being withdrawn from directories published by all of those who rely upon his or her single expression of consent.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the third question is that Article\u00a05(2) and Article\u00a024 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that a national supervisory authority may require that the provider of directories, as controller, take appropriate technical and organisational measures to inform third-party controllers, namely the telephone service operator which has communicated its subscriber\u2019s personal data to that provider and the other providers of directories to which that provider has itself supplied such data, of the withdrawal of the subscriber\u2019s consent.\n\u00a0\nThe fourth question\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a017(2) of the GDPR must be interpreted as precluding a national supervisory authority from ordering a provider of directories\u00a0\u2013 which has been requested by the subscriber of a telephone service operator to cease disclosing personal data relating to him or her\u00a0\u2013 to take \u2018reasonable steps\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, to inform search engine providers of that request for erasure of the data.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer that question, it should be borne in mind that Article\u00a017(2) of the GDPR imposes the obligation on the controller which has made the personal data public, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, to take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from recital\u00a066 of the GDPR, the objective of that obligation is to strengthen the right to be forgotten in the online environment, and therefore specifically applies to information made available on the internet by search engine providers that process data published online.\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is common ground that Proximus published, in its directory, the complainant\u2019s personal data and, therefore, that that company must be regarded as a controller which has made such data public within the meaning of Article\u00a017(2) of the GDPR.\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it must be borne in mind, first, that, in accordance with settled case-law, the activity of a search engine consisting in finding information published or placed on the internet by third parties, indexing it automatically, storing it temporarily and, finally, making it available to internet users according to a particular order of preference must be classified as \u2018processing\u2019 of personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of the GDPR when that information contains personal data and, second, that the operator of that search engine must be regarded as the \u2018controller\u2019 in respect of that processing, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(7), and therefore also of Article\u00a017(2), of that regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0September 2019, \nGC and Others (De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, EU:C:2019:773, paragraph\u00a035 and the case-law cited).\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, it must be concluded that a controller such as Proximus is required, under Article\u00a017(2) of the GDPR, to ensure that reasonable steps are taken to inform search engine providers of the request addressed to it by the subscriber of a telephone service operator for erasure of his or her personal data. However, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a076 of his Opinion, in order to assess the reasonableness of the steps taken by the provider of directories, Article\u00a017(2) of the GDPR provides that the available technology and the cost of implementation must be taken into account, a task that falls primarily upon the authority competent for such matters, subject to judicial review.\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the written observations lodged by the DPA, which have not been challenged on that point by the other parties to the present proceedings, that, during the second quarter of 2020, there were a limited number of search engine providers operating in Belgium. In particular, Google had a market share of between 90%, as regards desktop searches, and 99%, as regards smartphone and tablet searches.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, as stated in paragraph\u00a026 above, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that, in response to the subscriber\u2019s request for his data not to be included in the directories of that provider, Proximus stated that it had not only withdrawn those data from the telephone directories and from the directory enquiry services, but that it had also contacted Google to have the relevant links to Proximus\u2019 website deleted.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the fourth question is that Article\u00a017(2) of the GDPR must be interpreted as not precluding a national supervisory authority from ordering a provider of directories\u00a0\u2013 which has been requested by the subscriber of a telephone service operator to cease disclosing personal data relating to him or her\u00a0\u2013 to take \u2018reasonable steps\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, to inform search engine providers of that request for erasure of the data.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a012(2) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009, read in conjunction with point (f) of the second paragraph of Article\u00a02 of that directive and with Article\u00a095 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation),\nmust be interpreted as meaning that \u2018consent\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(11) of that regulation is required from the subscriber of a telephone service operator in order for the personal data of that subscriber to be included in publicly available telephone directories and directory enquiry services published by providers other than that operator, and that that consent may be provided to that operator or to one of those providers.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a017 of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that the request by a subscriber to have his or her personal data withdrawn from publicly available telephone directories and directory enquiry services constitutes making use of the \u2018right to erasure\u2019 within the meaning of that article.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a05(2) and Article\u00a024 of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that a national supervisory authority may require that the provider of publicly available telephone directories and directory enquiry services, as controller, take appropriate technical and organisational measures to inform third-party controllers, namely the telephone service operator that has communicated its subscriber\u2019s personal data to that provider and the other providers of publicly available telephone directories and directory enquiry services to which that provider has itself supplied such data, of the withdrawal of the subscriber\u2019s consent.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a017(2) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as not precluding a national supervisory authority from ordering a provider of publicly available telephone directories and directory enquiry services\u00a0\u2013 which has been requested by the subscriber of a telephone service operator to cease disclosing personal data relating to him or her\u00a0\u2013 to take \u2018reasonable steps\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, to inform search engine providers of that request for erasure of the data."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The controller or processor shall ensure that any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests.\u2019\n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a039 of the GDPR, entitled \u2018Tasks of the [DPO]\u2019, reads as follows:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The [DPO] shall have at least the following tasks:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to inform and advise the controller or the processor and the employees who carry out processing of their obligations pursuant to this Regulation and to other Union or Member State data protection provisions;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to monitor compliance with this Regulation, with other Union or Member State data protection provisions and with the policies of the controller or processor in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing operations, and the related audits;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to provide advice where requested as regards the data protection impact assessment and monitor its performance pursuant to Article\u00a035;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to cooperate with the supervisory authority;\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to act as the contact point for the supervisory authority on issues relating to processing, including the prior consultation referred to in Article\u00a036, and to consult, where appropriate, with regard to any other matter.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The [DPO] shall in the performance of his or her tasks have due regard to the risk associated with processing operations, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing.\u2019\n\u00a0\nGerman law\n\u00a0\nThe BDSG\n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph\u00a06 of the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (Federal Law on data protection) of 20\u00a0December 1990 (BGBl. 1990 I, p.\u00a02954), in the version in force from 25\u00a0May 2018 until 25\u00a0November 2019 (BGBl. 2017 I, p.\u00a02097) (\u2018the BDSG\u2019), entitled \u2018Position\u2019, provides in subparagraph 4:\n\u2018The dismissal of the [DPO] shall be permitted only by applying Paragraph\u00a0626 of the B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch (Civil Code) in the version of 2\u00a0January 2002 (BGBl. 2002 I, p.\u00a042, corrigenda BGBl. 2002 I, p.\u00a02909, and BGBl. 2003 I, p.\u00a0738) accordingly.

That period starts to run when the person entitled to terminate becomes aware of the facts serving as the basis for termination.\u00a0\u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FC is employed by X-FAB as from 1\u00a0November 1993.\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He performs the duties of chair of the works council in that company and, on that basis, is released from some of his work obligations. He also holds the role of vice-chair of the central works council which was established for three undertakings in the group of companies to which X-FAB belongs, which are established in Germany.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With effect from 1\u00a0June 2015, FC was appointed, by each undertaking separately, as the DPO of X-FAB, its parent company and the other subsidiaries of the parent company established in Germany. According to the referring court, the aim of that appointment in parallel of FC as the DPO of all those undertakings was to ensure a uniform level of data protection in those undertakings.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the request of the state officer for data protection and freedom of information of Th\u00fcringen (Germany), X-FAB and the undertakings referred to in paragraph\u00a012 of the present judgment, by letters dated 1\u00a0December 2017, dismissed FC with immediate effect from his duties as DPO. By separate letters of 25\u00a0May 2018, those undertakings, as a precautionary measure, repeated their dismissal of FC, based on the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR, which had in the intervening period become applicable, relying on grounds linked to the group of companies to which X-FAB belongs.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The action brought by FC before the German courts seeks a declaration that he retains the position of DPO of X-FAB. X-FAB submits that there is a risk of a conflict of interests if FC simultaneously performs the functions of DPO and chair of the works council, on the ground that those two posts are incompatible. There is, therefore, a just cause justifying FC\u2019s dismissal as DPO.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The courts of first instance and of appeal upheld FC\u2019s action. The appeal on a point of law (\nRevision\n) brought by X-FAB before the Bundesarbeitsgericht (Federal Labour Court, Germany), which is the referring court, seeks to have that action dismissed.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court observes that the outcome of that appeal depends on the interpretation of EU law. In particular, the question arises, first, whether the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR precludes the legislation of a Member State from making the dismissal of a DPO subject to stricter conditions than those laid down by EU law and, if so, whether that provision has sufficient legal basis. Should the Court find that the conditions to which the BDSG makes the dismissal subject do comply with EU law, it would be necessary to determine whether the functions of chair of the works council and of DPO of that undertaking may be performed by one and the same person or whether that would give rise to a conflict of interests within the meaning of the second sentence of Article\u00a038(6) of the GDPR.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances the Bundesarbeitsgericht (Federal Labour Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of [the GDPR] to be interpreted as precluding a provision in national law, such as, in the present case, Paragraph\u00a038(1) and (2) in conjunction with the first sentence of Paragraph\u00a06(4) of the [BDSG], which makes dismissal of the [DPO] by the controller, who is his employer, subject to certain conditions set out therein, irrespective of whether such dismissal relates to the performance of his tasks?\nIf the first question is answered in the affirmative:\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) GDPR also preclude such a provision in national law if the designation of the [DPO] is mandatory not in accordance with Article\u00a037(1) GDPR, but only in accordance with the law of the Member State?\nIf the first question is answered in the affirmative:\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR have sufficient legal basis, in particular in so far as it covers [DPOs] that have an employment relationship with the controller?\nIf the first question is answered in the negative:\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is there a conflict of interests within the meaning of the second sentence of Article\u00a038(6) of the GDPR if the [DPO] also holds the office of [chair] of the works council established at the controlling body? Must specific tasks have been assigned within the works council in order for such a conflict of interests to be assumed to exist?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which provides that a controller or a processor may dismiss a DPO who is a member of staff of that controller or processor solely where there is just cause, even if the dismissal is not related to the performance of that officer\u2019s tasks.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is clear from settled case-law, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary to consider not only its wording, by considering the latter\u2019s usual meaning in everyday language, but also the context in which the provision occurs and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2022,\n Leistritz\n, C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraph\u00a018 and the case-law cited).\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, as regards the wording of the provision at issue, it must be stated that the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR provides that \u2018he or she shall not be dismissed or penalised by the controller or the processor for performing his [or her] tasks\u2019.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in its judgment of 22\u00a0June 2022,\n Leistritz\n (C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraphs\u00a020 and 21), the Court, after observing that the GDPR does not define the terms \u2018dismissed\u2019, \u2018penalised\u2019 and \u2018for performing his [or her] tasks\u2019 in the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR, stated, first, that, in accordance with the meaning which those words have in everyday language, the prohibition of the dismissal, by a controller or processor, of a DPO or of the imposition, by a controller or processor, of a penalty on him or her means that that DPO must be protected against any decision terminating his or her duties, by which he or she would be placed at a disadvantage or which would constitute a penalty.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A dismissal measure in respect of a DPO taken by his or her employer and resulting in the DPO being dismissed by the controller or its processor is capable of constituting such a decision.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as the Court has also stated, the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR applies without distinction both to the DPO who is a member of the staff of the controller or processor and to the person who fulfils the tasks on the basis of a service contract concluded with the latter, in accordance with Article\u00a037(6) of the GDPR, with the result that the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) is intended to apply to relationships between a DPO and a controller or processor, irrespective of the nature of the relationship between that DPO and the latter (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2022,\n Leistritz\n, C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraphs\u00a023 and 24).\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the latter provision imposes a limit which consists in prohibiting the dismissal of a DPO on a ground relating to the performance of his or her tasks, which include, in particular, under Article\u00a039(1)(b) of the GDPR, monitoring compliance with EU or Member State legal provisions on data protection and with the policies of the controller or processor concerning the protection of personal data (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2022, \nLeistritz\n, C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraph\u00a025).\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards the objective pursued by the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR, first, recital\u00a097 of that regulation states that data protection officers, whether or not they are employees of the controller, should be in a position to perform their duties and tasks in an independent manner. In that regard, such independence must necessarily enable them to carry out those tasks in accordance with the objective of the GDPR, which seeks, inter alia, as is apparent from recital\u00a010 thereof, to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union and, to that end, to ensure a consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of such natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2022, \nLeistritz\n, C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraph\u00a026 and the case-law cited).\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the objective of ensuring the functional independence of the DPO, as it follows from the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR, is also apparent from the first and third sentences of that provision, which require that that DPO is not to receive any instructions regarding the exercise of those tasks and is to report directly to the highest level of management of the controller or processor, and from Article\u00a038(5), which provides that, with regard to that exercise, that DPO is to be bound by secrecy or confidentiality (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2022, \nLeistritz\n, C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraph\u00a027).\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR, by protecting the DPO against any decision which terminates his or her duties, places him or her at a disadvantage or constitutes a penalty, where such a decision relates to the performance of his or her tasks, must be regarded as seeking essentially to preserve the functional independence of the DPO and, therefore, to ensure that the provisions of the GDPR are effective (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2022, \nLeistritz\n, C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraph\u00a028).\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has also held, that interpretation is supported, in the third place, by the context of that provision and, in particular, by the legal basis on which the EU legislature adopted the GDPR (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2022, \nLeistritz\n, C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraph\u00a029).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from the preamble to the GDPR, that regulation was adopted on the basis of Article\u00a016 TFEU, paragraph\u00a02 of which provides, in particular, that the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union are, by means of regulations, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, to lay down the rules relating, first, to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of EU law and, second, to the free movement of such data (judgment of 22\u00a0June 2022, \nLeistritz\n, C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraph\u00a030).\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the laying down of rules on protection against the dismissal of a DPO employed by a controller or by a processor falls within the scope of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data solely inasmuch as such rules are intended to preserve the functional independence of the latter, in accordance with the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2022, \nLeistritz\n, C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraph\u00a031).\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that each Member State is free, in the exercise of its retained competence, to lay down more protective specific provisions on the dismissal of the DPO, in so far as those provisions are compatible with EU law and, in particular, with the provisions of the GDPR, particularly the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) thereof (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2022, \nLeistritz\n, C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraph\u00a034).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, such increased protection cannot undermine the achievement of the objectives of the GDPR. That would be the case if it prevented any dismissal, by a controller or by a processor, of a DPO who no longer possesses the professional qualities required to perform his or her tasks, in accordance with Article\u00a037(5) of the GDPR, or who does not fulfil those tasks in accordance with the provisions of that regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2022, \nLeistritz\n, C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraph\u00a035).\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled, as has been noted in paragraph\u00a025 of the present judgment, that the GDPR seeks to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union with regard to the processing of their personal data, and that, in order to achieve that objective, the DPO must be in a position to perform his or her duties and tasks in an independent manner.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, increased protection for the DPO which would prevent the dismissal of the DPO in the event that he or she is not, or is no longer, in a position to carry out his or her tasks in an independent manner on account of there being a conflict of interests would undermine the achievement of that objective.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for the national court to satisfy itself that specific provisions such as those referred to in paragraph\u00a031 of the present judgment are compatible with EU law and, in particular, with the provisions of the GDPR.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that the second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of the GDPR must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which provides that a controller or a processor may dismiss a DPO who is a member of staff of that controller or processor solely where there is just cause, even if the dismissal is not related to the performance of that DPO\u2019s tasks, in so far as such legislation does not undermine the achievement of the objectives of the GDPR.\n\u00a0\nThe second and third questions\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the answer given to the first question, there is no need to answer the second and third questions.\n\u00a0\nThe fourth question\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, the referring court asks, in essence, in which circumstances may the existence of a \u2018conflict of interests\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a038(6) of the GDPR, be established.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, in the first place, the wording of the provision at issue, it should be noted that, as set out in the second sentence of Article\u00a038(6) of the GDPR, \u2018the [DPO] may fulfil other tasks and duties. The controller or processor shall ensure that any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests\u2019.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It thus follows from the wording of that provision, first, that the GDPR does not establish that there is a fundamental incompatibility between, on the one hand, the performance of DPO\u2019s duties and, on the other hand, the performance of other duties within the controller or processor. Article\u00a038(6) of that regulation specifically provides that the DPO may be entrusted with performing tasks and duties other than those for which it is responsible under Article\u00a039 of the GDPR.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact remains, second, that the controller or its processor must ensure that those other tasks and duties do not give rise to a \u2018conflict of interests\u2019. In the light of the meaning of those words in everyday language, it must be held that, in accordance with the objective pursued by Article\u00a038(6) of the GDPR, the DPO cannot be entrusted with performing tasks or duties which could impair the execution of the functions performed by the DPO.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards that objective, it should, in the second place, be noted that that provision is, in essence, intended, as are the other provisions referred to in paragraph\u00a025 of the present judgment, to preserve the functional independence of the DPO and, consequently, to ensure the effectiveness of the provisions of the GDPR.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, as regards the context of which Article\u00a038(6) of the GDPR forms part, it should be noted that, according to Article\u00a039(1)(b) of the GDPR, the task of the DPO is, inter alia, to monitor compliance with the GDPR, other provisions of EU law or of the law of the Member States on data protection and the policies of the controller or processor in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing operations, and the related audits.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows, in particular, that a DPO cannot be entrusted with tasks or duties which would result in him or her determining the objectives and methods of processing personal data on the part of the controller or its processor. Under EU law or the law of the Member States on data protection, the review of those objectives and methods must be carried out independently by the DPO.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The determination of the existence of a conflict of interests, within the meaning of Article\u00a038(6) of the GDPR, must be carried out, case by case, on the basis of an assessment of all the relevant circumstances, in particular the organisational structure of the controller or its processor and in the light of all the applicable rules, including any policies of the controller or its processor.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the fourth question is that Article\u00a038(6) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that a \u2018conflict of interests\u2019, as provided for in that provision, may exist where a DPO is entrusted with other tasks or duties, which would result in him or her determining the objectives and methods of processing personal data on the part of the controller or its processor, which is a matter for the national court to determine, case by case, on the basis of an assessment of all the relevant circumstances, in particular the organisational structure of the controller or its processor and in the light of all the applicable rules, including any policies of the controller or its processor.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Sixth Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe second sentence of Article\u00a038(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which provides that a controller or a processor may dismiss a data protection officer who is a member of staff of that controller or processor solely where there is just cause, even if the dismissal is not related to the performance of that officer\u2019s tasks, in so far as such legislation does not undermine the achievement of the objectives of that regulation.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a038(6) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that a \u2018conflict of interests\u2019, as provided for in that provision, may exist where a data protection officer is entrusted with other tasks or duties, which would result in him or her determining the objectives and methods of processing personal data on the part of the controller or its processor, which is a matter for the national court to determine, case by case, on the basis of an assessment of all the relevant circumstances, in particular the organisational structure of the controller or its processor and in the light of all the applicable rules, including any policies of the controller or its processor."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Sif Tynes, acting as Agent, at the hearing on 30 April 2002,\nafter hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 19 September 2002,\ngives the following\nJudgment\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By order of 23 February 2001, received at the Court on 1 March 2001, the G\u00f6ta hovr\u00e4tt (G\u00f6ta Court of Appeal) referred to the Court for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC seven questions concerning inter alia the interpretation of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L 281, p. 31). \n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those questions were raised in criminal proceedings before that court against Mrs Lindqvist, who was charged with breach of the Swedish legislation on the protection of personal data for publishing on her internet site personal data on a number of people working with her on a voluntary basis in a parish of the Swedish Protestant Church. \n Legal background\nCommunity legislation\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 95/46 is intended, according to the terms of Article 1(1), to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data. \n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 3 of Directive 95/46 provides, regarding the scope of the directive: \n\u00911. This Directive shall apply to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means, and to the processing otherwise than by automatic means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.\n2. This Directive shall not apply to the processing of personal data:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union and in any case to processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the processing operation relates to State security matters) and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law, \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity.\u0092 \n5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 8 of Directive 95/46, entitled \u0091The processing of special categories of data\u0092, provides: \n\u00911. Member States shall prohibit the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life.\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply where:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the data subject has given his explicit consent to the processing of those data, except where the laws of the Member State provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject's giving his consent; or \n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and specific rights of the controller in the field of employment law in so far as it is authorised by national law providing for adequate safeguards; or \n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving his consent; or \n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate guarantees by a foundation, association or any other non-profit-seeking body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade-union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the data are not disclosed to a third party without the consent of the data subjects; or \n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the processing relates to data which are manifestly made public by the data subject or is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. \n3. Paragraph 1 shall not apply where processing of the data is required for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment or the management of health-care services, and where those data are processed by a health professional subject under national law or rules established by national competent bodies to the obligation of professional secrecy or by another person also subject to an equivalent obligation of secrecy.\n4. Subject to the provision of suitable safeguards, Member States may, for reasons of substantial public interest, lay down exemptions in addition to those laid down in paragraph 2 either by national law or by decision of the supervisory authority.\n5. Processing of data relating to offences, criminal convictions or security measures may be carried out only under the control of official authority, or if suitable specific safeguards are provided under national law, subject to derogations which may be granted by the Member State under national provisions providing suitable specific safeguards. However, a complete register of criminal convictions may be kept only under the control of official authority.\nMember States may provide that data relating to administrative sanctions or judgements in civil cases shall also be processed under the control of official authority.\n6. Derogations from paragraph 1 provided for in paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be notified to the Commission.\n7. Member States shall determine the conditions under which a national identification number or any other identifier of general application may be processed.\u0092\n6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 9 of Directive 95/46, entitled \u0091Processing of personal data and freedom of expression\u0092, provides: \n\u0091Member States shall provide for exemptions or derogations from the provisions of this Chapter, Chapter IV and Chapter VI for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression only if they are necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression.\u0092\n7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 13 of Directive 95/46, entitled \u0091Exemptions and restrictions\u0092, provides that Member States may adopt measures restricting the scope of some of the obligations imposed by the directive on the controller of the data, inter alia as regards information given to the persons concerned, where such a restriction is necessary to safeguard, for example, national security, defence, public security, an important economic or financial interest of a Member State or of the European Union, or the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or of breaches of ethics for regulated professions. \n8. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 25 of Directive 95/46, which is part of Chapter IV entitled \u0091Transfer of personal data to third countries\u0092, reads as follows:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n\u00911. The Member States shall provide that the transfer to a third country of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer may take place only if, without prejudice to compliance with the national provisions adopted pursuant to the other provisions of this Directive, the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection.\n2. The adequacy of the level of protection afforded by a third country shall be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or set of data transfer operations; particular consideration shall be given to the nature of the data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations, the country of origin and country of final destination, the rules of law, both general and sectoral, in force in the third country in question and the professional rules and security measures which are complied with in that country.\n3. The Member States and the Commission shall inform each other of cases where they consider that a third country does not ensure an adequate level of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2.\n4. Where the Commission finds, under the procedure provided for in Article 31(2), that a third country does not ensure an adequate level of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article, Member States shall take the measures necessary to prevent any transfer of data of the same type to the third country in question.\n5. At the appropriate time, the Commission shall enter into negotiations with a view to remedying the situation resulting from the finding made pursuant to paragraph 4.\n6. The Commission may find, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 31(2), that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article, by reason of its domestic law or of the international commitments it has entered into, particularly upon conclusion of the negotiations referred to in paragraph 5, for the protection of the private lives and basic freedoms and rights of individuals.\nMember States shall take the measures necessary to comply with the Commission's decision.\u0092\n9. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the time of the adoption of Directive 95/46, the Kingdom of Sweden made the following statement on the subject of Article 9, which was entered in the Council minutes (document No 4649/95 of the Council, of 2 February 1995): \n\u0091The Kingdom of Sweden considers that artistic and literary expression refers to the means of expression rather than to the contents of the communication or its quality.\u0092\n 10. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed at Rome on 4 November 1950 (\u0091the ECHR\u0092), provides, in Article 8, for a right to respect for private and family life and, in Article 10, contains provisions concerning freedom of expression. \nThe national legislation\n11. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 95/46 was implemented in Swedish law by the Personuppgiftslag (SFS 1998:204) (Swedish law on personal data, \u0091the PUL\u0092). \n The main proceedings and the questions referred\n12. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to her job as a maintenance worker, Mrs Lindqvist worked as a catechist in the parish of Alseda (Sweden). She followed a data processing course on which she had inter alia to set up a home page on the internet. At the end of 1998, Mrs Lindqvist set up internet pages at home on her personal computer in order to allow parishioners preparing for their confirmation to obtain information they might need. At her request, the administrator of the Swedish Church's website set up a link between those pages and that site. \n13. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The pages in question contained information about Mrs Lindqvist and 18 colleagues in the parish, sometimes including their full names and in other cases only their first names. Mrs Lindqvist also described, in a mildly humorous manner, the jobs held by her colleagues and their hobbies. In many cases family circumstances and telephone numbers and other matters were mentioned. She also stated that one colleague had injured her foot and was on half-time on medical grounds. \n14. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs Lindqvist had not informed her colleagues of the existence of those pages or obtained their consent, nor did she notify the Datainspektionen (supervisory authority for the protection of electronically transmitted data) of her activity. She removed the pages in question as soon as she became aware that they were not appreciated by some of her colleagues. \n15. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The public prosecutor brought a prosecution against Mrs Lindqvist charging her with breach of the PUL on the grounds that she had: \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processed personal data by automatic means without giving prior written notification to the Datainspektionen (Paragraph 36 of the PUL); \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0processed sensitive personal data (injured foot and half-time on medical grounds) without authorisation (Paragraph 13 of the PUL); \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0transferred processed personal data to a third country without authorisation (Paragraph 33 of the PUL). \n \n16. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs Lindqvist accepted the facts but disputed that she was guilty of an offence. Mrs Lindqvist was fined by the Eksj\u00f6 tingsr\u00e4tt (District Court) (Sweden) and appealed against that sentence to the referring court. \n17. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The amount of the fine was SEK 4 000, which was arrived at by multiplying the sum of SEK 100, representing Mrs Lindqvist's financial position, by a factor of 40, reflecting the severity of the offence. Mrs Lindqvist was also sentenced to pay SEK 300 to a Swedish fund to assist victims of crimes. \n18. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As it had doubts as to the interpretation of the Community law applicable in this area, inter alia Directive 95/46, the G\u00f6ta hovr\u00e4tt decided to stay proceedings and refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: \n\u0091(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is the mention of a person - by name or with name and telephone number - on an internet home page an action which falls within the scope of [Directive 95/46]? Does it constitute \u0093the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means\u0094 to list on a self-made internet home page a number of persons with comments and statements about their jobs and hobbies etc.? \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the answer to the first question is no, can the act of setting up on an internet home page separate pages for about 15 people with links between the pages which make it possible to search by first name be considered to constitute \u0093the processing otherwise than by automatic means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system\u0094 within the meaning of Article 3(1)? \nIf the answer to either of those questions is yes, the hovr\u00e4tt also asks the following questions:\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can the act of loading information of the type described about work colleagues onto a private home page which is none the less accessible to anyone who knows its address be regarded as outside the scope of [Directive 95/46] on the ground that it is covered by one of the exceptions in Article 3(2)? \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is information on a home page stating that a named colleague has injured her foot and is on half-time on medical grounds personal data concerning health which, according to Article 8(1), may not be processed? \n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Directive 95/46] prohibits the transfer of personal data to third countries in certain cases. If a person in Sweden uses a computer to load personal data onto a home page stored on a server in Sweden - with the result that personal data become accessible to people in third countries - does that constitute a transfer of data to a third country within the meaning of the directive? Would the answer be the same even if, as far as known, no one from the third country had in fact accessed the data or if the server in question was actually physically in a third country? \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can the provisions of [Directive 95/46], in a case such as the above, be regarded as bringing about a restriction which conflicts with the general principles of freedom of expression or other freedoms and rights, which are applicable within the EU and are enshrined in inter alia Article 10 of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms? \nFinally, the hovr\u00e4tt asks the following question:\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can a Member State, as regards the issues raised in the above questions, provide more extensive protection for personal data or give it a wider scope than the directive, even if none of the circumstances described in Article 13 exists?\u0092 \n The first question\n19. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks whether the act of referring, on an internet page, to various persons and identifying them by name or by other means, for instance by giving their telephone number or information regarding their working conditions and hobbies, constitutes \u0091the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means\u0092 within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 95/46. \nObservations submitted to the Court\n20. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs Lindqvist submits that it is unreasonable to take the view that the mere mention by name of a person or of personal data in a document contained on an internet page constitutes automatic processing of data. On the other hand, reference to such data in a keyword in the \u0091meta tags\u0092 of an internet page, which makes it possible to create an index and find that page using a search engine, might constitute such processing. \n21. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Swedish Government submits that the term \u0091the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means\u0092 in Article 3(1) of Directive 95/46, covers all processing in computer format, in other words, in binary format. Consequently, as soon as personal data are processed by computer, whether using a word processing programme or in order to put them on an internet page, they have been the subject of processing within the meaning of Directive 95/46. \n22. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Netherlands Government submits that personal data are loaded onto an internet page using a computer and a server, which are essential elements of automation, so that it must be considered that such data are subject to automatic processing. \n23. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission submits that Directive 95/46 applies to all processing of personal data referred to in Article 3 thereof, regardless of the technical means used. Accordingly, making personal data available on the internet constitutes processing wholly or partly by automatic means, provided that there are no technical limitations which restrict the processing to a purely manual operation. Thus, by its very nature, an internet page falls within the scope of Directive 95/46. \nReply of the Court\n24. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The term \u0091personal data\u0092 used in Article 3(1) of Directive 95/46 covers, according to the definition in Article 2(a) thereof, \u0091any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u0092. The term undoubtedly covers the name of a person in conjunction with his telephone coordinates or information about his working conditions or hobbies. \n25. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the definition in Article 2(b) of Directive 95/46, the term \u0091processing\u0092 of such data used in Article 3(1) covers \u0091any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means\u0092. That provision gives several examples of such operations, including disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making data available. It follows that the operation of loading personal data on an internet page must be considered to be such processing. \n26. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It remains to be determined whether such processing is \u0091wholly or partly by automatic means\u0092. In that connection, placing information on an internet page entails, under current technical and computer procedures, the operation of loading that page onto a server and the operations necessary to make that page accessible to people who are connected to the internet. Such operations are performed, at least in part, automatically. \n27. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the first question must therefore be that the act of referring, on an internet page, to various persons and identifying them by name or by other means, for instance by giving their telephone number or information regarding their working conditions and hobbies, constitutes \u0091the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means\u0092 within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 95/46. \n The second question\n28. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the first question has been answered in the affirmative, there is no need to reply to the second question, which arises only in the event that the first question is answered in the negative. \n \n The third question\n29. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third question, the national court essentially seeks to know whether processing of personal data such as that described in the first question is covered by one of the exceptions in Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46. \nObservations submitted to the Court\n30. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs Lindqvist submits that private individuals who make use of their freedom of expression to create internet pages in the course of a non-profit-making or leisure activity are not carrying out an economic activity and are thus not subject to Community law. If the Court were to hold otherwise, the question of the validity of Directive 95/46 would arise, as, in adopting it, the Community legislature would have exceeded the powers conferred on it by Article 100a of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 95 EC). The approximation of laws, which concerns the establishment and functioning of the common market, cannot serve as a legal basis for Community measures regulating the right of private individuals to freedom of expression on the internet. \n31. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Swedish Government submits that, when Directive 95/46 was implemented in national law, the Swedish legislature took the view that processing of personal data by a natural person which consisted in publishing those data to an indeterminate number of people, for example through the internet, could not be described as \u0091a purely personal or household activity\u0092 within the meaning of the second indent of Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46. However, that Government does not rule out that the exception provided for in the first indent of that paragraph might cover cases in which a natural person publishes personal data on an internet page solely in the exercise of his freedom of expression and without any connection with a professional or commercial activity. \n32. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Netherlands Government, automatic processing of data such as that at issue in the main proceedings does not fall within any of the exceptions in Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46. As regards the exception in the second indent of that paragraph in particular, it observes that the creator of an internet page brings the data placed on it to the knowledge of a generally indeterminate group of people. \n33. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission submits that an internet page such as that at issue in the main proceedings cannot be considered to fall outside the scope of Directive 95/46 by virtue of Article 3(2) thereof, but constitutes, given the purpose of the internet page at issue in the main proceedings, an artistic and literary creation within the meaning of Article 9 of that Directive. \n 34. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It takes the view that the first indent of Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46 lends itself to two different interpretations. The first consists in limiting the scope of that provision to the areas cited as examples, in other words, to activities which essentially fall within what are generally called the second and third pillars. The other interpretation consists in excluding from the scope of Directive 95/46 the exercise of any activity which is not covered by Community law. \n35. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission argues that Community law is not limited to economic activities connected with the four fundamental freedoms. Referring to the legal basis of Directive 95/46, to its objective, to Article 6 EU, to the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union proclaimed in Nice on 18 December 2000 (OJ 2000 C 364, p. 1), and to the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data, it concludes that that directive is intended to regulate the free movement of personal data in the exercise not only of an economic activity, but also of social activity in the course of the integration and functioning of the common market. \n36. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It adds that to exclude generally from the scope of Directive 95/46 internet pages which contain no element of commerce or of provision of services might entail serious problems of demarcation. A large number of internet pages containing personal data intended to disparage certain persons with a particular end in view might then be excluded from the scope of that directive. \nReply of the Court\n37. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46 provides for two exceptions to its scope. \n38. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first exception concerns the processing of personal data in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union, and in any case processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the processing operation relates to State security matters) and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law. \n39. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the activities of Mrs Lindqvist which are at issue in the main proceedings are essentially not economic but charitable and religious, it is necessary to consider whether they constitute \u0091the processing of personal data in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law\u0092 within the meaning of the first indent of Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46. \n40. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has held, on the subject of Directive 95/46, which is based on Article 100a of the Treaty, that recourse to that legal basis does not presuppose the existence of an actual link with free movement between Member States in every situation referred to by the measure founded on that basis (see Joined Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n [2003] ECR I-4989, paragraph 41, and the case-law cited therein). \n \n41. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A contrary interpretation could make the limits of the field of application of the directive particularly unsure and uncertain, which would be contrary to its essential objective of approximating the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States in order to eliminate obstacles to the functioning of the internal market deriving precisely from disparities between national legislations (\n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, cited above, paragraph 42). \n42. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against that background, it would not be appropriate to interpret the expression \u0091activity which falls outside the scope of Community law\u0092 as having a scope which would require it to be determined in each individual case whether the specific activity at issue directly affected freedom of movement between Member States. \n43. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The activities mentioned by way of example in the first indent of Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46 (in other words, the activities provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union and processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security and activities in areas of criminal law) are, in any event, activities of the State or of State authorities and unrelated to the fields of activity of individuals. \n44. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must therefore be considered that the activities mentioned by way of example in the first indent of Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46 are intended to define the scope of the exception provided for there, with the result that that exception applies only to the activities which are expressly listed there or which can be classified in the same category (\nejusdem generis\n). \n45. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charitable or religious activities such as those carried out by Mrs Lindqvist cannot be considered equivalent to the activities listed in the first indent of Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46 and are thus not covered by that exception. \n46. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the exception provided for in the second indent of Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46, the 12th recital in the preamble to that directive, which concerns that exception, cites, as examples of the processing of data carried out by a natural person in the exercise of activities which are exclusively personal or domestic, correspondence and the holding of records of addresses. \n47. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That exception must therefore be interpreted as relating only to activities which are carried out in the course of private or family life of individuals, which is clearly not the case with the processing of personal data consisting in publication on the internet so that those data are made accessible to an indefinite number of people. \n48. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the third question must therefore be that processing of personal data such as that described in the reply to the first question is not covered by any of the exceptions in Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46. \n \n The fourth question\n49. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fourth question, the referring court seeks to know whether reference to the fact that an individual has injured her foot and is on half-time on medical grounds constitutes personal data concerning health within the meaning of Article 8(1) of Directive 95/46. \n50. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the purpose of the directive, the expression \u0091data concerning health\u0092 used in Article 8(1) thereof must be given a wide interpretation so as to include information concerning all aspects, both physical and mental, of the health of an individual. \n51. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the fourth question must therefore be that reference to the fact that an individual has injured her foot and is on half-time on medical grounds constitutes personal data concerning health within the meaning of Article 8(1) of Directive 95/46. \n The fifth question\n52. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its fifth question the referring court seeks essentially to know whether there is any \u0091transfer [of data] to a third country\u0092 within the meaning of Article 25 of Directive 95/46 where an individual in a Member State loads personal data onto an internet page which is stored on an internet site on which the page can be consulted and which is hosted by a natural or legal person (\u0091the hosting provider\u0092) who is established in that State or in another Member State, thereby making those data accessible to anyone who connects to the internet, including people in a third country. The referring court also asks whether the reply to that question would be the same if no one from the third country had in fact accessed the data or if the server where the page was stored was physically in a third country. \nObservations submitted to the Court\n53. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission and the Swedish Government consider that the loading, using a computer, of personal data onto an internet page, so that they become accessible to nationals of third countries, constitutes a transfer of data to third countries within the meaning of Directive 95/46. The answer would be the same if no one from the third country had in fact accessed the data or if the server where it was stored was physically in a third country. \n54. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Netherlands Government points out that the term \u0091transfer\u0092 is not defined by Directive 95/46. It takes the view, first, that that term must be understood to refer to the act of intentionally transferring personal data from the territory of a Member State to a third country and, second, that no distinction can be made between the different ways in which data are made accessible to third parties. It concludes that loading personal data onto an internet page using a computer cannot be considered to be a transfer of personal data to a third country within the meaning of Article 25 of Directive 95/46. \n55. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United Kingdom Government submits that Article 25 of Directive 95/46 concerns the transfer of data to third countries and not their accessibility from third countries. The term \u0091transfer\u0092 connotes the transmission of personal data from one place and person to another place and person. It is only in the event of such a transfer that Article 25 of Directive 95/46 requires Member States to ensure an adequate level of protection of personal data in a third country. \nReply of the Court\n56. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 95/46 does not define the expression \u0091transfer to a third country\u0092 in Article 25 or any other provision, including Article 2. \n57. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to determine whether loading personal data onto an internet page constitutes a \u0091transfer\u0092 of those data to a third country within the meaning of Article 25 of Directive 95/46 merely because it makes them accessible to people in a third country, it is necessary to take account both of the technical nature of the operations thus carried out and of the purpose and structure of Chapter IV of that directive where Article 25 appears. \n58. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Information on the internet can be consulted by an indefinite number of people living in many places at almost any time. The ubiquitous nature of that information is a result inter alia of the fact that the technical means used in connection with the internet are relatively simple and becoming less and less expensive. \n59. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the procedures for use of the internet available to individuals like Mrs Lindqvist during the 1990s, the author of a page intended for publication on the internet transmits the data making up that page to his hosting provider. That provider manages the computer infrastructure needed to store those data and connect the server hosting the site to the internet. That allows the subsequent transmission of those data to anyone who connects to the internet and seeks access to it. The computers which constitute that infrastructure may be located, and indeed often are located, in one or more countries other than that where the hosting provider is established, without its clients being aware or being in a position to be aware of it. \n60. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It appears from the court file that, in order to obtain the information appearing on the internet pages on which Mrs Lindqvist had included information about her colleagues, an internet user would not only have to connect to the internet but also personally carry out the necessary actions to consult those pages. In other words, Mrs Lindqvist's internet pages did not contain the technical means to send that information automatically to people who did not intentionally seek access to those pages. \n \n61. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in circumstances such as those in the case in the main proceedings, personal data which appear on the computer of a person in a third country, coming from a person who has loaded them onto an internet site, were not directly transferred between those two people but through the computer infrastructure of the hosting provider where the page is stored. \n62. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is in that light that it must be examined whether the Community legislature intended, for the purposes of the application of Chapter IV of Directive 95/46, to include within the expression \u0091transfer [of data] to a third country\u0092 within the meaning of Article 25 of that directive activities such as those carried out by Mrs Lindqvist. It must be stressed that the fifth question asked by the referring court concerns only those activities and not those carried out by the hosting providers. \n63. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter IV of Directive 95/46, in which Article 25 appears, sets up a special regime, with specific rules, intended to allow the Member States to monitor transfers of personal data to third countries. That Chapter sets up a complementary regime to the general regime set up by Chapter II of that directive concerning the lawfulness of processing of personal data. \n64. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The objective of Chapter IV is defined in the 56th to 60th recitals in the preamble to Directive 95/46, which state inter alia that, although the protection of individuals guaranteed in the Community by that Directive does not stand in the way of transfers of personal data to third countries which ensure an adequate level of protection, the adequacy of such protection must be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding the transfer operation or set of transfer operations. Where a third country does not ensure an adequate level of protection the transfer of personal data to that country must be prohibited. \n65. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For its part, Article 25 of Directive 95/46 imposes a series of obligations on Member States and on the Commission for the purposes of monitoring transfers of personal data to third countries in the light of the level of protection afforded to such data in each of those countries. \n66. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, Article 25(4) of Directive 95/46 provides that, where the Commission finds that a third country does not ensure an adequate level of protection, Member States are to take the measures necessary to prevent any transfer of personal data to the third country in question. \n67. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter IV of Directive 95/46 contains no provision concerning use of the internet. In particular, it does not lay down criteria for deciding whether operations carried out by hosting providers should be deemed to occur in the place of establishment of the service or at its business address or in the place where the computer or computers constituting the service's infrastructure are located. \n68. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given, first, the state of development of the internet at the time Directive 95/46 was drawn up and, second, the absence, in Chapter IV, of criteria applicable to use of the internet, one cannot presume that the Community legislature intended the expression \u0091transfer [of data] to a third country\u0092 to cover the loading, by an individual in Mrs Lindqvist's position, of data onto an internet page, even if those data are thereby made accessible to persons in third countries with the technical means to access them. \n69. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Article 25 of Directive 95/46 were interpreted to mean that there is \u0091transfer [of data] to a third country\u0092 every time that personal data are loaded onto an internet page, that transfer would necessarily be a transfer to all the third countries where there are the technical means needed to access the internet. The special regime provided for by Chapter IV of the directive would thus necessarily become a regime of general application, as regards operations on the internet. Thus, if the Commission found, pursuant to Article 25(4) of Directive 95/46, that even one third country did not ensure adequate protection, the Member States would be obliged to prevent any personal data being placed on the internet. \n70. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it must be concluded that Article 25 of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that operations such as those carried out by Mrs Lindqvist do not as such constitute a \u0091transfer [of data] to a third country\u0092. It is thus unnecessary to investigate whether an individual from a third country has accessed the internet page concerned or whether the server of that hosting service is physically in a third country. \n71. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reply to the fifth question must therefore be that there is no \u0091transfer [of data] to a third country\u0092 within the meaning of Article 25 of Directive 95/46 where an individual in a Member State loads personal data onto an internet page which is stored with his hosting provider which is established in that State or in another Member State, thereby making those data accessible to anyone who connects to the internet, including people in a third country. \n The sixth question\n72. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its sixth question the referring court seeks to know whether the provisions of Directive 95/46, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, bring about a restriction which conflicts with the general principles of freedom of expression or other freedoms and rights, which are applicable within the European Union and are enshrined in inter alia Article 10 of the ECHR. \nObservations submitted to the Court\n73. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citing inter alia Case C-274/99 P \nConnolly\n v \nCommission\n [2001] ECR I-1611, Mrs Lindqvist submits that Directive 95/46 and the PUL, in so far as they lay down requirements of prior consent and prior notification of a supervisory authority and a principle of prohibiting processing of personal data of a sensitive nature, are contrary to the general principle of freedom of expression enshrined in Community law. More particularly, she argues that the definition of \u0091processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means\u0092 does not fulfil the criteria of predictability and accuracy. \n74. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She argues further that merely mentioning a natural person by name, revealing their telephone details and working conditions and giving information about their state of health and hobbies, information which is in the public domain, well-known or trivial, does not constitute a significant breach of the right to respect for private life. Mrs Lindqvist considers that, in any event, the constraints imposed by Directive 95/46 are disproportionate to the objective of protecting the reputation and private life of others. \n75. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Swedish Government considers that Directive 95/46 allows the interests at stake to be weighed against each other and freedom of expression and protection of private life to be thereby safeguarded. It adds that only the national court can assess, in the light of the facts of each individual case, whether the restriction on the exercise of the right to freedom of expression entailed by the application of the rules on the protection of the rights of others is proportionate. \n76. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Netherlands Government points out that both freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life are among the general principles of law for which the Court ensures respect and that the ECHR does not establish any hierarchy between the various fundamental rights. It therefore considers that the national court must endeavour to balance the various fundamental rights at issue by taking account of the circumstances of the individual case. \n77. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United Kingdom Government points out that its proposed reply to the fifth question, set out in paragraph 55 of this judgment, is wholly in accordance with fundamental rights and avoids any disproportionate restriction on freedom of expression. It adds that it is difficult to justify an interpretation which would mean that the publication of personal data in a particular form, that is to say, on an internet page, is subject to far greater restrictions than those applicable to publication in other forms, such as on paper. \n78. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission also submits that Directive 95/46 does not entail any restriction contrary to the general principle of freedom of expression or other rights and freedoms applicable in the European Union corresponding inter alia to the right provided for in Article 10 of the ECHR. \nReply of the Court\n79. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the seventh recital in the preamble to Directive 95/46, the establishment and functioning of the common market are liable to be seriously affected by differences in national rules applicable to the processing of personal data. According to the third recital of that directive the harmonisation of those national rules must seek to ensure not only the free flow of such data between Member States but also the safeguarding of the fundamental rights of individuals. Those objectives may of course be inconsistent with one another. \n80. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the one hand, the economic and social integration resulting from the establishment and functioning of the internal market will necessarily lead to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data between all those involved in a private or public capacity in economic and social activity in the Member States, whether businesses or public authorities of the Member States. Those so involved will, to a certain extent, need to have access to personal data to perform their transactions or carry out their tasks within the area without internal frontiers which the internal market constitutes. \n81. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, those affected by the processing of personal data understandably require those data to be effectively protected. \n82. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mechanisms allowing those different rights and interests to be balanced are contained, first, in Directive 95/46 itself, in that it provides for rules which determine in what circumstances and to what extent the processing of personal data is lawful and what safeguards must be provided for. Second, they result from the adoption, by the Member States, of national provisions implementing that directive and their application by the national authorities. \n83. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards Directive 95/46 itself, its provisions are necessarily relatively general since it has to be applied to a large number of very different situations. Contrary to Mrs Lindqvist's contentions, the directive quite properly includes rules with a degree of flexibility and, in many instances, leaves to the Member States the task of deciding the details or choosing between options. \n84. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, in many respects, the Member States have a margin for manoeuvre in implementing Directive 95/46. However, there is nothing to suggest that the regime it provides for lacks predictability or that its provisions are, as such, contrary to the general principles of Community law and, in particular, to the fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order. \n85. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it is, rather, at the stage of the application at national level of the legislation implementing Directive 95/46 in individual cases that a balance must be found between the rights and interests involved. \n86. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, fundamental rights have a particular importance, as demonstrated by the case in the main proceedings, in which, in essence, Mrs Lindqvist's freedom of expression in her work preparing people for Communion and her freedom to carry out activities contributing to religious life have to be weighed against the protection of the private life of the individuals about whom Mrs Lindqvist has placed data on her internet site. \n \n87. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, it is for the authorities and courts of the Member States not only to interpret their national law in a manner consistent with Directive 95/46 but also to make sure they do not rely on an interpretation of it which would be in conflict with the fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order or with the other general principles of Community law, such as inter alia the principle of proportionality. \n88. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whilst it is true that the protection of private life requires the application of effective sanctions against people processing personal data in ways inconsistent with Directive 95/46, such sanctions must always respect the principle of proportionality. That is so \na fortiori\n since the scope of Directive 95/46 is very wide and the obligations of those who process personal data are many and significant. \n89. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for the referring court to take account, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, of all the circumstances of the case before it, in particular the duration of the breach of the rules implementing Directive 95/46 and the importance, for the persons concerned, of the protection of the data disclosed. \n90. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to the sixth question must therefore be that the provisions of Directive 95/46 do not, in themselves, bring about a restriction which conflicts with the general principles of freedom of expression or other freedoms and rights, which are applicable within the European Union and are enshrined inter alia in Article 10 of the ECHR. It is for the national authorities and courts responsible for applying the national legislation implementing Directive 95/46 to ensure a fair balance between the rights and interests in question, including the fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order. \n The seventh question\n91. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its seventh question, the referring court essentially seeks to know whether it is permissible for the Member States to provide for greater protection for personal data or a wider scope than are required under Directive 95/46. \nObservations submitted to the Court\n92. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Swedish Government states that Directive 95/46 is not confined to fixing minimum conditions for the protection of personal data. Member States are obliged, in the course of implementing that directive, to attain the level of protection dictated by it and are not empowered to provide for greater or less protection. However, account must be taken of the discretion which the Member States have in implementing the directive to lay down in their domestic law the general conditions for the lawfulness of the processing of personal data. \n93. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Netherlands Government submits that Directive 95/46 does not preclude Member States from providing for greater protection in certain areas. It is clear, for example, from Article 10, Article 11(1), subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 14, Article 17(3), Article 18(5) and Article 19(1) of that directive that the Member States may make provision for wider protection. Moreover, the Member States are free to apply the principles of Directive 95/46 also to activities which do not fall within its scope. \n94. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission submits that Directive 95/46 is based on Article 100a of the Treaty and that, if a Member State wishes to maintain or introduce legislation which derogates from such a harmonising directive, it is obliged to notify the Commission pursuant to Article 95(4) or 95(5) EC. The Commission therefore submits that a Member State cannot make provision for more extensive protection for personal data or a wider scope than are required under the directive. \nReply of the Court\n95. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 95/46 is intended, as appears from the eighth recital in the preamble thereto, to ensure that the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data is equivalent in all Member States. The tenth recital adds that the approximation of the national laws applicable in this area must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community. \n96. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The harmonisation of those national laws is therefore not limited to minimal harmonisation but amounts to harmonisation which is generally complete. It is upon that view that Directive 95/46 is intended to ensure free movement of personal data while guaranteeing a high level of protection for the rights and interests of the individuals to whom such data relate. \n97. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that Directive 95/46 allows the Member States a margin for manoeuvre in certain areas and authorises them to maintain or introduce particular rules for specific situations as a large number of its provisions demonstrate. However, such possibilities must be made use of in the manner provided for by Directive 95/46 and in accordance with its objective of maintaining a balance between the free movement of personal data and the protection of private life. \n98. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, nothing prevents a Member State from extending the scope of the national legislation implementing the provisions of Directive 95/46 to areas not included within the scope thereof, provided that no other provision of Community law precludes it. \n99. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of those considerations, the answer to the seventh question must be that measures taken by the Member States to ensure the protection of personal data must be consistent both with the provisions of Directive 95/46 and with its objective of maintaining a balance between freedom of movement of personal data and the protection of private life. However, nothing prevents a Member State from extending the scope of the national legislation implementing the provisions of Directive 95/46 to areas not included in the scope thereof provided that no other provision of Community law precludes it. \n Costs\n100. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The costs incurred by the Swedish, Netherlands and United Kingdom Governments and by the Commission and the EFTA Surveillance Authority, which have submitted observations to the Court, are not recoverable. Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. \nOn those grounds,\nTHE COURT,\nin answer to the questions referred to it by the G\u00f6ta hovr\u00e4tt by order of 23 February 2001, hereby rules:\n 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The act of referring, on an internet page, to various persons and identifying them by name or by other means, for instance by giving their telephone number or information regarding their working conditions and hobbies, constitutes \u0091the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means\u0092 within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such processing of personal data is not covered by any of the exceptions in Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46. \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reference to the fact that an individual has injured her foot and is on half-time on medical grounds constitutes personal data concerning health within the meaning of Article 8(1) of Directive 95/46. \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no \u0091transfer [of data] to a third country\u0092 within the meaning of Article 25 of Directive 95/46 where an individual in a Member State loads personal data onto an internet page which is stored on an internet site on which the page can be consulted and which is hosted by a natural or legal person who is established in that State or in another Member State, thereby making those data accessible to anyone who connects to the internet, including people in a third country. \n 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provisions of Directive 95/46 do not, in themselves, bring about a restriction which conflicts with the general principles of freedom of expression or other freedoms and rights, which are applicable within the European Union and are enshrined inter alia in Article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed at Rome on 4 November 1950. It is for the national authorities and courts responsible for applying the national legislation implementing Directive 95/46 to ensure a fair balance between the rights and interests in question, including the fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order. \n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Measures taken by the Member States to ensure the protection of personal data must be consistent both with the provisions of Directive 95/46 and with its objective of maintaining a balance between freedom of movement of personal data and the protection of private life. However, nothing prevents a Member State from extending the scope of the national legislation implementing the provisions of Directive 95/46 to areas not included in the scope thereof provided that no other provision of Community law precludes it. \nJannTimmermans Gulmann \nCunha RodriguesRosas Edward \nPuissochet Macken von Bahr \nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 6 November 2003.\nR.

entitled \u2018Penalties\u2019, provides, in paragraph\u00a01 thereof:\n\u2018Member States shall lay down the rules on other penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation in particular for infringements which are not subject to administrative fines pursuant to Article\u00a083, and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. Such penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicant in the main proceedings, a natural person practising as a self-employed lawyer, was a client of juris, a company operating a legal database.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 6\u00a0November 2018, after learning that his personal data were also being used by juris for the purposes of direct marketing, the applicant in the main proceedings revoked, in writing, all his consents to receive information from that company by email or by telephone, and he objected to any processing of those data, except for the purposes of sending newsletters which he wished to continue to receive.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite that step, the applicant in the main proceedings received, in January 2019, two advertising leaflets sent by name to his business address. By email sent to juris on 18\u00a0April 2019, he reminded juris of his prior objection to any marketing, he informed juris that the creation of those prospectuses had given rise to unlawful processing of his data and requested compensation for the damage suffered by him under Article\u00a082 of the GDPR. Upon receiving a new advertising leaflet on 3\u00a0May 2019, he reiterated his objection, which was this time served on juris by bailiff.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each of those leaflets contained a \u2018trial personal code\u2019 giving access, on the juris website, to an order form for that company\u2019s products which included information relating to the applicant in the main proceedings, as was established, at the latter\u2019s request, by a notary on 7\u00a0June 2019.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The applicant in the main proceedings brought an action before the Landgericht Saarbr\u00fccken (Regional Court, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany), which is the referring court in the present case, seeking, on the basis of Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR, compensation for his material damage, relating to the costs of the bailiff and notary incurred by him, and for his non-material damage. He submits, inter alia, that he has suffered a loss of control over his personal data as a result of the processing of those data by juris despite his objections, and that he is entitled to obtain compensation on that basis, without having to show the effects or gravity of the infringement of his rights, guaranteed by Article\u00a08 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and specified in that regulation.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its defence, juris dismisses any liability, arguing that it had indeed established a system for managing objections to marketing and that the late taking into account of those of the applicant in the main proceedings was due either to the fact that one of its employees had not complied with the instructions given or to the fact that it would have been excessively onerous to take those objections into account. It claims that the mere breach of an obligation under the GDPR, such as that under Article\u00a021(3) thereof, cannot, in itself, constitute \u2018damage\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a082(1) of that regulation.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, the referring court starts from the premiss that the right to compensation under Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR is subject to the fulfilment of three conditions, namely an infringement of that regulation, material or non-material damage, and a causal link between that infringement and that damage. Next, in view of the claims of the applicant in the main proceedings, the referring court asks whether it should nevertheless be held that an infringement of the GDPR constitutes, in itself, non-material damage giving rise to a right to compensation, in particular where the infringed provision of that regulation confers a subjective right on the data subject. Lastly, given that German law makes monetary compensation for non-material damage subject to the requirement of serious harm to the protected rights, that court asks whether a similar restriction must apply to claims for compensation under the GDPR, in the light of the guidance relating to the concept of \u2018damage\u2019 in recitals\u00a085 and 146 of that regulation.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, that court considers it possible that it follows from Article\u00a082 of the GDPR that, where an infringement of that regulation has been established, that infringement is deemed to be attributable to the controller, with the result that there is liability for presumed fault, or even no fault, on the part of the controller. Furthermore, after pointing out that paragraph\u00a03 of that article does not specify the evidential requirements specifically linked to the exemption provided for in that paragraph, the referring court observes that, if the controller were allowed to avoid liability by merely relying, in general terms, on wrongful conduct on the part of one of its employees, that would significantly limit the effectiveness of the right to compensation provided for in paragraph\u00a01 of that article.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, the referring court wishes to know, inter alia, whether, in order to assess the amount of monetary compensation for damage, in particular non-material damage, which would be due under Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, the criteria laid down in Article\u00a083(2) and (5) of that regulation for deciding the amount of administrative fines may, or indeed must, also be taken into account in the context of Article\u00a082.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fourth and final place, that court notes that, in the dispute before it, the personal data of the applicant in the main proceedings have been processed on several occasions for the purposes of marketing, despite the repeated objections of the data subject. It therefore seeks to determine whether, where there are such multiple infringements of the GDPR, those infringements must be taken into account individually or globally, with a view to setting the amount of compensation that may be due under Article\u00a082 of that regulation.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Landgericht Saarbr\u00fccken (Regional Court, Saarbr\u00fccken) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of recital\u00a085 and the third sentence of recital\u00a0146 of the GDPR, is the concept of \u2018non-material damage\u2019 in Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR to be understood as covering any impairment of the protected legal position, irrespective of the other effects and materiality of that impairment?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is liability for compensation under Article\u00a082(3) of the GDPR excluded by the fact that the infringement is attributed to human error in the individual case on the part of a person acting under the authority of the processor or controller within the meaning of Article\u00a029 of the GDPR?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it permissible or necessary [to base] the assessment of compensation for non-material damage [on the] criteria for determining fines set out in Article\u00a083 of the GDPR, in particular in Article\u00a083(2) and 83(5) of the GDPR?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the compensation be determined for each individual infringement, or are several infringements\u00a0\u2013 or at least several infringements of the same nature\u00a0\u2013 penalised by means of an overall amount of compensation, which is not determined by adding up individual amounts but is based on an evaluative overall assessment?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n\u00a0\nAdmissibility\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, juris submits, in essence, that the first question is inadmissible in so far as it seeks to establish whether entitlement to compensation under Article\u00a082 of the GDPR is subject to the requirement that the damage alleged by the data subject, as defined in Article\u00a04(1) of that regulation, has reached a certain degree of seriousness. That question is, it contends, irrelevant to the resolution of the dispute in the main proceedings, on the ground that the damage alleged by the applicant in the main proceedings, namely a loss of control over his personal data, did not occur, since those data were lawfully processed, as part of the contractual relationship between the parties to that dispute.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it must be borne in mind that it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court, which enjoy a presumption of relevance. Therefore, since the question referred concerns the interpretation or validity of a rule of EU law, the Court is, in principle, required to give a ruling, unless it is quite obvious that the interpretation sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or to its purposes or where the problem is hypothetical or the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the question submitted to it (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2023, \n\u00d6sterreichische Post (Non-material damage in connection with the processing of personal data)\n, C-300/21, EU:C:2023:370, paragraph\u00a023 and the case-law cited).\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the first question concerns the conditions required for the exercise of the right to compensation provided for in Article\u00a082 of the GDPR. Furthermore, it is not obvious that the interpretation sought bears no relation to the dispute in the main proceedings or that the problem raised is hypothetical. This dispute concerns a claim for compensation falling within the rules established by the GDPR for the protection of personal data. Second, that question seeks, in essence, to determine whether, for the purposes of the application of the rules on liability laid down by that regulation, it is necessary not only that there be non-material damage that is distinct from the infringement of that regulation, but also that that damage exceeds a certain threshold of seriousness.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first question is therefore admissible.\n\u00a0\nSubstance\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that an infringement of provisions of that regulation which confer rights on the data subject is sufficient, in itself, to constitute \u2018non-material damage\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, irrespective of the degree of seriousness of the harm suffered by that person.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be recalled that Article\u00a082(1) GDPR provides that any person \u2018who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered\u2019.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already interpreted Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR as meaning that the mere infringement of that regulation is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation, since the existence of \u2018damage\u2019, material or non-material, or of \u2018damage\u2019 which has been \u2018suffered\u2019 constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation laid down in Article\u00a082(1), as does the existence of an infringement of that regulation and of a causal link between that damage and that infringement, those three conditions being cumulative (see, to that effect, judgment of 25\u00a0January 2024, \nMediaMarktSaturn\n, C-687/21, EU:C:2024:72, paragraph\u00a058 and the case-law cited).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the person seeking compensation for non-material damage on the basis of that provision is required to establish not only the infringement of provisions of that regulation, but also that that infringement caused him or her such damage (see, to that effect, judgment of 25\u00a0January 2024, \nMediaMarktSaturn\n (C-687/21, EU:C:2024:72, paragraphs\u00a060 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On that point, it should be noted that the Court has interpreted Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR as precluding a national rule or practice which makes compensation for non-material damage, within the meaning of that provision, subject to the condition that the damage suffered by the data subject has reached a certain degree of seriousness, while emphasising that that person is nevertheless required to demonstrate that the infringement of that regulation caused him or her such non-material damage (see, to that effect, judgment of 25\u00a0January 2024, \nMediaMarktSaturn,\n C-687/21, EU:C:2024:72, paragraphs\u00a059 and 60 and the case-law cited).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if the provision of the GDPR which has been infringed grants rights to natural persons, such an infringement cannot, in itself, constitute \u2018non-material damage\u2019 within the meaning of that regulation.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Admittedly, it is apparent from Article\u00a079(1) of the GDPR that every data subject has the right to an effective judicial remedy against the controller or any processor if he or she considers that \u2018his or her rights under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of his or her personal data in non-compliance with this Regulation\u2019.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, that provision merely confers a right to bring an action on a person who considers himself or herself to be a victim of a breach of the rights conferred on him or her by the GDPR, without exempting that person from his or her obligation under Article\u00a082(1) of that regulation to prove that he or she has actually suffered material or non-material damage.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the infringement of provisions of the GDPR granting rights to the data subject is not in itself sufficient to found a substantive right to obtain compensation under that regulation, which requires that the other two conditions of that right referred to in paragraph\u00a034 of the present judgment also be satisfied.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the applicant in the main proceedings claims, on the basis of the GDPR, compensation for non-material damage, namely a loss of control over his personal data that have been processed despite his objection, without being required to prove that that damage exceeded a certain threshold of seriousness.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that recital\u00a085 of the GDPR expressly mentions \u2018loss of control\u2019 among the damage that may be caused by a personal data breach. In addition, the Court has held that the loss of control over such data, even for a short period of time, may constitute \u2018non-material damage\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a082(1) of that regulation, giving rise to a right to compensation, provided that the data subject can show that he or she has actually suffered such damage, however slight (see, to that effect, judgment of 25\u00a0January 2024 in \nMediaMarktSaturn\n, C-687/21, EU:C:2024:72, paragraph\u00a066 and the case-law cited).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing reasons, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that an infringement of provisions of that regulation which confer rights on the data subject is not sufficient, in itself, to constitute \u2018non-material damage\u2019 within the meaning of that provision, irrespective of the degree of seriousness of the damage suffered by that person.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a082 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that it is sufficient for the controller, in order to be exempted from liability under paragraph\u00a03 of that article, to claim that the damage in question was caused by the failure of a person acting under his authority, within the meaning of Article\u00a029 of that regulation.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that Article\u00a082 of the GDPR states, in paragraph\u00a02 thereof, that any controller involved in the processing is to be liable for the damage caused by processing which infringes that regulation and, in paragraph\u00a03 thereof, that a controller is exempt from liability under paragraph\u00a02 if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already held that it is apparent from a combined analysis of Article\u00a082(2) and (3) that that article provides for a fault-based regime, in which the controller is presumed to have participated in the processing constituting the breach of the GDPR in question, so that the burden of proof lies not with the person who has suffered damage but with the controller (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2023, \nKrankenversicherung Nordrhein\n, C-667/21, EU:C:2023:1022, paragraphs\u00a092 to 94).\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards whether the controller may be exempted from liability under Article\u00a082(3) of the GDPR on the sole ground that that damage was caused by the wrongful conduct of a person acting under his authority, within the meaning of Article\u00a029 of that regulation, first, it is apparent from Article\u00a029 that persons acting under the authority of the controller, such as its employees, who have access to personal data, may, in principle, process those data only on instructions from that controller and in accordance with those instructions (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2023, \nPankki S\n, C-579/21, EU:C:2023:501, paragraphs\u00a073 and 74).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Article\u00a032(4) of the GDPR, relating to the security of processing of personal data, provides that the controller is to take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller, who has access to such data, does not process them, except on instructions from the controller, unless he or she is required to do so by EU or Member State law.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An employee of the controller is indeed a natural person acting under the authority of that controller. Thus, it is for that controller to ensure that his or her instructions are correctly applied by his or her employees. Accordingly, the controller cannot avoid liability under Article\u00a082(3) of the GDPR simply by relying on negligence or failure on the part of a person acting under his or her authority.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, in its written observations before the Court, juris submits, in essence, that the controller should be exempt from liability under Article\u00a082(3) of the GDPR where the breach which caused the damage in question is attributable to the conduct of one of its employees who has failed to comply with the instructions of that controller and provided that that breach is not due to a failure to comply with the obligations of the controller set out, in particular, in Articles\u00a024, 25 and 32 of that regulation.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be pointed out that the circumstances of the exemption provided for in Article\u00a082(3) of the GDPR must be strictly limited to those in which the controller is able to demonstrate that the damage is not attributable to him or her (see, to that effect, judgment of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraph\u00a070). Therefore, in the event of a personal data breach committed by a person acting under his or her authority, that controller may benefit from that exemption only if he or she proves that there is no causal link between any breach of the data protection obligation incumbent on him or her under Articles\u00a05, 24 and 32 of that regulation and the damage suffered by the data subject (see, by analogy, judgment of 14\u00a0December 2023, \nNatsionalna agentsia za prihodite\n, C-340/21, EU:C:2023:986, paragraph\u00a072).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in order for the controller to be exempted from liability under Article\u00a082(3) of the GDPR, it cannot be sufficient for him or her to demonstrate that he or she had given instructions to persons acting under its authority, within the meaning of Article\u00a029 of that regulation, and that one of those persons failed in his or her obligation to follow those instructions, with the result that that person contributed to the occurrence of the damage in question.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If it were accepted that the controller may be exempted from liability merely by relying on the failure of a person acting under his or her authority, that would undermine the effectiveness of the right to compensation enshrined in Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR, as the referring court noted, in essence, and would not be consistent with the objective of that regulation, which is to ensure a high level of protection for individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a082 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that it is not sufficient for the controller, in order to be exempted from liability under paragraph\u00a03 of that article, to claim that the damage in question was caused by the failure of a person acting under his or her authority, within the meaning of Article\u00a029 of that regulation.\n\u00a0\nThe third and fourth questions\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its third and fourth questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, in order to determine the amount of damages due as compensation for damage based on that provision, it is necessary, first, to apply \nmutatis mutandis\n the criteria for setting the amount of administrative fines laid down in Article\u00a083 of that regulation and, second, to take account of the fact that several infringements of that regulation concerning the same processing operation affect the person seeking compensation.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, as regards the possible taking into account of the criteria set out in Article\u00a083 of the GDPR for the purpose of assessing the amount of compensation due under Article\u00a082 thereof, it is common ground that those two provisions pursue different objectives. While Article\u00a083 of that regulation determines the \u2018general conditions for imposing administrative fines\u2019, Article\u00a082 of that regulation governs the \u2018right to compensation and liability\u2019.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the criteria set out in Article\u00a083 of the GDPR for the purposes of determining the amount of administrative fines, which are also mentioned in recital\u00a0148 of that regulation, cannot be used to assess the amount of damages under Article\u00a082 thereof.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has already pointed out, the GDPR does not contain any provision relating to the assessment of the damages due under the right to compensation enshrined in Article\u00a082 of that regulation. Therefore, for the purposes of that assessment, the national courts must, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy, apply the domestic rules of each Member State relating to the extent of monetary compensation, provided that the principles of equivalence and effectiveness of EU law, as defined by the settled case-law of the Court, are complied with (see, to that effect, judgments of 21\u00a0December 2023, \nKrankenversicherung Nordrhein\n, C-667/21, EU:C:2023:1022, paragraphs\u00a083 and 101 and the case-law cited, and of 25\u00a0January 2024, \nMediaMarktSaturn\n, C-687/21, EU:C:2024:72, paragraph\u00a053).\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the Court emphasised that Article\u00a082 of the GDPR has a function that is compensatory and not punitive, contrary to other provisions of that regulation also contained in Chapter VIII thereof, namely Articles\u00a083 and 84, which have, for their part, essentially a punitive purpose, since they permit the imposition of administrative fines and other penalties, respectively. The relationship between the rules set out in Article\u00a082 and those set out in Articles\u00a083 and 84 shows that there is a difference between those two categories of provisions, but also complementarity, in terms of encouraging compliance with the GDPR, it being observed that the right of any person to seek compensation for damage reinforces the operational nature of the protection rules laid down by that regulation and is likely to discourage the reoccurrence of unlawful conduct (judgment of 25\u00a0January 2024, \nMediaMarktSaturn\n, C-687/21, EU:C:2024:72, paragraph\u00a047 and the case-law cited).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the Court inferred from the fact that the right to compensation provided for in Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR does not fulfil a deterrent, or even punitive, function that the gravity of the infringement of that regulation that caused the alleged material or non-material damage cannot influence the amount of the compensation granted under that provision. It follows that that amount cannot exceed the full compensation for that damage (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2023, \nKrankenversicherung Nordrhein\n, C-667/21, EU:C:2023:1022, paragraph\u00a086).\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Referring to the sixth sentence of recital\u00a0146 of the GDPR, according to which that instrument is intended to ensure \u2018full and effective compensation for the damage\u00a0\u2026 suffered\u2019, the Court noted that, in view of the compensatory function of the right to compensation provided for in Article\u00a082 of that regulation, monetary compensation based on that article must be regarded as \u2018full and effective\u2019 if it allows the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation to be compensated in its entirety, without there being any need, for the purposes of such compensation for the damage in its entirety, to require the payment of punitive damages (judgment of 21\u00a0December 2023, \nKrankenversicherung Nordrhein\n, C-667/21, EU:C:2023:1022, paragraph\u00a084 and the case-law cited).\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in the light of the differences in wording and purposes existing between Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, read in the light of recital\u00a0146 thereof, and Article\u00a083 of that regulation, read in the light of recital\u00a0148 thereof, it cannot be considered that the assessment criteria set out specifically in Article\u00a083 are applicable \nmutatis mutandis\n in the context of Article\u00a082, notwithstanding the fact that the legal remedies provided for in those two provisions are indeed complementary to ensure compliance with that regulation.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards the way in which national courts must assess the amount of monetary compensation under Article\u00a082 of the GDPR in the case of multiple infringements of that regulation affecting the same data subject, it should, first of all, be pointed out that, as mentioned in paragraph\u00a058 of the present judgment, it is for each Member State to establish the criteria for determining the amount of that compensation, subject to compliance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence of EU law.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, in view of the compensatory rather than punitive function of Article\u00a082 of the GDPR, which is recalled in paragraphs\u00a060 and 61 of this judgment, the fact that several infringements have been committed by the controller in relation to the same data subject cannot constitute a relevant criterion for the purposes of assessing the compensation to be awarded to that data subject under Article\u00a082. Only the damage actually suffered by that person must be taken into consideration in order to determine the amount of the monetary compensation due by way of compensation.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the answer to the third and fourth questions is that Article\u00a082(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, in order to determine the amount of damages due as compensation for damage based on that provision, it is not necessary, first, to apply \nmutatis mutandis\n the criteria for setting the amount of administrative fines laid down in Article\u00a083 of that regulation and, second, to take account of the fact that several infringements of that regulation concerning the same processing operation affect the person seeking compensation.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a082(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\nmust be interpreted as meaning that an infringement of provisions of that regulation which confer rights on the data subject is not sufficient, in itself, to constitute \u2018non-material damage\u2019 within the meaning of that provision, irrespective of the degree of seriousness of the damage suffered by that person.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a082 of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that it is not sufficient for the controller, in order to be exempted from liability under paragraph\u00a03 of that article, to claim that the damage in question was caused by the failure of a person acting under his or her authority, within the meaning of Article\u00a029 of that regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a082(1) of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that in order to determine the amount of damages due as compensation for damage based on that provision, it is not necessary, first, to apply \nmutatis mutandis\n the criteria for setting the amount of administrative fines laid down in Article\u00a083 of that regulation and, second, to take account of the fact that several infringements of that regulation concerning the same processing operation affect the person seeking compensation."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 22 Nov 2012, C-119/12 (\nProbst\n)\nE-privacy Directive \n >

At first, the charges claimed for were billed to Mr Probst by Deutsche Telekom AG as \u2018amounts due to other providers\u2019. When Mr Probst failed to make payment, nexnet, as assignee of that debt pursuant to a factoring contract concluded between the legal predecessors to Verizon and to nexnet, claimed payment of the amounts billed together with various charges. Under the factoring contract nexnet bears the risk of debtor default.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The legal predecessors of nexnet and Verizon also concluded a \u2018data protection and confidentiality agreement\u2019 which provides:\n\u2018I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Data protection\n\u2026\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The contracting parties undertake to process and use the protected data only within the framework of the abovementioned cooperation and exclusively for the purpose of the present contract and in the manner prescribed.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as the information included as protected data is no longer required for such purpose, all protected data held in that connection shall forthwith be erased irretrievably or returned. \u2026\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each contracting party shall be entitled to check that the other party has ensured data protection and data security in accordance with the present agreement. \u2026\nII. Confidentiality\n\u2026\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The contracting parties shall process and use the confidential documents and information provided exclusively for the performance of the contract concluded between them. They shall make these accessible only to those employees who require such for the performance of the contract. The parties shall require those employees to maintain confidentiality in accordance with this agreement.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On request by a contracting party, or at the latest on termination of the cooperation between the contracting parties, all confidential data held in that connection shall be erased irretrievably or returned to the other party. \u2026\n\u2026\u2019\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Mr Probst, the factoring contract is void in so far as it breaches, inter alia, Paragraph\u00a097(1) of the TKG. The Amtsgericht (local court) rejected nexnet\u2019s claim for payment, while the appellate court upheld it in substance. An appeal on a point of law (\u2018Revision\u2019) has been brought before the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice).\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bundesgerichtshof takes the view that Article\u00a06(2) and (5) of Directive\u00a02002/58 is relevant for the interpretation of Paragraph\u00a097(1) of the TKG. It states, first, that \u2018billing\u2019, which is one of the objectives in respect of which Article\u00a06(2) and (5) of that directive authorises the processing of traffic data, does not necessarily include the collection of the amount invoiced. However, it takes the view there is no objective reason for treating billing and debt collection differently with respect to data protection. Second, Article\u00a06(5) of that directive restricts the processing of traffic data to persons acting under the authority of providers of the public communications networks and publicly available electronic communications services (\u2018service provider\u2019). According to the referring court, it is unclear from that definition whether the service provider must actually be able to determine the use of the data, including on a case-by-case basis, throughout the duration of the data processing or whether it is sufficient that general rules relating to respect for the privacy of telecommunications and data protection are laid down, such as those agreed in the present case in the contractual provisions, and that it is possible for the data to be erased or returned on request.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Bundesgerichtshof decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018Does Article\u00a06(2) and (5) of Directive 2002/58 permit the passing of traffic data from the service provider to the assignee of a claim for payment in respect of telecommunications services in the case where the assignment effected with a view to the collection of transferred debts includes, in addition to the general obligation to respect the privacy of telecommunications and to ensure data protection as provided for under the applicable legislation, the following contractual stipulations: \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the service provider and the assignee undertake to process and use the protected data only within the framework of their cooperation and exclusively for the purpose of the contract and in the manner prescribed therein; \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as soon as the information in the protected data is no longer required for such purpose, all protected data held in that connection are to be irreversibly erased or returned; \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0each contracting party is entitled to check that the other party has ensured data protection and data security in accordance with this agreement;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0confidential documents and information transferred may be made accessible only to such employees as require these for the purposes of performing the contract;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the contracting parties are to require those employees to maintain confidentiality in accordance with this agreement;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on request, or at the latest on termination of the cooperation between the contracting parties, all confidential data held in that connection are to be irreversibly erased or returned to the other party?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the question referred for a preliminary ruling\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its question, the referring court asks essentially whether, and in what circumstances, Article\u00a06(2) and (5) of Directive 2002/58 allows a service provider to pass traffic data to the assignee of its claims for payment and allows the latter to process those data.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, in accordance with Article\u00a06(2) of Directive 2002/58, traffic data necessary for the purposes of subscriber billing and interconnection payments may be processed. As nexnet and the European Commission submit, that provision of that directive authorises processing of traffic data not only for the purpose of billing but also for that of debt collection. By authorising traffic data processing \u2018up to the end of the period during which the bill may lawfully be challenged or payment pursued\u2019, that provision relates not only to data processing at the time of billing but also to the processing necessary for securing payment thereof.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, pursuant to Article\u00a06(5) of Directive 2002/58, traffic data processing authorised by Article\u00a06(2) thereof \u2018must be restricted to persons acting under the authority of [service] providers of the public communications networks and publicly available electronic communications services handling billing\u2019 and \u2018must be restricted to what is necessary\u2019 for the purposes of such an activity.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from a combined reading of those provisions of Directive 2002/58 that a service provider is authorised to pass traffic data to the assignee of its claims for payment for the purpose of their recovery and that the latter is authorised to process those data on condition, first, that it acts \u2018under the authority\u2019 of the service provider as regards the processing of those data and, second, that it processes only traffic data which are necessary for the purpose of the recovery of those claims.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be stated that neither Directive 2002/58 nor the documents relevant for its interpretation, such as the \ntravaux pr\u00e9paratoires\n, provide clarification as to the exact scope of the concept of \u2018under the authority\u2019. The meaning and scope of terms for which European Union law provides no definition must be determined by considering their usual meaning in everyday language, while also taking into account the context in which they occur and the purposes of the rules of which they are part (see, to that effect, judgments in Case C-336/03 \neasyCar\n [2005] ECR I-1947, paragraphs\u00a020 and 21, and of 5\u00a0July 2012 in Case C-49/11 \nContent Services\n, paragraph\u00a032).\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the usual meaning of those words in everyday language, it must be held that a persons acts under the authority of another where the former acts on instructions and under the control of the latter.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the context in which Article\u00a06 of Directive 2002/58 appears, it must be recalled that Article\u00a05(1) of that directive provides that Member States are required to ensure the confidentiality of communications by means of a public communications network and publicly available electronic communications services and the related traffic data.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06(2) and (5) of Directive 2002/58 contains an exception to the confidentiality of communications laid down in Article\u00a05(1) by authorising traffic data processing in accordance with the requirements of billing services (see, to that effect, Case C-275/06 \nPromusicae\n [2008] ECR I-271, paragraph\u00a048). As it constitutes an exception, that provision of that directive, and therefore also the words \u2018under the authority\u2019, are to be interpreted strictly (see Case C-16/10 \nThe Number (UK) and Conduit Enterprises\n [2011] ECR I-691, paragraph\u00a031). Such an interpretation requires that the service provider has an actual power of supervision which enables him to determine whether the assignee of the claims for payment is acting in compliance with the conditions imposed on it with respect to the processing of traffic data.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is corroborated by the objective of Directive 2002/58 in general and of Article\u00a06(5) in particular. As is clear from its Article\u00a01(1) and (2), Directive 2002/58 particularises and complements Directive 95/46 in the electronic communications sector for the purposes, inter alia, of ensuring an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, Article\u00a06(5) of Directive 2002/58 must be interpreted in the light of similar provisions in Directive 95/46. It is clear from Articles\u00a016 and 17 of Directive 95/46, which set out the level of control that the controller must exercise over the processor which it appoints, that that processor acts only on the controller\u2019s instructions and that the controller ensures compliance with the measures agreed in order to protect personal data against any form of unlawful processing.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objective pursued by Article\u00a06(5) of Directive 2002/58 in particular, it must be stated that, even if that provision authorises the processing of traffic data by certain third persons for the service supplier for the purpose in particular of collecting the latter\u2019s debts, thereby enabling it to concentrate on the supply of electronic communications services, that provision seeks to ensure, by providing that the processing of traffic data must be restricted to persons acting \u2018under the control\u2019 of the service supplier, that such externalisation does not affect the level of protection of personal data enjoyed by the user.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that, regardless of the classification of the contract of assignment of claims for payment for collection purposes, the assignee of a claim for payment relating to the payment of telecommunications charges acts \u2018under the authority\u2019 of the service provider, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(5) of Directive 2002/58, where, for the processing of traffic data that such an activity involves, the assignee acts only on instructions and under the control of the service provider. In particular, the contract concluded between the service provider which assigns its claims for payment and the party to which those claims are assigned must contain provisions of such a kind as to ensure the lawful processing of traffic data by the latter and must allow the service provider to ensure at all times that those provisions are being complied with by the assignee.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for the national court to determine, in the light of all the information in the case-file, whether those conditions are met in the case in the main proceedings. The fact that a factoring contract has the characteristics described in the question referred suggests that that contract satisfies those conditions. Such a contract allows the processing of traffic data by the assignee of claims for payment only in so far as such processing is necessary for the collection of those debts and imposes on that assignee the obligation immediately and irreversibly to erase or return those data as soon as knowledge thereof is no longer necessary for the recovery of the claims concerned. Furthermore, it allows the service provider to check whether there is compliance with the rules on security and data protection on the part of the assignee, which may, on simple request, be obliged to erase or to return the traffic data.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the question referred is that Article\u00a06(2) and (5) of Directive 2002/58 must be interpreted as authorising a service provider to pass traffic data to the assignee of its claims for payment in respect of the supply of telecommunications services for the purpose of recovery of those claims, and as authorising that assignee to process those data on condition, first, that it acts under the authority of the service provider as regards the processing of those data and, second, that that assignee confines itself to processing the traffic data necessary for the purposes of recovering the claims assigned.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Irrespective of the classification of the contract of assignment, the assignee is deemed to act under the authority of the service provider, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(5) of Directive 2002/58, where, for the processing of traffic data, it acts exclusively on the instructions and under the control of that provider. In particular, the contract concluded between them must contain provisions capable of guaranteeing the lawful processing, by the assignee, of the traffic data and of enabling the service provider to ensure, at all times, that that assignee is complying with those provisions.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a06(2) and (5) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) must be interpreted as authorising a provider of public communications networks and of publicly-accessible electronic communications services to pass traffic data to the assignee of its claims for payment in respect of the supply of telecommunications services for the purpose of recovery of those claims, and as authorising that assignee to process those data on condition, first, that the latter acts under the authority of the service provider as regards the processing of those data and, second, that that assignee confines itself to processing the traffic data necessary for the purposes of recovering the claims assigned.\nIrrespective of the classification of the contract of assignment, the assignee is deemed to act under the authority of the service provider, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(5) of Directive 2002/58, where, for the processing of traffic data, it acts exclusively on the instructions and under the control of that provider. In particular, the contract concluded between them must contain provisions capable of guaranteeing the lawful processing, by the assignee, of the traffic data and of enabling the service provider to ensure, at all times, that that assignee is complying with those provisions."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

This Directive is without prejudice to provisions relating to liability in that Directive.\n...\n(59)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the digital environment, in particular, the services of intermediaries may increasingly be used by third parties for infringing activities. In many cases such intermediaries are best placed to bring such infringing activities to an end. Therefore, without prejudice to any other sanctions and remedies available, rightholders should have the possibility of applying for an injunction against an intermediary who carries a third party\u2019s infringement of a protected work or other subject-matter in a network. This possibility should be available even where the acts carried out by the intermediary are exempted under Article 5. The conditions and modalities relating to such injunctions should be left to the national law of the Member States.\u2019 \n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 8 of Directive 2001/29 states:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall provide appropriate sanctions and remedies in respect of infringements of the rights and obligations set out in this Directive and shall take all the measures necessary to ensure that those sanctions and remedies are applied.

The conditions and procedures relating to such injunctions should be left to the national law of the Member States. As far as infringements of copyright and related rights are concerned, a comprehensive level of harmonisation is already provided for in Directive [2001/29]. Article 8(3) of Directive [2001/29] should therefore not be affected by this Directive.\u2019\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 2(3) of Directive 2004/48 provides as follows:\n\u2018This Directive shall not affect:\n(a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Community provisions governing the substantive law on intellectual property \u2026 or Directive [2000/31], in general, and Articles 12 to 15 of Directive [2000/31] in particular;\n\u2026\u2019\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 3 of Directive 2004/48 provides:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall provide for the measures, procedures and remedies necessary to ensure the enforcement of the intellectual property rights covered by this Directive.

Where provided for by national law, non-compliance with an injunction shall, where appropriate, be subject to a recurring penalty payment, with a view to ensuring compliance. Member States shall also ensure that rightholders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right, without prejudice to Article 8(3) of Directive [2001/29].\u2019\n\u00a0\nNational law\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 87(1), first and second subparagraphs, of the Law of 30\u00a0June 1994 on copyright and related rights (\nMoniteur belge \nof 27\u00a0July 1994, p.\u00a019297) states: \n\u2018The President of the Tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance (Court of First Instance) \u2026 shall determine the existence of any infringement of a copyright or related right and shall order that it be brought to an end.\nHe may also issue an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.\u2019 \n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 18 and 21 of the Law of 11\u00a0March 2003 on certain legal aspects of information society services (\nMoniteur belge \nof 17\u00a0March 2003, p.\u00a012962) transpose Articles 12 and 15 of Directive 2000/31 into national law. \n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling \n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SABAM is a management company which represents authors, composers and editors of musical works in authorising the use of their copyright-protected works by third parties. \n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scarlet is an internet service provider (\u2018ISP\u2019) which provides its customers with access to the internet without offering other services such as downloading or file sharing. \n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the course of 2004, SABAM concluded that internet users using Scarlet\u2019s services were downloading works in SABAM\u2019s catalogue from the internet, without authorisation and without paying royalties, by means of peer-to-peer networks, which constitute a transparent method of file sharing which is independent, decentralised and features advanced search and download functions. \n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 24\u00a0June 2004, SABAM accordingly brought interlocutory proceedings against Scarlet before the President of the Tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance, Brussels, claiming that that company was the best placed, as an ISP, to take measures to bring to an end copyright infringements committed by its customers. \n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SABAM sought, first, a declaration that the copyright in musical works contained in its repertoire had been infringed, in particular the right of reproduction and the right of communication to the public, because of the unauthorised sharing of electronic music files by means of peer-to-peer software, those infringements being committed through the use of Scarlet\u2019s services.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SABAM also sought an order requiring Scarlet to bring such infringements to an end by blocking, or making it impossible for its customers to send or receive in any way, files containing a musical work using peer-to-peer software without the permission of the rightholders, on pain of a periodic penalty. Lastly, SABAM requested that Scarlet provide it with details of the measures that it would be applying in order to comply with the judgment to be given, on pain of a periodic penalty.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By judgment of 26\u00a0November 2004, the President of the Tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance, Brussels, found that copyright had been infringed, as claimed by SABAM, but, prior to ruling on the application for cessation, appointed an expert to investigate whether the technical solutions proposed by SABAM were technically feasible, whether they would make it possible to filter out only unlawful file sharing, and whether there were other ways of monitoring the use of peer-to-peer software, and to determine the cost of the measures envisaged.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his report, the appointed expert concluded that, despite numerous technical obstacles, the feasibility of filtering and blocking the unlawful sharing of electronic files could not be entirely ruled out. \n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By judgment of 29\u00a0June 2007, the President of the Tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance, Brussels, accordingly ordered Scarlet to bring to an end the copyright infringements established in the judgment of 26\u00a0November 2004 by making it impossible for its customers to send or receive in any way files containing a musical work in SABAM\u2019s repertoire by means of peer-to-peer software, on pain of a periodic penalty. \n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scarlet appealed against that decision to the referring court, claiming, first, that it was impossible for it to comply with that injunction since the effectiveness and permanence of filtering and blocking systems had not been proved and that the installation of the equipment for so doing was faced with numerous practical obstacles, such as problems with the network capacity and the impact on the network. Moreover, any attempt to block the files concerned was, it argued, doomed to fail in the very short term because there were at that time several peer-to-peer software products which made it impossible for third parties to check their content.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scarlet also claimed that that injunction was contrary to Article 21 of the Law of 11\u00a0March 2003 on certain legal aspects of information society services, which transposes Article 15 of Directive 2000/31 into national law, because it would impose on Scarlet, \nde facto\n, a general obligation to monitor communications on its network, inasmuch as any system for blocking or filtering peer-to-peer traffic would necessarily require general surveillance of all the communications passing through its network.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, Scarlet considered that the installation of a filtering system would be in breach of the provisions of European Union law on the protection of personal data and the secrecy of communications, since such filtering involves the processing of IP addresses, which are personal data. \n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the referring court took the view that, before ascertaining whether a mechanism for filtering and blocking peer-to-peer files existed and could be effective, it had to be satisfied that the obligations liable to be imposed on Scarlet were in accordance with European Union law. \n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the cour d\u2019appel de Bruxelles decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do Directives 2001/29 and 2004/48, in conjunction with Directives 95/46, 2000/31 and 2002/58, construed in particular in the light of Articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, permit Member States to authorise a national court, before which substantive proceedings have been brought and on the basis merely of a statutory provision stating that: \u2018They [the national courts] may also issue an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right\u2019, to order an [ISP] to install, for all its customers, in abstracto and as a preventive measure, exclusively at the cost of that ISP and for an unlimited period, a system for filtering all electronic communications, both incoming and outgoing, passing via its services, in particular those involving the use of peer-to-peer software, in order to identify on its network the movement of electronic files containing a musical, cinematographic or audio-visual work in respect of which the applicant claims to hold rights, and subsequently to block the transfer of such files, either at the point at which they are requested or at which they are sent?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the answer to the [first] question \u2026 is in the affirmative, do those directives require a national court, called upon to give a ruling on an application for an injunction against an intermediary whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright, to apply the principle of proportionality when deciding on the effectiveness and dissuasive effect of the measure sought?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its questions, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directives 2000/31, 2001/29, 2004/48, 95/46 and 2002/58, read together and construed in the light of the requirements stemming from the protection of the applicable fundamental rights, must be interpreted as precluding an injunction imposed on an ISP to introduce a system for filtering\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0all electronic communications passing via its services, in particular those involving the use of peer-to-peer software; \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0which applies indiscriminately to all its customers; \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a preventive measure; \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0exclusively at its expense; and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for an unlimited period, \nwhich is capable of identifying on that provider\u2019s network the movement of electronic files containing a musical, cinematographic or audio-visual work in respect of which the applicant claims to hold intellectual property rights, with a view to blocking the transfer of files the sharing of which infringes copyright (\u2018the contested filtering system\u2019).\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should first be recalled that, under Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29 and the third sentence of Article 11 of Directive 2004/48, holders of intellectual property rights may apply for an injunction against intermediaries, such as ISPs, whose services are being used by a third party to infringe their rights.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, it follows from the Court\u2019s case-law that the jurisdiction conferred on national courts, in accordance with those provisions, must allow them to order those intermediaries to take measures aimed not only at bringing to an end infringements already committed against intellectual-property rights using their information-society services, but also at preventing further infringements (see, to that effect, Case C-324/09 \nL\u2019Or\u00e9al and Others \n[2011] ECR I-0000, paragraph 131).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, it follows from that same case-law that the rules for the operation of the injunctions for which the Member States must provide under Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29 and the third sentence of Article 11 of Directive 2004/48, such as those relating to the conditions to be met and to the procedure to be followed, are a matter for national law (see, \nmutatis mutandis\n, \nL\u2019Or\u00e9al and Others\n, paragraph 135). \n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, those national rules, and likewise their application by the national courts, must observe the limitations arising from Directives 2001/29 and 2004/48 and from the sources of law to which those directives refer (see, to that effect, \nL\u2019Or\u00e9al and Others\n, paragraph 138). \n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in accordance with recital 16 in the preamble to Directive 2001/29 and Article 2(3)(a) of Directive 2004/48, those rules laid down by the Member States may not affect the provisions of Directive 2000/31 and, more specifically, Articles 12 to 15 thereof. \n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, those rules must, in particular, respect Article 15(1) of Directive 2000/31, which prohibits national authorities from adopting measures which would require an ISP to carry out general monitoring of the information that it transmits on its network. \n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court has already ruled that that prohibition applies in particular to national measures which would require an intermediary provider, such as an ISP, to actively monitor all the data of each of its customers in order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual-property rights. Furthermore, such a general monitoring obligation would be incompatible with Article 3 of Directive 2004/48, which states that the measures referred to by the directive must be fair and proportionate and must not be excessively costly (see \nL\u2019Or\u00e9al and Others\n, paragraph 139). \n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it is necessary to examine whether the injunction at issue in the main proceedings, which would require the ISP to install the contested filtering system, would oblige it, as part of that system, to actively monitor all the data of each of its customers in order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual-property rights. \n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is common ground that implementation of that filtering system would require\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0first, that the ISP identify, within all of the electronic communications of all its customers, the files relating to peer-to-peer traffic;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0secondly, that it identify, within that traffic, the files containing works in respect of which holders of intellectual-property rights claim to hold rights;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0thirdly, that it determine which of those files are being shared unlawfully; and \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fourthly, that it block file sharing that it considers to be unlawful. \n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preventive monitoring of this kind would thus require active observation of all electronic communications conducted on the network of the ISP concerned and, consequently, would encompass all information to be transmitted and all customers using that network. \n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, it must be held that the injunction imposed on the ISP concerned requiring it to install the contested filtering system would oblige it to actively monitor all the data relating to each of its customers in order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual-property rights. It follows that that injunction would require the ISP to carry out general monitoring, something which is prohibited by Article 15(1) of Directive 2000/31. \n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to assess whether that injunction is consistent with European Union law, account must also be taken of the requirements that stem from the protection of the applicable fundamental rights, such as those mentioned by the referring court. \n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be recalled that the injunction at issue in the main proceedings pursues the aim of ensuring the protection of copyright, which is an intellectual-property right, which may be infringed by the nature and content of certain electronic communications conducted through the network of the ISP concerned. \n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The protection of the right to intellectual property is indeed enshrined in Article\u00a017(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019). There is, however, nothing whatsoever in the wording of that provision or in the Court\u2019s case-law to suggest that that right is inviolable and must for that reason be absolutely protected. \n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As paragraphs 62 to 68 of the judgment in Case C-275/06 \nPromusicae\n [2008] ECR I-271 make clear, the protection of the fundamental right to property, which includes the rights linked to intellectual property, must be balanced against the protection of other fundamental rights. \n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, it follows from paragraph 68 of that judgment that, in the context of measures adopted to protect copyright holders, national authorities and courts must strike a fair balance between the protection of copyright and the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures. \n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, national authorities and courts must, in particular, strike a fair balance between the protection of the intellectual property right enjoyed by copyright holders and that of the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as ISPs pursuant to Article 16 of the Charter.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the injunction requiring the installation of the contested filtering system involves monitoring all the electronic communications made through the network of the ISP concerned in the interests of those rightholders. Moreover, that monitoring has no limitation in time, is directed at all future infringements and is intended to protect not only existing works, but also future works that have not yet been created at the time when the system is introduced. \n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, such an injunction would result in a serious infringement of the freedom of the ISP concerned to conduct its business since it would require that ISP to install a complicated, costly, permanent computer system at its own expense, which would also be contrary to the conditions laid down in Article 3(1) of Directive 2004/48, which requires that measures to ensure the respect of intellectual-property rights should not be unnecessarily complicated or costly. \n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it must be held that the injunction to install the contested filtering system is to be regarded as not respecting the requirement that a fair balance be struck between, on the one hand, the protection of the intellectual-property right enjoyed by copyright holders, and, on the other hand, that of the freedom to conduct business enjoyed by operators such as ISPs. \n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the effects of that injunction would not be limited to the ISP concerned, as the contested filtering system may also infringe the fundamental rights of that ISP\u2019s customers, namely their right to protection of their personal data and their freedom to receive or impart information, which are rights safeguarded by Articles 8 and 11 of the Charter respectively. \n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is common ground, first, that the injunction requiring installation of the contested filtering system would involve a systematic analysis of all content and the collection and identification of users\u2019 IP addresses from which unlawful content on the network is sent. Those addresses are protected personal data because they allow those users to be precisely identified. \n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, that injunction could potentially undermine freedom of information since that system might not distinguish adequately between unlawful content and lawful content, with the result that its introduction could lead to the blocking of lawful communications. Indeed, it is not contested that the reply to the question whether a transmission is lawful also depends on the application of statutory exceptions to copyright which vary from one Member State to another. Moreover, in some Member States certain works fall within the public domain or can be posted online free of charge by the authors concerned. \n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, it must be held that, in adopting the injunction requiring the ISP to install the contested filtering system, the national court concerned would not be respecting the requirement that a fair balance be struck between the right to intellectual property, on the one hand, and the freedom to conduct business, the right to protection of personal data and the freedom to receive or impart information, on the other. \n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the questions submitted is that Directives 2000/31, 2001/29, 2004/48, 95/46 and 2002/58, read together and construed in the light of the requirements stemming from the protection of the applicable fundamental rights, must be interpreted as precluding an injunction made against an ISP which requires it to install the contested filtering system. \n\u00a0\nCosts\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\nDirectives:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8\u00a0June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (\u2018Directive on electronic commerce\u2019);\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22\u00a0May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29\u00a0April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights ; \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data; and \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), \nread together and construed in the light of the requirements stemming from the protection of the applicable fundamental rights, must be interpreted as precluding an injunction made against an internet service provider which requires it to install a system for filtering\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nall electronic communications passing via its services, in particular those involving the use of peer-to-peer software; \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich applies indiscriminately to all its customers; \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nas a preventive measure; \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nexclusively at its expense; and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nfor an unlimited period, \nwhich is capable of identifying on that provider\u2019s network the movement of electronic files containing a musical, cinematographic or audio-visual work in respect of which the applicant claims to hold intellectual-property rights, with a view to blocking the transfer of files the sharing of which infringes copyright."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 24 Sep 2019, C-507/17 (\nGoogle\n)\nGeneral data protection law \n >

interpretation of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ 1995 L\u00a0281, p.\u00a031).\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The request has been made in proceedings between Google LLC, successor in law to Google

context\n\u00a0\nEuropean Union law\n\u00a0\nDirective 95/46\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Article\u00a01(1) thereof, the purpose of Directive 95/46 is to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data, and to remove obstacles to the free movement of such data.\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a02, 7, 10, 18, 20 and 37 of Directive 95/46 state:\n\u2018(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas data-processing systems are designed to serve man; whereas they must, whatever the nationality or residence of natural persons, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, and contribute to\u00a0\u2026 the well-being of individuals;\n\u2026 \n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the difference in levels of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, notably the right to privacy, with regard to the processing of personal data afforded in the Member States may prevent the transmission of such data from the territory of one Member State to that of another Member State; whereas this difference may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of a number of economic activities at Community level\u00a0\u2026 \n\u2026 \n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the object of the national laws on the processing of personal data is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, which is recognised both in Article\u00a08 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms[, signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950,] and in the general principles of Community law; whereas, for that reason, the approximation of those laws must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community;\n\u2026 \n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas, in order to ensure that individuals are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this Directive, any processing of personal data in the Community must be carried out in accordance with the law of one of the Member States;\u00a0\u2026 \n\u2026 \n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the fact that the processing of data is carried out by a person established in a third country must not stand in the way of the protection of individuals provided for in this Directive; whereas in these cases, the processing should be governed by the law of the Member State in which the means used are located, and there should be guarantees to ensure that the rights and obligations provided for in this Directive are respected in practice;\n\u2026 \n(37)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the processing of personal data for purposes of journalism or for purposes of literary [or] artistic expression, in particular in the audiovisual field, should qualify for exemption from the requirements of certain provisions of this Directive in so far as this is necessary to reconcile the fundamental rights of individuals with freedom of information and notably the right to receive and impart information, as guaranteed in particular in Article\u00a010 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; whereas Member States should therefore lay down exemptions and derogations necessary for the purpose of balance between fundamental rights as regards general measures on the legitimacy of data processing\u00a0\u2026\u2019\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a02 of that directive provides:\n\u2018For the purposes of this

national law applicable;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the controller is not established on the Member State\u2019s territory, but in a place where its national law applies by virtue of international public law;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the controller is not established on Community territory and, for purposes of processing personal data makes use of equipment, automated or otherwise, situated on the territory of the said Member State, unless such equipment is used only for purposes of transit through the territory of the Community.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the circumstances referred to in paragraph\u00a01(c), the controller must designate a representative established in the territory of that Member

\u2018Processing of personal data and freedom of expression\u2019, states:\n\u2018Member States shall provide for exemptions or derogations from the provisions of this Chapter, Chapter IV and Chapter VI for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression only if they are necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression.\u2019\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a012 of that directive, entitled \u2018Right of access\u2019, provides:\n\u2018Member States shall guarantee every data subject the right to obtain from the controller:\n\u2026 \n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as appropriate the rectification, erasure or blocking of data the processing of which does not comply with the provisions of this Directive, in particular because of the incomplete or inaccurate nature of the

shall grant the data subject the right:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0at least in the cases referred to in Article\u00a07(e) and (f), to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation to the processing of data relating to him, save where otherwise provided by national legislation. Where there is a justified objection, the processing instigated by the controller may no longer involve those data;\n\u2026\u2019\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a024 of Directive 95/46, entitled \u2018Sanctions\u2019, provides:\n\u2018The Member States shall adopt suitable measures to ensure the full implementation of the provisions of this Directive and shall in particular lay down the sanctions to be imposed in case of infringement of the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive.\u2019\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a028 of that directive, entitled \u2018Supervisory authority\u2019, is worded as follows:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Member State shall provide that one or more public authorities are responsible for monitoring the application within its territory of the provisions adopted by the Member States pursuant to this Directive.\n\u2026 \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each authority shall in particular be endowed with:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0investigative powers, such as powers of access to data forming the subject matter of processing operations and powers to collect all the information necessary for the performance of its supervisory duties,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0effective powers of intervention, such as, for example, that of\u00a0\u2026 ordering the blocking, erasure or destruction of data, [or] of imposing a temporary or definitive ban on processing\u00a0\u2026 \n\u2026 \nDecisions by the supervisory authority which give rise to complaints may be appealed against through the courts.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each supervisory authority shall hear claims lodged by any person, or by an association representing that person, concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal data.

Article\u00a094(1) of that regulation provides that Directive 95/46 is repealed with effect from that date.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a01, 4, 9 to 11, 13, 22 to 25 and 65 of that regulation state:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right. Article\u00a08(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u201cthe Charter\u201d) and Article\u00a016(1) [TFEU] provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\n\u2026 \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular the respect for private and family life,\u00a0\u2026 the protection of personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information [and] freedom to conduct a business\u00a0\u2026 \n\u2026 \n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 Directive 95/46\u00a0\u2026 has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation of data protection across the Union\u00a0\u2026 Differences in the level of protection\u00a0\u2026 in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union\u00a0\u2026\n(10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States.\u00a0\u2026\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States.\n\u2026 \n(13)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators,\u00a0\u2026 and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.\u00a0\u2026 \n\u2026 \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself takes place within the Union.\u00a0\u2026\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this Regulation, the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not established in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union.\u00a0\u2026\n(24)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.

Where the search is conducted from \u2018google.com\u2019, Google, in principle, automatically redirects that search to the domain name corresponding to the State from which that search is deemed to have been made, as identified by the internet user\u2019s IP address. However, regardless of his or her location, the internet user remains free to conduct his or her searches using the search engine\u2019s other domain names. Moreover, although the results may differ depending on the domain name from which the search is conducted on the search engine, it is common ground that the links displayed in response to a search derive from common databases and common indexing.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat considers that, having regard, first, to the fact that Google\u2019s search engine domain names can all be accessed from French territory and, secondly, to the existence of gateways between those various domain names, as illustrated in particular by the automatic redirection mentioned above, as well as by the presence of cookies on extensions of that search engine other than the one on which they were initially deposited, that search engine, which, moreover, has been the subject of only one declaration to the CNIL, must be regarded as carrying out a single act of personal data processing for the purposes of applying the Law of 6\u00a0January 1978. As a result, the processing of personal data by the search engine operated by Google is carried out within the framework of one of its installations, Google France, established on French territory, and is therefore subject to the Law of 6\u00a0January 1978.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat, Google maintains that the penalty at issue is based on a misinterpretation of the provisions of the Law of 6\u00a0January 1978, which transpose Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46, on the basis of which the Court, in its judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n (C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317), recognised a \u2018right to de-referencing\u2019. Google argues that this right does not necessarily require that the links at issue are to be removed, without geographical limitation, from all its search engine\u2019s domain names. In addition, by adopting such an interpretation, the CNIL disregarded the principles of courtesy and non-interference recognised by public international law and disproportionately infringed the freedoms of expression, information, communication and the press guaranteed, in particular, by Article\u00a011 of the Charter.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having noted that this line of argument raises several serious difficulties regarding the interpretation of Directive 95/46, the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat has decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must the \u201cright to de-referencing\u201d, as established by the [Court] in its judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, [\nGoogle Spain and Google\n (C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317),] on the basis of the provisions of [Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014] of Directive [95/46], be interpreted as meaning that a search engine operator is required, when granting a request for de-referencing, to deploy the de-referencing to all of the domain names used by its search engine so that the links at issue no longer appear, irrespective of the place from where the search initiated on the basis of the requester\u2019s name is conducted, and even if it is conducted from a place outside the territorial scope of Directive [95/46]?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that Question 1 is answered in the negative, must the \u201cright to de-referencing\u201d, as established by the [Court] in the judgment cited above, be interpreted as meaning that a search engine operator is required, when granting a request for de-referencing, only to remove the links at issue from the results displayed following a search conducted on the basis of the requester\u2019s name on the domain name corresponding to the State in which the request is deemed to have been made or, more generally, on the domain names distinguished by the national extensions used by that search engine for all of the Member States\u00a0\u2026?\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, in addition to the obligation mentioned in Question 2, must the \u201cright to de-referencing\u201d as established by the [Court] in its judgment cited above, be interpreted as meaning that a search engine operator is required, when granting a request for de-referencing, to remove the results at issue, by using the \u201cgeo-blocking\u201d technique, from searches conducted on the basis of the requester\u2019s name from an IP address deemed to be located in the State of residence of the person benefiting from the \u201cright to de-referencing\u201d, or even, more generally, from an IP address deemed to be located in one of the Member States subject to Directive [95/46], regardless of the domain name used by the internet user conducting the search?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The case in the main proceedings is the result of a dispute between Google and the CNIL as to how a search engine operator, where it establishes that a data subject is entitled to have one or more links to web pages containing personal data concerning him or her removed from the list of results which is displayed following a search conducted on the basis of his or her name, is to give effect to that right to de-referencing. Although Directive 95/46 was applicable on the date the request for a preliminary ruling was made, it was repealed with effect from 25\u00a0May 2018, from which date Regulation 2016/679 is applicable.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court will examine the questions referred in the light of both that directive and that regulation in order to ensure that its answers will be of use to the referring court in any event.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the proceedings before the Court, Google explained that, following the bringing of the request for a preliminary ruling, it has implemented a new layout for the national versions of its search engine, in which the domain name entered by the internet user no longer determines the national version of the search engine accessed by that user. Thus, the internet user is now automatically directed to the national version of Google\u2019s search engine that corresponds to the place from where he or she is presumed to be conducting the search, and the results of that search are displayed according to that place, which is determined by Google using a geo-location process.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the questions referred, which must be dealt with together, should be understood as seeking to ascertain, in essence, whether Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a017(1) of Regulation 2016/679 are to be interpreted as meaning that, where a search engine operator grants a request for de-referencing pursuant to those provisions, that operator is required to carry out that de-referencing on all versions of its search engine, or whether, on the contrary, it is required to do so only on the versions of that search engine corresponding to all the Member States, or even only on the version corresponding to the Member State in which the request for de-referencing was made, using, where appropriate, the technique known as \u2018geo-blocking\u2019 in order to ensure that an internet user cannot, regardless of the national version of the search engine used, gain access to the links concerned by the de-referencing in the context of a search conducted from an IP address deemed to be located in the Member State of residence of the person benefiting from the right to de-referencing or, more broadly, in any Member State.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be borne in mind that the Court has held that Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 are to be interpreted as meaning that, in order to comply with the rights laid down in those provisions and in so far as the conditions laid down by those provisions are in fact satisfied, the operator of a search engine is obliged to remove from the list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of a person\u2019s name links to web pages, published by third parties and containing information relating to that person, also in a case where that name or information is not erased beforehand or simultaneously from those web pages, and even, as the case may be, when its publication in itself on those pages is lawful (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a088).\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has also stated that, when appraising the conditions for the application of those same provisions, it should inter alia be examined whether the data subject has a right that the information in question relating to him or her personally should, at that point in time, no longer be linked to his or her name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his or her name, without it being necessary in order to find such a right that the inclusion of the information in question in that list causes prejudice to the data subject. As the data subject may, in the light of his or her fundamental rights under Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, request that the information in question no longer be made available to the general public on account of its inclusion in such a list of results, those rights override, as a rule, not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in having access to that information upon a search relating to the data subject\u2019s name. However, that would not be the case if it appeared, for particular reasons, such as the role played by the data subject in public life, that the interference with his or her fundamental rights is justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having, on account of its inclusion in the list of results, access to the information in question (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a099).\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the context of Regulation 2016/679, that right of a data subject to de-referencing is now based on Article\u00a017 of that regulation, which specifically governs the \u2018right to erasure\u2019, also referred to, in the heading of that article, as the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Article\u00a017(1) of Regulation 2016/679, a data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller has the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the grounds listed in that provision applies. Article\u00a017(3) of that regulation specifies that Article\u00a017(1) does not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for one of the reasons listed in the former provision. Those reasons include, in particular, under Article\u00a017(3)(a) of that regulation, the exercise of the right of, inter alia, freedom of information of internet users.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a03(1) of Regulation 2016/679 that both that directive and that regulation permit data subjects to assert their right to de-referencing against a search engine operator who has one or more establishments in the territory of the Union in the context of activities involving the processing of personal data concerning those data subjects, regardless of whether that processing takes place in the Union or not.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court has held that the processing of personal data is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of a Member State when the operator of a search engine sets up in a Member State a branch or subsidiary which is intended to promote and sell advertising space offered by that search engine and which orientates its activity towards the inhabitants of that Member State (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a060).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In such circumstances, the activities of the operator of the search engine and those of its establishment situated in the Union are inextricably linked since the activities relating to the advertising space constitute the means of rendering the search engine at issue economically profitable and that search engine is, at the same time, the means enabling those activities to be performed, the display of the list of results being accompanied, on the same page, by the display of advertising linked to the search terms (see, to that effect, judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraphs\u00a056 and 57).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, the fact that the search engine is operated by an undertaking that has its seat in a third State cannot result in the processing of personal data carried out for the purposes of the operation of that search engine in the context of the advertising and commercial activity of an establishment of the controller on the territory of a Member State escaping the obligations and guarantees laid down by Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679 (see, to that effect, judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a058).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the information provided in the order for reference, first, that Google\u2019s establishment in French territory carries on, inter alia, commercial and advertising activities, which are inextricably linked to the processing of personal data carried out for the purposes of operating the search engine concerned, and, second, that that search engine must, in view of, inter alia, the existence of gateways between its various national versions, be regarded as carrying out a single act of personal data processing. The referring court considers that, in those circumstances, that act of processing is carried out within the framework of Google\u2019s establishment in French territory. It thus appears that such a situation falls within the territorial scope of Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its questions, the referring court seeks to determine the territorial scope which must be conferred on a de-referencing in such a situation.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is apparent from recital\u00a010 of Directive 95/46 and recitals\u00a010, 11 and 13 of Regulation 2016/679, which was adopted on the basis of Article\u00a016 TFEU, that the objective of that directive and that regulation is to guarantee a high level of protection of personal data throughout the European Union.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that a de-referencing carried out on all the versions of a search engine would meet that objective in full.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The internet is a global network without borders and search engines render the information and links contained in a list of results displayed following a search conducted on the basis of an individual\u2019s name ubiquitous (see, to that effect, judgments of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a080, and of 17\u00a0October 2017, \nBolagsupplysningen and Ilsjan\n, C-194/16, EU:C:2017:766, paragraph\u00a048).\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a globalised world, internet users\u2019 access\u00a0\u2014 including those outside the Union\u00a0\u2014 to the referencing of a link referring to information regarding a person whose centre of interests is situated in the Union is thus likely to have immediate and substantial effects on that person within the Union itself.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such considerations are such as to justify the existence of a competence on the part of the EU legislature to lay down the obligation, for a search engine operator, to carry out, when granting a request for de-referencing made by such a person, a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being said, it should be emphasised that numerous third States do not recognise the right to de-referencing or have a different approach to that right.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right, but must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality (see, to that effect, judgment of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraph\u00a048, and Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, point\u00a0136). Furthermore, the balance between the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, on the one hand, and the freedom of information of internet users, on the other, is likely to vary significantly around the world.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the EU legislature has, in Article\u00a017(3)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, struck a balance between that right and that freedom so far as the Union is concerned (see, to that effect, today\u2019s judgment, \nGC and Others \n(De-referencing of sensitive data)\n, C-136/17, paragraph\u00a059), it must be found that, by contrast, it has not, to date, struck such a balance as regards the scope of a de-referencing outside the Union.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, it is in no way apparent from the wording of Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 or Article\u00a017 of Regulation 2016/679 that the EU legislature would, for the purposes of ensuring that the objective referred to in paragraph\u00a054 above is met, have chosen to confer a scope on the rights enshrined in those provisions which would go beyond the territory of the Member States and that it would have intended to impose on an operator which, like Google, falls within the scope of that directive or that regulation a de-referencing obligation which also concerns the national versions of its search engine that do not correspond to the Member States.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, although Regulation 2016/679 provides the supervisory authorities of the Member States, in Articles\u00a056 and 60 to 66 thereof, with the instruments and mechanisms enabling them, where appropriate, to cooperate in order to come to a joint decision based on weighing a data subject\u2019s right to privacy and the protection of personal data concerning him or her against the interest of the public in various Member States in having access to information, it must be found that EU law does not currently provide for such cooperation instruments and mechanisms as regards the scope of a de-referencing outside the Union.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, currently, there is no obligation under EU law, for a search engine operator who grants a request for de-referencing made by a data subject, as the case may be, following an injunction from a supervisory or judicial authority of a Member State, to carry out such a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to all of the foregoing, a search engine operator cannot be required, under Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a017(1) of Regulation 2016/679, to carry out a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the question whether such a de-referencing is to be carried out on the versions of the search engine corresponding to the Member States or only on the version of that search engine corresponding to the Member State of residence of the person benefiting from the de-referencing, it follows from, inter alia, the fact that the EU legislature has now chosen to lay down the rules concerning data protection by way of a regulation, which is directly applicable in all the Member States, which has been done, as is emphasised by recital\u00a010 of Regulation 2016/679, in order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection throughout the European Union and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, that the de-referencing in question is, in principle, supposed to be carried out in respect of all the Member States.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it should be pointed out that the interest of the public in accessing information may, even within the Union, vary from one Member State to another, meaning that the result of weighing up that interest, on the one hand, and a data subject\u2019s rights to privacy and the protection of personal data, on the other, is not necessarily the same for all the Member States, especially since, under Article\u00a09 of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a085 of Regulation 2016/679, it is for the Member States, in particular as regards processing undertaken solely for journalistic purposes or for the purpose of artistic or literary expression, to provide for the exemptions and derogations necessary to reconcile those rights with, inter alia, the freedom of information.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from, inter alia, Articles\u00a056 and 60 of Regulation 2016/679 that, for cross-border processing as defined in Article\u00a04(23) of that regulation, and subject to Article\u00a056(2) thereof, the various national supervisory authorities concerned must cooperate, in accordance with the procedure laid down in those provisions, in order to reach a consensus and a single decision which is binding on all those authorities and with which the controller must ensure compliance as regards processing activities in the context of all its establishments in the Union. Moreover, Article\u00a061(1) of Regulation 2016/679 obliges the supervisory authorities, in particular, to provide each other with relevant information and mutual assistance in order to implement and to apply that regulation in a consistent manner throughout the Union, and Article\u00a063 of that regulation specifies that it is for this purpose that provision has been made for the consistency mechanism set out in Articles\u00a064 and 65 thereof. Lastly, the urgency procedure provided for in Article\u00a066 of Regulation 2016/679 permits the immediate adoption, in exceptional circumstances, where a supervisory authority concerned considers that there is an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, of provisional measures intended to produce legal effects on its own territory with a specified period of validity which is not to exceed three months.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That regulatory framework thus provides the national supervisory authorities with the instruments and mechanisms necessary to reconcile a data subject\u2019s rights to privacy and the protection of personal data with the interest of the whole public throughout the Member States in accessing the information in question and, accordingly, to be able to adopt, where appropriate, a de-referencing decision which covers all searches conducted from the territory of the Union on the basis of that data subject\u2019s name.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it is for the search engine operator to take, if necessary, sufficiently effective measures to ensure the effective protection of the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights. Those measures must themselves meet all the legal requirements and have the effect of preventing or, at the very least, seriously discouraging internet users in the Member States from gaining access to the links in question using a search conducted on the basis of that data subject\u2019s name (see, by analogy, judgments of 27\u00a0March 2014, \nUPC Telekabel Wien\n, C-314/12, EU:C:2014:192, paragraph\u00a062, and of 15\u00a0September 2016, \nMcFadden\n, C-484/14, EU:C:2016:689, paragraph\u00a096).\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is for the referring court to ascertain whether, also having regard to the recent changes made to its search engine as set out in paragraph\u00a042 above, the measures adopted or proposed by Google meet those requirements.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, it should be emphasised that, while, as noted in paragraph\u00a064 above, EU law does not currently require that the de-referencing granted concern all versions of the search engine in question, it also does not prohibit such a practice. Accordingly, a supervisory or judicial authority of a Member State remains competent to weigh up, in the light of national standards of protection of fundamental rights (see, to that effect, judgments of 26\u00a0February 2013, \n\u00c5kerberg Fransson\n, C-617/10, EU:C:2013:105, paragraph\u00a029, and of 26\u00a0February 2013, \nMelloni\n, C-399/11, EU:C:2013:107, paragraph\u00a060), a data subject\u2019s right to privacy and the protection of personal data concerning him or her, on the one hand, and the right to freedom of information, on the other, and, after weighing those rights against each other, to order, where appropriate, the operator of that search engine to carry out a de-referencing concerning all versions of that search engine.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all of the foregoing, the answer to the questions referred is that, on a proper construction of Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a017(1) of Regulation 2016/679, where a search engine operator grants a request for de-referencing pursuant to those provisions, that operator is not required to carry out that de-referencing on all versions of its search engine, but on the versions of that search engine corresponding to all the Member States, using, where necessary, measures which, while meeting the legal requirements, effectively prevent or, at the very least, seriously discourage an internet user conducting a search from one of the Member States on the basis of a data subject\u2019s name from gaining access, via the list of results displayed following that search, to the links which are the subject of that request.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\nOn a proper construction of Article\u00a012(b) and subparagraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article\u00a014 of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and of Article\u00a017(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 (General Data Protection Regulation), where a search engine operator grants a request for de-referencing pursuant to those provisions, that operator is not required to carry out that de-referencing on all versions of its search engine, but on the versions of that search engine corresponding to all the Member States, using, where necessary, measures which, while meeting the legal requirements, effectively prevent or, at the very least, seriously discourage an internet user conducting a search from one of the Member States on the basis of a data subject\u2019s name from gaining access, via the list of results displayed following that search, to the links which are the subject of that request."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}
