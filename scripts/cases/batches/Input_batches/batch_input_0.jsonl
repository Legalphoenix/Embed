That directive introduced an obligation to report any potentially aggressive tax-planning cross-border tax arrangements to the competent authorities. In that regard, recitals\u00a02, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 18 of Directive 2018/822 state the following:\n\u2018(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States find it increasingly difficult to protect their national tax bases from erosion as tax-planning structures have evolved to be particularly sophisticated and often take advantage of the increased mobility of both capital and persons within the internal market.\u00a0\u2026 It is therefore critical that Member States\u2019 tax authorities obtain comprehensive and relevant information about potentially aggressive tax arrangements. Such information would enable those authorities to react promptly against harmful tax practices and to close loopholes by enacting legislation or by undertaking adequate risk assessments and carrying out tax audits.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recognising how a transparent framework for developing business activity could contribute to clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion in the internal market, the [European] Commission has been called on to embark on initiatives on the mandatory disclosure of information on potentially aggressive tax-planning arrangements along the lines of Action 12 of the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)] Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project. In this context, the European Parliament has called for tougher measures against intermediaries who assist in arrangements that may lead to tax avoidance and evasion. It is also important to note that in the G7 Bari Declaration of 13\u00a0May 2017 on fighting tax crimes and other illicit financial flows, the OECD was asked to start discussing possible ways to address arrangements designed to circumvent reporting under the [Common Reporting Standard (CRS)] or aimed at providing beneficial owners with the shelter of non-transparent structures, considering also model mandatory disclosure rules inspired by the approach taken for avoidance arrangements outlined within the BEPS Action 12 Report.\n\u2026\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reporting of potentially aggressive cross-border tax-planning arrangements can contribute effectively to the efforts for creating an environment of fair taxation in the internal market. In this light, an obligation for intermediaries to inform tax authorities\u00a0\u2026 would constitute a step in the right direction.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and to prevent loopholes in the proposed framework of rules, the reporting obligation should be placed upon all actors that are usually involved in designing, marketing, organising or managing the implementation of a reportable cross-border transaction or a series of such transactions, as well as those who provide assistance or advice. It should not be ignored either that, in certain cases, the reporting obligation would not be enforceable upon an intermediary due to a legal professional privilege or where there is no intermediary because, for instance, the taxpayer designs and implements a scheme in-house. It would thus be crucial that, in such circumstances, tax authorities do not lose the opportunity to receive information about tax-related arrangements that are potentially linked to aggressive tax planning. It would therefore be necessary to shift the reporting obligation to the taxpayer who benefits from the arrangement in such cases.\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aggressive tax-planning arrangements have evolved over the years to become increasingly more complex and are always subject to constant modifications and adjustments as a reaction to defensive countermeasures by the tax authorities. Taking this into consideration, it would be more effective to endeavour to capture potentially aggressive tax-planning arrangements through the compiling of a list of the features and elements of transactions that present a strong indication of tax avoidance or abuse rather than to define the concept of aggressive tax planning. Those indications are referred to as \u201challmarks\u201d.\n\u2026\n(18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter\u00a0\u2026\u2019\nAmended Directive 2011/16\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03 of amended Directive 2011/16 entitled \u2018Definitions\u2019 provides:\n\u2018For the purposes of this Directive the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201ccompetent authority\u201d of a Member State means the authority which has been designated as such by that Member State.

It transposes Article\u00a08ab(5) and (6) of amended Directive 2011/16. Paragraph\u00a01 of that Article\u00a011/6 provides:\n\u2018When an intermediary is bound by legal professional privilege, he or she is required:\n1\u00b0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to notify any other intermediary or intermediaries in writing, giving reasons, that he or she is unable to comply with the reporting obligation, as a result of which that reporting obligation automatically rests with the other intermediary or intermediaries;\n2\u00b0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the absence of any other intermediary, to notify the relevant taxpayer or taxpayers of their reporting obligation, in writing, giving reasons.\nThe waiver from the reporting obligation shall take effect only when an intermediary has fulfilled the obligation referred to in paragraph\u00a01.\u2019\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a011/7 of the Decree of 21\u00a0June 2013, as inserted into that decree by Article\u00a015 of the Decree of 26\u00a0June 2020, states:\n\u2018\u2026 if the intermediary notifies the relevant taxpayer or another intermediary of the application of a waiver under Article\u00a011/6(1), the obligation to file information on a reportable cross-border arrangement shall be incumbent on the other intermediary who has been notified, or if there is no such intermediary, the relevant taxpayer.\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By applications of 31\u00a0August and 1\u00a0October 2020, the applicants in the main proceedings brought an action before the Grondwettelijk Hof (Constitutional Court, Belgium), which is the referring court, seeking suspension of the Decree of 26\u00a0June 2020 and its annulment in whole or in part.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the order for reference that the applicants in the main proceedings dispute, in particular, the obligation provided for in the first subparagraph of Article\u00a011/6(1) of the Decree of 21\u00a0June 2013, which was inserted into that decree by Article\u00a014 of the Decree of 26\u00a0June 2020, which requires a lawyer acting as an intermediary, where he or she is bound by legal professional privilege, to inform the other intermediaries concerned in writing, stating reasons, that he or she cannot fulfil his or her reporting obligation. According to the applicants in the main proceedings, it is impossible to fulfil that obligation to provide information without infringing the legal professional privilege by which lawyers are bound. Furthermore, that obligation to provide information is not necessary in order to ensure that cross-border arrangements are reported, since the client, whether or not assisted by the lawyer, can him- or herself inform the other intermediaries and ask them to comply with their reporting obligation.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court notes that the information which lawyers must file with the competent authority with regard to their clients is protected by legal professional privilege, if that information relates to activities which fall within their specific tasks of defence or representation in legal proceedings and legal advice. It observes that the mere fact of having recourse to a lawyer is covered by legal professional privilege and that the same applies, a fortiori, as regards the identity of a lawyer\u2019s client. Information protected by legal professional privilege vis-\u00e0-vis public authorities is also protected with regard to other actors, such as other intermediaries.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states that, according to the \ntravaux pr\u00e9paratoires\n for the Decree of 26\u00a0June 2020, the obligation for an intermediary to inform other intermediaries, giving reasons, that he or she is subject to legal professional privilege and that he or she will not therefore fulfil the reporting obligation is required in order to satisfy the requirements of Directive 2018/822 and to ensure that legal professional privilege does not prevent the necessary reporting.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That court notes that the actions in the main proceedings thus raise the question of the validity of Directive 2018/822, in so far as it has introduced such an obligation. Therefore, before a final ruling can be given on those actions, it is first necessary to resolve that question.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Grondwettelijk Hof (Constitutional Court), first, ordered the suspension, inter alia, of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a011/6(1) of the Decree of 21\u00a0June 2013, as inserted by Article\u00a014 of the Decree of 26\u00a0June 2020, in so far as that provision imposes on a lawyer acting as an intermediary an obligation to provide information to another intermediary who is not his or her client, until the date of publication of the judgment ruling on those actions. Second, that court decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018Does Article\u00a01(2) of [Directive 2018/822] infringe the right to a fair trial as guaranteed by Article\u00a047 of the [Charter] and the right to respect for private life as guaranteed by Article\u00a07 of the [Charter], in that the new Article\u00a08ab(5) which it inserted in [Directive 2011/16], provides that, where a Member State takes the necessary measures to give intermediaries the right to waiver from filing information on a reportable cross-border arrangement where the reporting obligation would breach the legal professional privilege under the national law of that Member State, that Member State is obliged to require the intermediaries to notify, without delay, any other intermediary or, if there is no such intermediary, the relevant taxpayer, of their reporting obligations, in so far as the effect of that obligation is to oblige a lawyer acting as an intermediary to share with another intermediary, not being his [or her] client, information which he [or she] obtains in the course of the essential activities of his [or her] profession, namely, representing or defending clients in legal proceedings and giving legal advice, even in the absence of pending legal proceedings?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the question referred\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, although the question put refers to the obligation to notify, laid down in Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16, both with regard to intermediaries and, in the absence of any intermediary, to the relevant taxpayer, it is nevertheless apparent from reading the request for a preliminary ruling as a whole that the referring court is in fact seeking to ascertain only the validity of that obligation in so far as the notification must be made, by a lawyer acting as an intermediary (\u2018the lawyer-intermediary\u2019), within the meaning of Article\u00a03(21) of that directive, to another intermediary who is not his or her client.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the notification provided for in Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16 is made by the lawyer-intermediary to his or her client, whether that client is another intermediary or the relevant taxpayer, that notification is not capable of calling into question respect for the rights and freedoms guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 47 of the Charter on account, first, of the absence of any obligation of legal professional privilege on the part of the lawyer-intermediary vis-\u00e0-vis his or her client and, second, of the fact that, at the stage of the execution by that client of his or her reporting obligations under that directive, the confidentiality of the relationship between the lawyer-intermediary and that client precludes the latter from being required to reveal to third parties and, in particular, to the tax authorities, that he or she has consulted a lawyer.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is thus apparent from the order for reference that, by its question, the referring court asks the Court, in essence, to examine the validity, in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 47 of the Charter, of Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16, in so far as the Member States\u2019 application of that provision has the effect of requiring a lawyer acting as an intermediary, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(21) of that directive, where he or she is exempt from the reporting obligation laid down in paragraph\u00a01 of Article\u00a08ab of that directive on account of the legal professional privilege by which he or she is bound, to notify without delay any other intermediary who is not his or her client of that intermediary\u2019s reporting obligations under paragraph\u00a06 of that Article\u00a08ab.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article\u00a08ab(1) of amended Directive 2011/16, each Member State is to take the necessary measures to require intermediaries to file information that is within their knowledge, possession or control on reportable cross-border arrangements with the competent authorities within 30\u00a0days. The reporting obligation laid down in that provision applies to all reportable cross-border arrangements and, therefore, both to bespoke arrangements, defined in Article\u00a03(25) of amended Directive 2011/16, and marketable arrangements, defined in Article\u00a03(24) thereof.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that lawyers may, in the performance of their activities, be \u2018intermediaries\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a03(21) of amended Directive 2011/16, by reason of the fact that they may themselves perform activities relating to designing, marketing, organising, making available for implementation or managing the implementation of reportable cross-border arrangements or, failing that, because they may provide aid, assistance or advice in relation to such activities. Lawyers carrying out such activities are thus, in principle, subject to the reporting obligation laid down in Article\u00a08ab(1) of that directive.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, under the first subparagraph of Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16, each Member State may take the necessary measures to give intermediaries, and in particular lawyer-intermediaries, a waiver from filing information on a reportable cross-border arrangement where the reporting obligation would breach the legal professional privilege under the law of that Member State. In such circumstances, each Member State is to take the necessary measures to require intermediaries to notify, without delay, any other intermediary or, if there is no such intermediary, the relevant taxpayer of their reporting obligations under paragraph\u00a06 of that article. That paragraph provides that, in such a case, the reporting obligation lies with the other notified intermediary or, if there is no such intermediary, with the relevant taxpayer.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must nevertheless be pointed out that, under the second subparagraph of Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16, intermediaries may only be entitled to a waiver under the first subparagraph thereof to the extent that they operate within the limits of the relevant national laws that define their profession, which it is, where relevant, for the national court to ascertain when applying that legislation. Therefore, it is only in relation to lawyer-intermediaries who actually operate within such limits that the validity of Article\u00a08ab(5) of that directive must be examined in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 47 of the Charter.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that Article\u00a07 of the Charter, which recognises that everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications, corresponds to Article\u00a08(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950 (\u2018the ECHR\u2019), while Article\u00a047, which guarantees the right to an effective remedy and the right to a fair trial, corresponds to Article\u00a06(1) ECHR.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a052(3) of the Charter, which is intended to ensure the necessary consistency between the rights contained in the Charter and the corresponding rights guaranteed in the ECHR, without adversely affecting the autonomy of EU law, the Court must therefore take into account, when interpreting the rights guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 47 of the Charter, the corresponding rights guaranteed by Article\u00a08(1) and Article\u00a06(1) ECHR, as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights (\u2018the ECtHR\u2019), as the minimum threshold of protection (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0February 2021, \nConsob\n, C-481/19, EU:C:2021:84, paragraphs\u00a036 and 37).\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the validity of Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16 in the light of Article\u00a07 of the Charter, it is apparent from the case-law of the ECtHR that Article\u00a08(1) ECHR protects the confidentiality of all correspondence between individuals and affords strengthened protection to exchanges between lawyers and their clients (see, to that effect, ECtHR, judgment of 6\u00a0December 2012, \nMichaud v. France\n, CE:ECHR:2012:1206JUD001232311, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0117 and 118). Like that provision, the protection of which covers not only the activity of defence but also legal advice, Article\u00a07 of the Charter necessarily guarantees the secrecy of that legal consultation, both with regard to its content and to its existence. As the ECtHR has pointed out, individuals who consult a lawyer can reasonably expect that their communication is private and confidential (ECtHR, judgment of 9\u00a0April 2019, \nAltay v. Turkey \n(No\u00a02)\n, CE:ECHR:2019:0409JUD001123609, \u00a7\u00a049). Therefore, other than in exceptional situations, those persons must have a legitimate expectation that their lawyer will not disclose to anyone, without their consent, that they are consulting him or her.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The specific protection which Article\u00a07 of the Charter and Article\u00a08(1) ECHR afford to lawyers\u2019 legal professional privilege, which primarily takes the form of obligations on them, is justified by the fact that lawyers are assigned a fundamental role in a democratic society, that of defending litigants (ECtHR, judgment of 6\u00a0December 2012, \nMichaud v. France\n, CE:ECHR:2012:1206JUD001232311, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0118 and 119). That fundamental task entails, on the one hand, the requirement, the importance of which is recognised in all the Member States, that any person must be able, without constraint, to consult a lawyer whose profession encompasses, by its very nature, the giving of independent legal advice to all those in need of it and, on the other, the correlative duty of the lawyer to act in good faith towards his or her client (see, to that effect, judgment of 18\u00a0May 1982, \nAM & S Europe \nv\n Commission\n, 155/79, EU:C:1982:157, paragraph\u00a018).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The obligation laid down by Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16 for a lawyer-intermediary where he or she is, on account of the legal professional privilege by which he or she is bound by national law, exempt from the reporting obligation laid down in Article\u00a08ab(1) to notify without delay other intermediaries who are not his or her clients of their reporting obligations under Article\u00a08ab(6) of that directive, necessarily entails the consequence that those other intermediaries become aware of the identity of the notifying lawyer-intermediary, of his or her assessment that the arrangement at issue is reportable and of his or her having been consulted in connection with the arrangement.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances and in so far as those other intermediaries do not necessarily have knowledge of the identity of the lawyer-intermediary and of his or her having been consulted on the reportable cross-border arrangement, the obligation to notify, laid down in Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16, entails an interference with the right to respect for communications between lawyers and their clients, guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the Charter.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it must be observed that that obligation to notify leads, indirectly, to another interference with that right, resulting from the disclosure, by the third-party intermediaries thus notified, to the tax authorities of the identity of the lawyer-intermediary and of his or her having been consulted.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from Article\u00a08ab(1), (9), (13) and (14) of amended Directive 2011/16 that the identification of the intermediaries is one of the items of information to be provided pursuant to the reporting obligation, that identification being the subject of an exchange of information between the competent authorities of the Member States. Consequently, in the event of notification under Article\u00a08ab(5) of that directive, the third-party intermediaries notified, who are thus informed of the identity of the lawyer-intermediary and of his or her having been consulted in connection with the reportable cross-border arrangement and who are not themselves bound by legal professional privilege, must inform the competent authorities referred to in Article\u00a03(1) of that directive not only of the existence of that arrangement and of the identity of the relevant taxpayer or taxpayers, but also of the identity of the lawyer-intermediary and of his or her having been consulted.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it is necessary to examine whether those interferences with the right to respect for communications between lawyers and their clients, guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, may be justified.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it must be recalled that the rights enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society. Indeed, as can be seen from Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, that provision allows limitations to be placed on the exercise of those rights, provided that those limitations are provided for by law, that they respect the essence of those rights and that, in compliance with the principle of proportionality, they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nPrivacy International\n, C-623/17, EU:C:2020:790, paragraphs\u00a063 and 64). \n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, as regards the requirement that any limitation on the exercise of fundamental rights must be provided for by law, this implies that the act which permits the interference with those rights must itself define the scope of the limitation on the exercise of the right concerned, bearing in mind, on the one hand, that that requirement does not preclude the limitation in question from being formulated in terms which are sufficiently open to be able to adapt to different scenarios and keep pace with changing circumstances. On the other hand, the Court may, where appropriate, specify, by means of interpretation, the actual scope of the limitation in the light of the very wording of the EU legislation in question as well as its general scheme and the objectives it pursues, as interpreted in view of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter (judgment of 21\u00a0June 2022, \nLigue des droits humains\n, C-817/19, EU:C:2022:491, paragraph\u00a0114 and the case-law cited).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, first, paragraph\u00a05 of Article\u00a08ab of amended Directive 2011/16 expressly lays down the obligation, for a lawyer-intermediary who is exempt from the obligation to file information on account of the legal professional privilege by which he or she is bound, to notify other intermediaries of their reporting obligations under paragraph\u00a06 of that Article\u00a08ab. Second, as has been found in paragraphs\u00a029 and 30 of the present judgment, the interference with the right to respect for communications between lawyers and their clients, enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, is the direct consequence of such notification by the lawyer to another intermediary who is not his or her client, in particular where that client was not aware, up to the time of that notification, of the identity of that lawyer and of the latter\u2019s having been consulted on the reportable cross-border arrangement.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as regards the interference resulting indirectly from that obligation to notify on account of the disclosure, by the notified third-party intermediaries, of the identity of the lawyer-intermediary and of his or her having been consulted to the tax authorities, that disclosure is due, as has been found in paragraphs\u00a031 and 32 of the present judgment, to the extent of the obligations to provide information flowing from Article\u00a08ab(1), (9), (13) and (14) of amended Directive 2011/16.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the principle of legality must be considered to have been fulfilled.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards respect for the essence of the right to respect for communications between lawyers and their clients, guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, it should be noted that the obligation to notify, established by Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16, entails only to a limited extent the lifting, vis-\u00e0-vis a third-party intermediary and the tax authorities, of the confidentiality of the communications between the lawyer-intermediary and his or her client. In particular, that provision does not provide for an obligation, or even authorisation, for the lawyer-intermediary to share, without his or her client\u2019s consent, information on the content of those communications with other intermediaries and those intermediaries will therefore not be in a position to file such information with the tax authorities.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it cannot be held that the obligation to notify laid down in Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16 undermines the essence of the right to respect for communications between lawyers and their clients enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, as regards observance of the principle of proportionality, that principle requires that the limitations which may, in particular, be imposed by acts of EU law on rights and freedoms enshrined in the Charter do not exceed the limits of what is appropriate and necessary in order to meet the legitimate objectives pursued or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others; where there is a choice between several appropriate measures, recourse must be had to the least onerous. In addition, an objective of general interest may not be pursued without having regard to the fact that it must be reconciled with the fundamental rights affected by the measure, by properly balancing the objective of general interest against the rights at issue, in order to ensure that the disadvantages caused by that measure are not disproportionate to the aims pursued. Thus, the possibility of Member States justifying a limitation of the rights guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the Charter must be assessed by measuring the seriousness of the interference which such a limitation entails and by verifying that the importance of the objective of general interest pursued by that limitation is proportionate to that seriousness (judgments of 26\u00a0April 2022, \nPoland \nv\n Parliament and Council\n, C-401/19, EU:C:2022:297, paragraph\u00a065, and of 22\u00a0November 2022, \nLuxembourg Business Registers and Sovim\n, C-37/20 and C-601/20, EU:C:2022:912, paragraph\u00a064).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it is necessary to ascertain, first of all, whether the reporting obligation laid down in Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16 meets an objective of general interest recognised by the European Union. If so, it must then be ensured, first, that the obligation is appropriate for attaining that objective, secondly, that the interference with the fundamental right to respect for communications between lawyers and their clients which may result from that obligation to notify is limited to what is strictly necessary, in the sense that the objective pursued could not reasonably be achieved in an equally effective manner by other means less prejudicial to that right, and, thirdly, provided that that is indeed the case, that that interference is not disproportionate to that objective, which implies, in particular, a balancing of the importance of the objective and the seriousness of the interference (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0November 2022, \nLuxembourg Business Registers and Sovim\n, C-37/20 and C-601/20, EU:C:2022:912, paragraph\u00a066).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a088 of his Opinion, the amendment made to Directive 2011/16 by Directive 2018/822 falls within the scope of international tax cooperation to combat aggressive tax planning, manifested by the exchange of information between Member States. In that regard, it is apparent in particular from recitals\u00a02, 4, 8 and 9 of Directive 2018/822 that the reporting and notification obligations established by Article\u00a08ab of amended Directive 2011/16 are intended to contribute to the prevention of the risk of tax avoidance and evasion.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Combating aggressive tax planning and preventing the risk of tax avoidance and evasion constitute objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union for the purposes of Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, capable of enabling a limitation to be placed on the exercise of the rights guaranteed by Article\u00a07 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \n\u00c9tat luxembourgeois (Right to bring an action against a request for information in tax matters)\n, C-245/19 and C-246/19, EU:C:2020:795, paragraph\u00a087).\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the question whether the obligation to notify laid down in Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16 is appropriate and necessary for the attainment of those objectives, the French and Latvian Governments maintain, in essence, that such notification makes it possible, inter alia, to raise awareness among other intermediaries of their duty to comply with the reporting obligation and thus to avoid the possibility that those other intermediaries are not informed of the fact that the obligation to report the cross-border arrangement has been transferred to them pursuant to Article\u00a08ab(6) of amended Directive 2011/16. Therefore, according to those governments, in the absence of an obligation on the lawyer-intermediary to notify, there is a risk that the cross-border arrangement will not be declared at all, contrary to the objectives pursued by that directive.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if the notification obligation established by Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16 is indeed capable of contributing to the combating of aggressive tax planning and the prevention of the risk of tax avoidance and evasion, it must be held that that obligation cannot, however, be regarded as being strictly necessary in order to attain those objectives and, in particular, to ensure that the information concerning the reportable cross-border arrangements is filed with the competent authorities.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, intermediaries\u2019 reporting obligations are clearly set out in amended Directive 2011/16, in particular in Article\u00a08ab(1) thereof. Under that provision, all intermediaries are, in principle, required to file information that is within their knowledge, possession or control on reportable cross-border arrangements with the competent authorities. In addition, in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article\u00a08ab(9) of that directive, each Member State is to take the necessary measures to require that, where there is more than one intermediary, the obligation to file information lie with all intermediaries involved in the same reportable cross-border arrangement. No intermediary can therefore usefully argue that he or she was unaware of the reporting obligations to which he or she is directly and individually subject, merely because he or she is an intermediary.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, as regards the Latvian Government\u2019s argument that the obligation to notify reduces the risk that other intermediaries would rely on the fact that the lawyer-intermediary will report the required information to the competent authorities and that they will refrain for that reason from themselves making such a report, it should be noted, on the one hand, that, in so far as the consultation of a lawyer is subject to legal professional privilege, other intermediaries will not, as has been pointed out in paragraph\u00a030 of the present judgment, necessarily be aware of the identity of the lawyer-intermediary and of his or her having been consulted concerning the reportable cross-border arrangement, which in such circumstances precludes such a risk from the outset.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, even in the opposite situation in which other intermediaries have such awareness, there is no reason to fear that they would rely, without verification, on the lawyer-intermediary making the required report, since the second subparagraph of Article\u00a08ab(9) of amended Directive 2011/16 specifies that an intermediary is to be exempt from filing the information only on condition that it has proof that the same information has already been filed by another intermediary. Furthermore, by expressly providing, in Article\u00a08ab(5) thereof, that legal professional privilege may lead to a waiver from the reporting obligation, amended Directive 2011/16 makes a lawyer-intermediary a person from whom other intermediaries cannot, a priori, expect any initiative capable of relieving them of their own reporting obligations.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirdly, it should be borne in mind that any intermediary who, because of the legal professional privilege by which he or she is bound by national law, is exempt from the reporting obligation laid down in paragraph\u00a01 of Article\u00a08ab of amended Directive 2011/16 is nevertheless still required to notify without delay his or her client of his or her reporting obligations under paragraph\u00a06 of that provision.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourthly, as regards the disclosure, by notified third-party intermediaries, of the identity of the lawyer-intermediary and of his or her having been consulted to the tax authorities, that disclosure also does not appear to be strictly necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of amended Directive 2011/16 of combating aggressive tax planning and preventing the risk of tax avoidance and evasion.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the one hand, the reporting obligation on other intermediaries not subject to legal professional privilege and, if there are no such intermediaries, that obligation on the relevant taxpayer ensure, in principle, that the tax authorities are informed of reportable cross-border arrangements. In addition, the tax authorities may, after receiving such information, request, if necessary, additional information relating to the arrangement in question directly from the relevant taxpayer, who will then be able to consult his or her lawyer for assistance, or they may conduct an audit of that taxpayer\u2019s tax situation.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, in view of the reporting waiver in Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16, the disclosure to the tax authorities of the identity of the lawyer-intermediary and of his or her having been consulted will not, in any event, enable those authorities to require that lawyer-intermediary to provide information without the consent of his or her client.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the hearing before the Court, the Commission submitted, however, in essence, that the disclosure of the identity of the lawyer-intermediary and of his or her having been consulted would be necessary in order to enable the tax authorities to ascertain whether that lawyer-intermediary is justified in relying on legal professional privilege.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That argument cannot be accepted.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, as has been pointed out in paragraph\u00a024 of the present judgment, the second subparagraph of paragraph\u00a05 of Article\u00a08ab of amended Directive 2011/16 specifies that lawyer-intermediaries may only be entitled to a waiver under the first subparagraph of that provision to the extent that they operate within the limits of the relevant national laws that define their profession. However, the purpose of the reporting and notification obligations laid down in Article\u00a08ab of that directive is not to check that lawyer-intermediaries operate within those limits, but to combat potentially aggressive tax practices and to prevent the risk of tax avoidance and evasion, by ensuring that the information concerning the reportable cross-border arrangements is filed with the competent authorities.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from paragraphs\u00a047 to 53 of the present judgment, that directive ensures that such information is provided to the tax authorities, without the disclosure to them of the identity of the lawyer-intermediary and of his or her having been consulted being necessary for that purpose.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the possibility that lawyer-intermediaries might wrongly rely on legal professional privilege in order to avoid their reporting obligation cannot permit the inference that the obligation to notify laid down in Article\u00a08ab(5) of that directive and the disclosure to the tax authorities of the identity and consultation of the notifying lawyer-intermediary which is the consequence thereof are strictly necessary.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing considerations that Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16 infringes the right to respect for communications between a lawyer and his or her client, guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, in so far as it provides, in essence, that a lawyer-intermediary, who is subject to legal professional privilege, is required to notify any other intermediary who is not his or her client of that other intermediary\u2019s reporting obligations.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the validity of Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16 in the light of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, it must be recalled that the right to a fair trial, guaranteed by that provision, consists of various elements. It includes, inter alia, the rights of the defence, the principle of equality of arms, the right of access to the courts and the right of access to a lawyer, both in civil and criminal proceedings. Lawyers would be unable to carry out satisfactorily their task of advising, defending and representing their clients, who would in consequence be deprived of the rights conferred on them by Article\u00a047 of the Charter, if lawyers were obliged, in the context of judicial proceedings or the preparation for such proceedings, to cooperate with the authorities by passing them information obtained in the course of related legal consultations (see, to that effect, judgment of 26\u00a0June 2007, \nOrdre des barreaux francophones et germanophones and Others\n, C-305/05, EU:C:2007:383, paragraphs\u00a031 and 32).\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from those considerations that the requirements implied by the right to a fair trial presuppose, by definition, a link with judicial proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 26\u00a0June 2007, \nOrdre des barreaux francophones et germanophones and Others\n, C-305/05, EU:C:2007:383, paragraph\u00a035).\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it must be stated that such a link has not been established in the present case.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from Article\u00a08ab(1) and (5) of amended Directive 2011/16, and in particular from the time limits laid down in those provisions, that the obligation to notify arises at an early stage, at the latest when the reportable cross-border arrangement has just been finalised and is ready to be implemented, and thus outside the framework of legal proceedings or their preparation.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point\u00a041 of his Opinion, at that early stage, the lawyer-intermediary is not acting as the defence counsel for his or her client in a dispute and the mere fact that the lawyer\u2019s advice or the cross-border arrangement which is the subject of his or her consultation may give rise to litigation at a later stage does not mean that the lawyer acted for the purposes and in the interests of the rights of defence of his or her client.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, it must be held that the obligation to notify replacing, for the lawyer-intermediary bound by legal professional privilege, the reporting obligation laid down in Article\u00a08ab(1) of amended Directive 2011/16 does not entail any interference with the right to a fair trial, guaranteed in Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the answer to the question referred is that Article\u00a08ab(5) of amended Directive 2011/16 is invalid in the light of Article\u00a07 of the Charter, in so far as the Member States\u2019 application of that provision has the effect of requiring a lawyer acting as an intermediary, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(21) of that directive, where he or she is exempt from the reporting obligation laid down in paragraph\u00a01 of Article\u00a08ab of that directive on account of the legal professional privilege by which he or she is bound, to notify without delay any other intermediary who is not his or her client of that intermediary\u2019s reporting obligations under paragraph\u00a06 of that Article\u00a08ab.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a08ab(5) of Council Directive 2011/16/EU of 15\u00a0February 2011 on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and repealing Directive 77/799/EEC, as amended by Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25\u00a0May 2018, is invalid in the light of Article\u00a07 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in so far as the Member States\u2019 application of that provision has the effect of requiring a lawyer acting as an intermediary, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(21) of that directive, as amended, where he or she is exempt from the reporting obligation laid down in paragraph\u00a01 of Article\u00a08ab of that directive, as amended, on account of the legal professional privilege by which he or she is bound, to notify without delay any other intermediary who is not his or her client of that intermediary\u2019s reporting obligations under paragraph\u00a06 of that Article\u00a08ab."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by

Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits

Section 1(1) of that Act defines the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 as follows:\n\u2018Data relating to a living individual who is or can be identified either from the data or from data in conjunction with other information that is in, or is likely to come into, the possession of the Data Controller\u2019.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right of access is governed by Section 4 of the data protection legislation; Section 4(6), which relates specifically to requests for access to the results of examinations, is worded as follows:\n\u2018(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A request by an individual under subsection (1) of this section in relation to the results of an examination at which he was a candidate shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to be made on \n(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the date of the first publication of the results of the examination, or \nii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the date of the request, \nwhichever is the later; ...\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this subsection \u201cexamination\u201d means any process for determining the knowledge, intelligence, skill or ability of a person by reference to his performance in any test, work or other activity.\u2019\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06 of the data protection legislation establishes the right to rectification and erasure of personal data the processing of which does not comply with that legislation. \n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a010(1)(b)(i) of the data protection legislation requires the Data Protection Commissioner to investigate a complaint \u2018unless he is of the opinion that it is frivolous or vexatious\u2019.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Nowak was a trainee accountant who passed first level accountancy examinations and three second level examinations set by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ireland (\u2018the CAI\u2019). However, Mr\u00a0Nowak failed the Strategic Finance and Management Accounting examination, which allowed candidates to make use of documents (an open book examination). \n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After he had failed that examination for the fourth time, in the autumn of 2009, Mr\u00a0Nowak initially submitted a challenge to the result of that examination. After that challenge was rejected in March 2010, he submitted, in May 2010, a data access request, under Section 4 of the data protection legislation, seeking all the personal data relating to him held by the CAI.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 1\u00a0June 2010, the CAI sent 17 documents to Mr\u00a0Nowak, but refused to send to him his examination script, on the ground that it did not contain personal data, within the meaning of the data protection legislation.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Nowak then contacted the Data Protection Commissioner with a view to challenging the reason given for the refusal to disclose his examination script. In June 2010 the Data Protection Commissioner replied to him by email to state, inter alia, that \u2018exam scripts do not generally fall to be considered [for data protection purposes] \u2026 because this material would not generally constitute personal data\u2019.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That reply from the Data Protection Commissioner was followed by correspondence between Mr\u00a0Nowak and the Commissioner which culminated, on 1\u00a0July 2010, in Mr\u00a0Nowak submitting a formal complaint. \n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 21\u00a0July 2010, the Data Protection Commissioner informed Mr\u00a0Nowak that, after consideration of the case, he had identified no substantive contravention of [the data protection legislation] and that, in accordance with Section 10(1)(b)(i) of that legislation, which covers frivolous or vexatious complaints, there would be no investigation of the complaint. The letter stated, further, that the material over which Mr\u00a0Nowak sought to exercise \u2018a right of correction is not personal data to which Section 6 of the [data protection legislation] applies\u2019.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Nowak brought an action against that decision before the Circuit Court. That court held that the action was inadmissible on the ground that, since the Data Protection Commissioner had not initiated an investigation of a complaint, there was no decision against which legal proceedings could be brought. In the alternative, that court held that the action was unfounded, since the examination script did not constitute personal data.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Nowak brought an appeal against the judgment of that court before the High Court, which however upheld the decision. The judgment of the High Court was, in its turn, upheld by the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court, which allowed an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, held that the action brought by Mr\u00a0Nowak against the decision of the Data Protection Commissioner was admissible.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the Supreme Court is uncertain whether an examination script can constitute personal data, within the meaning of Directive 95/46, and therefore decided to stay the proceedings and to refer to the Court the following questions for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is information recorded in/as answers given by a candidate during a professional examination capable of being personal data, within the meaning of Directive 95/46?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the answer to Question 1 is that all or some of such information may be personal data within the meaning of the Directive, what factors are relevant in determining whether in any given case such script is personal data, and what weight should be given to such factors?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its questions, which can be examined together, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, the written answers submitted by a candidate at a professional examination and any examiner\u2019s comments with respect to those answers constitute personal data, within the meaning of that provision.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be recalled that Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 defines personal data as meaning \u2018any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019. Under the same provision, \u2018an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity\u2019.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not disputed that a candidate at a professional examination is a natural person who can be identified, either directly, through his name, or indirectly, through an identification number, these being placed either on the examination script itself or on its cover sheet. \n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contrary to what the Data Protection Commissioner appears to argue, it is of no relevance, in that context, whether the examiner can or cannot identify the candidate at the time when he/she is correcting and marking the examination script. \n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For information to be treated as \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46, there is no requirement that all the information enabling the identification of the data subject must be in the hands of one person (judgment of 19\u00a0October 2016, \nBreyer\n, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph\u00a043). It is also undisputed that, in the event that the examiner does not know the identity of the candidate when he/she is marking the answers submitted by that candidate in an examination, the body that set the examination, in this case the CAI, does, however, have available to it the information needed to enable it easily and infallibly to identify that candidate through his identification number, placed on the examination script or its cover sheet, and thereby to ascribe the answers to that candidate. \n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is however necessary to determine whether the written answers provided by a candidate at a professional examination and any comments made by an examiner with respect to those answers constitute information relating to that candidate, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46. \n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has held previously, the scope of Directive 95/46 is very wide and the personal data covered by that directive is varied (judgment of 7\u00a0May 2009, \nRijkeboer\n, C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293, paragraph\u00a059 and the case-law cited).\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use of the expression \u2018any information\u2019 in the definition of the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019, within Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46, reflects the aim of the EU legislature to assign a wide scope to that concept, which is not restricted to information that is sensitive or private, but potentially encompasses all kinds of information, not only objective but also subjective, in the form of opinions and assessments, provided that it \u2018relates\u2019 to the data subject. \n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the latter condition, it is satisfied where the information, by reason of its content, purpose or effect, is linked to a particular person.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is argued, in essence, by Mr\u00a0Nowak, the Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Austrian and Portuguese governments and also by the European Commission, the written answers submitted by a candidate at a professional examination constitute information that is linked to him or her as a person.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the content of those answers reflects the extent of the candidate\u2019s knowledge and competence in a given field and, in some cases, his intellect, thought processes, and judgment. In the case of a handwritten script, the answers contain, in addition, information as to his handwriting. \n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the purpose of collecting those answers is to evaluate the candidate\u2019s professional abilities and his suitability to practice the profession concerned. \n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last, the use of that information, one consequence of that use being the candidate\u2019s success or failure at the examination concerned, is liable to have an effect on his or her rights and interests, in that it may determine or influence, for example, the chance of entering the profession aspired to or of obtaining the post sought.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is, moreover, equally true that the written answers submitted by a candidate at a professional examination constitute information that relates to that candidate by reason of its content, purpose or effect, where the examination is, as in this case, an open book examination. \n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is stated by the Advocate General in point\u00a024 of her Opinion, the aim of any examination is to determine and establish the individual performance of a specific person, namely the candidate, and not, unlike, for example, a representative survey, to obtain information that is independent of that person. \n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the comments of an examiner with respect to the candidate\u2019s answers, it is clear that they, no less than the answers submitted by the candidate at the examination, constitute information relating to that candidate. \n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The content of those comments reflects the opinion or the assessment of the examiner of the individual performance of the candidate in the examination, particularly of his or her knowledge and competences in the field concerned. The purpose of those comments is, moreover, precisely to record the evaluation by the examiner of the candidate\u2019s performance, and those comments are liable to have effects for the candidate, as stated in paragraph\u00a039 of this judgment. \n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The finding that the comments of the examiner with respect to the answers submitted by the candidate at the examination constitute information which, by reason of its content, purpose or effect, is linked to that candidate is not called into question by the fact that those comments also constitute information relating to the examiner. \n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same information may relate to a number of individuals and may constitute for each of them, provided that those persons are identified or identifiable, personal data, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46. \n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, the question whether written answers submitted by a candidate at a professional examination and any comments made by the examiner with respect to those answers should be classified as personal data cannot be affected, contrary to what is argued by the Data Protection Commissioner and the Irish government, by the fact that the consequence of that classification is, in principle, that the candidate has rights of access and rectification, pursuant to Article\u00a012(a) and (b) of Directive 95/46.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must, first, be recalled, as argued by the Commission at the hearing, that a number of principles and safeguards, provided for by Directive 95/46, are attached to that classification and follow from that classification. \n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is stated in recital 25 of Directive 95/46 that the principles of protection provided for by that directive are reflected, on the one hand, in the obligations imposed on those responsible for processing data, obligations which concern in particular data quality, technical security, notification to the supervisory authority, and the circumstances under which processing can be carried out, and, on the other hand, in the rights conferred on individuals, the data on whom are the subject of processing, to be informed that processing is taking place, to consult the data, to request corrections and even to object to processing in certain circumstances. \n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, if information relating to a candidate, contained in his or her answers submitted at a professional examination and in the comments made by the examiner with respect to those answers, were not to be classified as \u2018personal data\u2019, that would have the effect of entirely excluding that information from the obligation to comply not only with the principles and safeguards that must be observed in the area of personal data protection, and, in particular, the principles relating to the quality of such data and the criteria for making data processing legitimate, established in Articles\u00a06 and 7 of Directive 95/46, but also with the rights of access, rectification and objection of the data subject, provided for in Articles\u00a012 and 14 of that directive, and with the supervision exercised by the supervisory authority under Article\u00a028 of that directive. \n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As stated by the Advocate General in point\u00a026 of her Opinion, it is undisputed that an examination candidate has, inter alia, a legitimate interest, based on the protection of his private life, in being able to object to the processing of the answers submitted by him at that examination and of the examiner\u2019s comments with respect to those answers outside the examination procedure and, in particular, to their being sent to third parties, or published, without his permission. Equally, the body setting the examination, as the data controller, is obliged to ensure that those answers and comments are stored in such a way as to ensure that third parties do not have unlawful access to them. \n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, it is clear that the rights of access and rectification, provided for in Article\u00a012(a) and (b) of Directive 95/46, may also be asserted in relation to the written answers submitted by a candidate at a professional examination and to any comments made by an examiner with respect to those answers.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, the right of rectification provided for in Article\u00a012(b) of Directive 95/46 cannot enable a candidate to \u2018correct\u2019, \na posteriori\n, answers that are \u2018incorrect\u2019. \n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from Article\u00a06(1)(d) of Directive 95/46 that the assessment of whether personal data is accurate and complete must be made in the light of the purpose for which that data was collected. That purpose consists, as far as the answers submitted by an examination candidate are concerned, in being able to evaluate the level of knowledge and competence of that candidate at the time of the examination. That level is revealed precisely by any errors in those answers. Consequently, such errors do not represent inaccuracy, within the meaning of Directive 95/46, which would give rise to a right of rectification under Article\u00a012(b) of that directive.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, it is possible that there might be situations where the answers of an examination candidate and the examiner\u2019s comments with respect to those answers prove to be inaccurate, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(d) of Directive 95/46, for example due to the fact that, by mistake, the examination scripts were mixed up in such a way that the answers of another candidate were ascribed to the candidate concerned, or that some of the cover sheets containing the answers of that candidate are lost, so that those answers are incomplete, or that any comments made by an examiner do not accurately record the examiner\u2019s evaluation of the answers of the candidate concerned. \n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, as stated by the Advocate General in point\u00a037 of her Opinion, it cannot be ruled out that a candidate may, under Article\u00a012(b) of Directive 95/46, have the right to ask the data controller to ensure that his examination answers and the examiner\u2019s comments with respect to them are, after a certain period of time, erased, that is to say, destroyed. Pursuant to Article\u00a06(1)(e) of that directive, personal data is to be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is subsequently processed. Taking into consideration the purpose of the answers submitted by an examination candidate and of the examiner\u2019s comments with respect to those answers, their retention in a form permitting the identification of the candidate is, a priori, no longer necessary as soon as the examination procedure is finally closed and can no longer be challenged, so that those answers and comments have lost any probative value. \n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as the written answers submitted by a candidate at a professional examination and any comments made by an examiner with respect to those answers are therefore liable to be checked for, in particular, their accuracy and the need for their retention, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(d) and (e) of Directive 95/46, and may be subject to rectification or erasure, under Article\u00a012(b) of the directive, the Court must hold that to give a candidate a right of access to those answers and to those comments, under Article\u00a012(a) of that directive, serves the purpose of that directive of guaranteeing the protection of that candidate\u2019s right to privacy with regard to the processing of data relating to him (see, \na contrario\n, judgment of 17\u00a0July 2014, \nYS and Others\n, C-141/12 and C-372/12, EU:C:2014:2081, paragraphs\u00a045 and 46), irrespective of whether that candidate does or does not also have such a right of access under the national legislation applicable to the examination procedure.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it must be recalled that the protection of the fundamental right to respect for private life means, inter alia, that any individual may be certain that the personal data relating to him is correct and that it is processed in a lawful manner. As is apparent from recital 41 of Directive 95/46, it is in order to be in a position to carry out the necessary checks that the data subject has, under Article\u00a012(a) of the directive, a right of access to the data relating to him which is being processed. That right of access is necessary, inter alia, to enable the data subject to obtain, depending on the circumstances, the rectification, erasure or blocking of his data by the data controller and consequently to exercise the right set out in Article\u00a012(b) of that directive (judgment of 17\u00a0July 2014, \nYS and Others\n, C-141/12 and C-372/12, EU:C:2014:2081, paragraph\u00a044 and the case-law cited).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last, it must be said, first, that the rights of access and rectification, under Article\u00a012(a) and (b) of Directive 95/46, do not extend to the examination questions, which do not as such constitute the candidate\u2019s personal data.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679 which replaces the directive both provide for certain restrictions on those rights. \n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, under Article\u00a013(1)(g) of Directive 95/46, Member States may adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in, inter alia, Article\u00a06(1) and Article\u00a012 of that directive, when such a restriction constitutes a necessary measure to safeguard the rights and freedoms of others.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a023(1)(e) of Regulation 2016/679 extends the list of grounds justifying restrictions, currently laid down in Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 95/46, to \u2018other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a Member State\u2019. Further, Article\u00a015(4) of Regulation 2016/679, that article relating to the data subject\u2019s right of access, provides that the right to obtain a copy of personal data must not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the questions referred is that Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that, in circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, the written answers submitted by a candidate at a professional examination and any comments made by an examiner with respect to those answers constitute personal data, within the meaning of that provision.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as meaning that, in circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, the written answers submitted by a candidate at a professional examination and any comments made by an examiner with respect to those answers constitute personal data, within the meaning of that provision.\nIle\u0161i\u010d\nRosas\nToader\nPrechal\n\u00a0\nJara\u0161i\u016bnas\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 20 December 2017.\nA.\u00a0Calot Escobar\n\u00a0\nM.

To this end, Member States may, inter alia, adopt legislative measures providing for the retention of data for a limited period justified on the grounds laid down in this paragraph. All the measures referred to in this paragraph shall be in accordance with the general principles of Community law, including those referred to in Article\u00a06(1) and (2) of the Treaty on European Union.\u2019\n\u00a0\nBelgian law\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the fourth subparagraph of Article\u00a0XI.165(1) of the Wetboek Economisch Recht (Code of Economic Law), the author of a literary or artistic work alone has the right to communicate it to the public by any means, including by making available to the public in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 6\u00a0June 2019, Mircom brought an action before the Ondernemingsrechtbank Antwerpen (Companies Court, Antwerp, Belgium) seeking, inter alia, that Telenet be ordered to produce the identification data for its customers whose Internet connections had been used to share, on a peer-to-peer network by means of the BitTorrent protocol, films from the Mircom catalogue.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mircom claims to have thousands of dynamic IP addresses recorded on its behalf, thanks to the FileWatchBT software, by Media Protector GmbH, a company established in Germany, at the time of the connection of those Telenet customers using the Bit-Torrent client sharing software.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Telenet, supported by two other Internet access providers established in Belgium, Proximus NV and Scarlet Belgium NV, oppose Mircom\u2019s action.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, in the light of the judgment of 14\u00a0June 2017, \nStichting Brein\n (C-610/15, EU:C:2017:456), which concerned communication to the public, within the meaning of Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 2001/29, by the operators of an Internet sharing platform in the context of a peer-to-peer network, the referring court asks whether such a communication to the public may be made by individual users of such a network, called \u2018downloaders\u2019, who, by downloading pieces of a digital file containing a copyrighted work, simultaneously make those pieces available for uploading by other users. Those users, belonging to a group of persons who download, called the \u2018swarm\u2019, thus themselves become \u2018seeders\u2019 of those pieces, like the undetermined initial seeder, who is at the origin of the first provision of that file in that network.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the referring court states, first, that the pieces are not mere fragments of the original file, but autonomous encrypted files which are unusable in themselves, and, second, that, because of the way in which BitTorrent technology functions, the uploading of the pieces of a file, known as \u2018seeding\u2019, is, in principle, automatic, as that characteristic can be eliminated only by certain programs.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Mircom claims that even downloads of pieces representing together a proportion of at least 20% of the underlying media file should be taken into account, since, on the basis of that percentage, it becomes possible to obtain an overview of that file, although fragmentary and of highly uncertain quality.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, the referring court doubts whether an undertaking, such as Mircom, can enjoy the protection conferred by Directive 2004/48, in so far as it does not actually use the rights assigned by the authors of the films at issue, but merely claims damages from alleged infringers, a model which resembles the definition of a \u2018copyright troll\u2019.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, the question also arises as to the lawfulness of the manner in which the IP addresses were collected by Mircom, in the light of point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was in those circumstances that the Ondernemingsrechtbank Antwerpen (Companies Court, Antwerp) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can the downloading of a file via a peer-to-peer network and the simultaneous provision for uploading of parts thereof\u00a0\u2026 (which may be very fragmentary as compared to the whole) (\u2018seeding\u2019) be regarded as a communication to the public within the meaning of Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 2001/29, even if the individual pieces as such are unusable?\nIf so,\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0is there a \nde minimis\n threshold above which the seeding of those pieces would constitute a communication to the public?\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0is the fact that seeding can take place automatically (as a result of the BitTorrent client settings), and thus without the user\u2019s knowledge, relevant?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can a person who is the contractual holder of the copyright (or related rights), but does not himself exploit those rights and merely claims damages from alleged infringers\u00a0\u2013 and whose economic business model thus depends on the existence of piracy, not on combating it\u00a0\u2013 enjoy the same rights as those conferred by Chapter\u00a0II of Directive 2004/48 on authors or licence holders who exploit copyright in the normal way?\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How can the licence holder in that case have suffered \u201cprejudice\u201d (within the meaning of Article\u00a013 of Directive 2004/48) as a result of the infringement?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are the specific circumstances set out in Questions\u00a01 and 2 relevant when assessing the correct balance to be struck between, on the one hand, the enforcement of intellectual property rights and, on the other, the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the [Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union], such as respect for private life and protection of personal data, in particular in the context of the assessment of proportionality?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is, in all those circumstances, the systematic registration and general further processing of the IP-addresses of a \u201cswarm\u201d of \u201cseeders\u201d (by the licence holder himself or herself, and by a third party on his or her behalf) legitimate under Regulation [2016/679], and specifically under Article\u00a06(1) [first subparagraph] (f) thereof?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted as a preliminary point that, in the procedure laid down by Article\u00a0267 TFEU providing for cooperation between national courts and the Court of Justice, it is for the latter to provide the national court with an answer which will be of use to it and enable it to determine the case before it. To that end, the Court may have to reformulate the questions referred to it. The Court has a duty to interpret all provisions of EU law which national courts require in order to decide on the actions pending before them, even if those provisions are not expressly indicated in the questions referred to the Court by those courts (judgment of 19\u00a0December 2019, \nNederlands Uitgeversverbond and Groep Algemene Uitgevers\n, C-263/18, EU:C:2019:1111, paragraph\u00a031 and the case-law cited).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, the Court can extract from all the information provided by the national court, in particular from the grounds of the order for reference, the points of EU law which require interpretation in view of the subject matter of the dispute in the main proceedings (judgment of 19\u00a0December 2019, \nNederlands Uitgeversverbond and Groep Algemene Uitgevers\n, C-263/18, EU:C:2019:1111, paragraph\u00a032 and the case-law cited).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, by its first question, the referring court asks the Court, in essence, whether the concept of \u2018communication to the public\u2019, referred to in Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 2001/29, covers the sharing, on a peer-to-peer network, of sometimes very fragmentary pieces of a media file containing a protected work. However, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a034 of his Opinion, in so far as, in the main proceedings, the rights of film producers are concerned, it appears that, in the present case, it is rather Article\u00a03(2)(c) of that directive which could apply.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, since the EU legislature did not express a different intention, the expression \u2018making available to the public\u2019, used in Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 2001/29 as a form of authors\u2019 exclusive right to authorise or prohibit any \u2018communication to the public\u2019, and the identical expression in Article\u00a03(2) of that directive, designating an exclusive right belonging to the holders of related rights, must be interpreted as having the same meaning (see, by analogy, judgment of 2\u00a0April 2020, \nStim and SAMI\n, C-753/18, EU:C:2020:268, paragraph\u00a028 and the case-law cited).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of those considerations, it is necessary to reformulate the first question to the effect that, by that question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a03(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the uploading, from the terminal equipment of a user of a peer-to-peer network to such equipment of other users of that network, of pieces, previously downloaded by that user, of a media file containing a protected work, although those pieces are usable in themselves only as from a certain download rate and that, because of the configurations of the BitTorrent client sharing software, that uploading is automatically generated by that software, constitutes making available to the public, within the meaning of that provision.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, it must be noted that, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a048 of his Opinion, those pieces are not parts of works, but parts of the files containing those works, used for transmitting those files under the BitTorrent protocol. Accordingly, the fact that the pieces which are transmitted are unusable in themselves is irrelevant since what is made available is the file containing the work, that is to say the work in digital format.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a049 of his Opinion, the operation of peer-to-peer peer networks does not differ, in essence, from the operation of the Internet in general or, more specifically, from the World Wide Web, where the files containing a work are divided into small data packages, which are routed between the server and the client in a random order and by different channels.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, as is apparent from the order for reference, any user of the peer-to-peer network can easily reconstruct the original file from pieces available on the computers of users participating in the same swarm. The fact that a user does not succeed, individually, in downloading the entire original file does not prevent him or her from making available to his or her peers the pieces of that file which he or she has managed to download onto his or her computer and that he or she thus contributes to the creation of a situation in which, ultimately, all the users participating in the swarm have access to the complete file.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to establish that there is \u2018making available\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a03(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29 in such a situation, it is not necessary to prove that the user concerned has previously downloaded a number of pieces representing a minimum threshold.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order for there to be an \u2018act of communication\u2019, and consequently, an act of making available, it is sufficient, in the final analysis, that a work is made available to a public in such a way that the persons comprising that public may access it, from wherever and whenever they individually choose, irrespective of whether or not they avail themselves of that opportunity (see, to that effect, judgment of 7\u00a0August 2018, \nRenckhoff\n, C-161/17, EU:C:2018:634, paragraph\u00a020). The concept of an \u2018act of communication\u2019 refers, in that regard, to any transmission of the protected works, irrespective of the technical means or process used (judgment of 29\u00a0November 2017, \nVCAST\n, C-265/16, EU:C:2017:913; paragraph\u00a042 and the case-law cited).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, any act whereby a user, in full knowledge of the consequences of what he or she is doing, gives access to protected work is liable to constitute an act of communication for the purposes of Article\u00a03(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29 (see, to that effect, judgment of 9\u00a0March 2021, \nVG Bild-Kunst\n, C-392/19, EU:C:2021:181, paragraph\u00a030 and the case-law cited).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it appears that any user of the peer-to-peer network at issue, who has not deactivated the upload function of the BitTorrent client sharing software, uploads onto that network the pieces of media files that he or she has previously downloaded onto his or her computer. Provided that it is apparent, which it is for the referring court to determine, that the relevant users of that network have subscribed to that software by giving their consent to its application after having been duly informed of its characteristics, those users must be regarded as acting in full knowledge of their conduct and of the consequences which it may have. Once it is established that they have actively subscribed to such software, the deliberate nature of their conduct is in no way negated by the fact that the uploading is automatically generated by that software.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If it follows from the foregoing considerations that, subject to factual verification which it is for the referring court to carry out, the conduct of the users concerned is capable of constituting an act of making available a work or other protected subject matter, it is then necessary to examine whether such conduct constitutes making available to \u2018the public\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a03(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be recalled that, in order to come within the concept of \u2018making available to the public\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, works or other subject matter must in fact be made available to a public, that making available referring to an indeterminate number of potential recipients and involving a fairly large number of persons. Moreover, that making available to the public must be communicated using specific technical means, different from those previously used or, failing that, to a new public, that is to say, to a public that was not already taken into account by the rightholder of any copyright or related right when he or she authorised the initial communication of his or her work or of other protected subject matter to the public (see, to that effect, judgment of 9\u00a0March 2021, \nVG Bild-Kunst\n, C-392/19, EU:C:2021:181, paragraphs\u00a031 and 32 and the case-law cited).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards peer-to-peer networks, the Court has already held that the making available and management, on the Internet, of a sharing platform which, by means of indexation of metadata referring to protected works and the provision of a search engine, allows users of that platform to locate those works and to share them in the context of such a network constitutes a communication to the public within the meaning of Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 2001/29 (judgment of 14\u00a0June 2017, \nStichting Brein\n, C-610/15, EU:C:2017:456, paragraph\u00a048).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, as the Advocate General found, in essence, in points\u00a037 and 61 of his Opinion, the computers of those users sharing the same file constitute the peer-to-peer network itself, called the \u2018swarm\u2019, in which they play the same role as the servers in the operation of the World Wide Web.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is common ground that such a network is used by a considerable number of persons, as is apparent, moreover, from the high number of IP addresses registered by Mircom. Moreover, those users can access, at any time and simultaneously, the protected works which are shared by means of the platform.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, that making available is aimed at an indeterminate number of potential recipients and involves a fairly large number of persons.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in so far as the case concerns works published without the authorisation of the rightholders, it must also be considered that those works are made available to a new public (see, by analogy, judgment of 14\u00a0June 2017, \nStichting Brein\n, C-610/15, EU:C:2017:456, paragraph\u00a045 and the case-law cited).\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, even if it were found that a work has been previously posted on a website, without any restriction preventing it from being downloaded and with the consent of the rightholder of any copyright or related rights, the fact that, through a peer-to-peer network, users such as those at issue in the main proceedings have downloaded parts of the file containing that work on a private server, followed by those pieces being made available by means of uploading those pieces into the same network, means that those users have played a decisive role in making that work available to a public which was not taken into account by the rightholder of any copyright or related rights in that work when he or she authorised the initial communication (see, by analogy, judgment of 7\u00a0August 2018, \nRenckhoff\n, C-161/17, EU:C:2018:634, paragraphs\u00a046 and 47).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If such making available, by uploading a work, without the rightholder of the copyright or related rights over it being able to rely on the rights laid down in Article\u00a03(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29, constitutes it being made available, the consequence would be that the need to safeguard a fair balance, referred to in recitals\u00a03 and 31 of that directive, in the digital environment between, on one hand, the interest of the holders of copyright and related rights in the protection of their intellectual property, guaranteed in Article\u00a017(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights (\u2018the Charter\u2019) and, on the other hand, the protection of the interests and fundamental rights of users of protected subject matter, in particular their freedom of expression and information guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter, as well as the public interest, would be disregarded (see, to that effect, judgment of 9\u00a0March 2021, \nVG Bild-Kunst\n, C-392/19, EU:C:2021:181, paragraph\u00a054 and the case-law cited). Disregard of that balance would, moreover, undermine the principal objective of Directive 2001/29, which, as is apparent from recitals\u00a04, 9 and 10 thereof, is to establish a high level of protection for rightholders, enabling rightholders to obtain an appropriate reward for the use of their protected works or other subject matter, in particular when they are made available to the public.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a03(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the uploading, from the terminal equipment of a user of a peer-to-peer network to such equipment of other users of that network, of pieces, previously downloaded by that user, of a media file containing a protected work, even though those pieces are usable in themselves only as from a certain download rate, constitutes making available to the public within the meaning of that provision. It is irrelevant that, due to the configurations of the BitTorrent client sharing software, that uploading is automatically generated by it, when the user, from whose terminal equipment that uploading takes place, has subscribed to that software by giving his or her consent to its application after having been duly informed of its characteristics.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directive 2004/48 must be interpreted as meaning that a person who is the contractual holder of certain intellectual property rights, who does not however use them himself or herself, but merely claims damages from alleged infringers, may benefit from the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in Chapter\u00a0II of that directive.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That question must be understood as covering three parts, namely, first, that relating to the legal standing of a person such as Mircom to seek the application of the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in Chapter\u00a0II of Directive 2004/48, secondly, the question whether such a person may have suffered prejudice within the meaning of Article\u00a013 of that directive and, thirdly, the question concerning the admissibility of his or her request for information, pursuant to Article\u00a08 of that directive, read in conjunction with Article\u00a03(2) thereof.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the first part, relating to Mircom\u2019s legal standing to bring proceedings, it must be borne in mind that the person seeking the application of the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in Chapter\u00a0II of Directive 2004/48 must fall within one of the four categories of persons or bodies listed in Article\u00a04(a) to (d) thereof.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those categories include, first, holders of intellectual property rights, secondly, all the other persons authorised to use those rights, in particular licensees, thirdly, intellectual property collective rights management bodies which are regularly recognised as having a right to represent holders of intellectual property rights, and, fourth, professional defence bodies which are regularly recognised as having a right to represent holders of intellectual property rights.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, unlike the holders of intellectual property rights referred to in Article\u00a04(a) of Directive 2004/48, in accordance with recital\u00a018 of that directive, the three categories of persons referred to in Article\u00a04(b) to (d) thereof must also have a direct interest in the defence of those rights and the right to be a party to legal proceedings in so far as permitted by, and in accordance with, the applicable legislation (see, to that effect, judgment of 7\u00a0August 2018, \nSNB-REACT\n, C-521/17, EU:C:2018:639, paragraph\u00a039).\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the possibility that Mircom may be a collective management body or a professional defence body within the meaning of Article\u00a04(c) and (d) of Directive 2004/48 should be ruled out from the outset. As the Advocate General observed in points\u00a092 and 93 of his Opinion, Mircom does not, as it itself states, have the task of managing the copyright and related rights of its contractual parties or of ensuring the professional defence of the latter, but seeks solely to obtain compensation for prejudice resulting from infringements of those rights.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, it should be noted that the activities of those bodies are harmonised within the Union by Directive 2014/26. Mircom\u2019s name does not appear on the list of collective management bodies published by the European Commission in accordance with Article\u00a039 of that directive.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the status of holder of intellectual property rights, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(a) of Directive 2004/48, in so far as that provision does not require such a rightholder to actually use his or her intellectual property rights, that right cannot be excluded from the scope of that provision on account of the non-use of those rights.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that the referring court classifies Mircom as a person who is contractually the holder of copyright or related rights. In those circumstances, Mircom should be granted the benefit of the measures, procedures and remedies provided for by Directive 2004/48 notwithstanding the fact that it does not use those rights.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A company such as Mircom could, moreover, be considered, in any event, to be another person authorised to use intellectual property rights within the meaning of Article\u00a04(b) of that directive, it being understood that that authorisation also does not presuppose an actual use of the assigned rights. The fact of being classified as an \u2018other person\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(b) of that directive, must, however, as noted in paragraph\u00a064 above, be verified in accordance with the provisions of the applicable legislation, that reference having to be understood, in the light of Article\u00a02(1) of that directive, as referring both to the relevant national legislation and, as the case may be, to EU legislation (see, to that effect, judgment of 7\u00a0August 2018, \nSNB-REACT\n, C-521/17, EU:C:2018:639, paragraph\u00a031).\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the second part of the second question, it concerns, in particular, the fact that, in the present case, Mircom does not use and does not appear to have any intention of using the rights acquired over the works at issue in the main proceedings. According to the referring court, that non-use of the assigned rights casts doubt on the possibility of such a person suffering prejudice within the meaning of Article\u00a013 of Directive 2004/48.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That question concerns the actual identity of the injured party who has suffered, here, prejudice, within the meaning of Article\u00a013 of that directive, as a result of the infringement of intellectual property rights, namely whether the prejudice at issue was suffered by Mircom or by the producers of the films concerned.\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that holders of intellectual property rights, referred to in Article\u00a04(a) of Directive 2004/48, and the persons authorised to use those rights, referred to in Article\u00a04(b) of that directive, may be harmed, in principle, by infringing activities, in so far as, as the Advocate General noted, in essence, in point\u00a070 of his Opinion, those activities may hinder the normal use of those rights or diminish their revenue. However, it is also possible that a person, while having intellectual property rights, may merely recover, in his or her own name and on his or her own behalf, damages in respect of claims assigned to him or her by other holders of intellectual property rights.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the referring court appears to take the view that Mircom merely acts, before it, as assignee, providing the film producers at issue with a service for the collection of claims for damages.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be held that the fact that a person referred to in Article\u00a04 of Directive 2004/48 merely brings such an action as assignee is not such as to exclude him or her from the benefit of the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in Chapter\u00a0II of that directive.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such an exclusion runs counter to the general objective of Directive 2004/48, which is, as is clear from recital\u00a010 thereof, to ensure a high level of protection of intellectual property in the internal market (see, to that effect, judgment of 18\u00a0January 2017, \nNEW WAVE CZ\n, C-427/15, EU:C:2017:18, paragraph\u00a023).\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted, in that regard, that an assignment of claims cannot, in itself, affect the nature of the rights which have been infringed, in the present case, the intellectual property rights of the film producers concerned, in particular in the sense that that assignment has an effect on the determination of the court having jurisdiction or on other procedural aspects, such as the possibility of seeking measures, procedures and remedies, within the meaning of Chapter\u00a0II of Directive 2004/48 (see, by analogy, judgment of 21\u00a0May 2015, \nCDC Hydrogen Peroxide\n, C-352/13, EU:C:2015:335, paragraphs\u00a035 and 36 and the case-law cited).\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, if a holder of intellectual property rights chose to outsource the recovery of damages to a specialised undertaking by assigning claims or another legal act, he or she should not suffer less favourable treatment than another owner of such rights who would choose to assert those rights personally. Such treatment would undermine the attractiveness of that outsourcing from an economic point of view and would ultimately deprive holders of intellectual property rights of that possibility, which is moreover widespread in various fields of law, such as that of protection of air passengers, provided for in Regulation (EC) No\u00a0261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11\u00a0February 2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No\u00a0295/91 (OJ 2004 L\u00a046, p.\u00a01).\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the third part of its second question, the referring court harbours doubts, in essence, as to the admissibility of Mircom\u2019s request for information, made under Article\u00a08 of Directive 2004/48, in so far as that company does not make serious use of the rights which it has acquired from the film producers at issue in the main proceedings. Furthermore, it must be understood that, by referring to the possibility of classifying Mircom as a \u2018copyright troll\u2019, the referring court raises, in essence, the question of the existence of a possible abuse of rights by Mircom.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, the referring court appears to be doubtful as to whether Mircom intended to bring an action for damages, in so far as there is strong evidence that, generally, it merely proposes an amicable settlement with the sole aim of obtaining a lump sum of damages of EUR\u00a0500. In accordance with Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 2004/48, a request for information must be made in the context of proceedings relating to an infringement of an intellectual property right.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted by the Advocate General in point\u00a0113 of his Opinion, it must be held, in that regard, that seeking an amicable solution is often a prerequisite for bringing an action for damages in the strict sense. Consequently, it cannot be considered that, in the context of the system for the protection of intellectual property established by Directive 2004/48, that practice is prohibited.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already held that Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 2004/48 must be interpreted as applying to a situation in which, after the definitive termination of proceedings in which it was held that an intellectual property right was infringed, an applicant in separate proceedings seeks information on the origin and distribution networks of the goods or services by which that intellectual property right is infringed (judgment of 18\u00a0January 2017, \nNEW WAVE CZ\n, C-427/15, EU:C:2017:18, paragraph\u00a028).\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is appropriate to apply the same reasoning in relation to a separate procedure preceding an action for damages, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which, under Article\u00a08(1)(c) of Directive 2004/48, an applicant requests an Internet service provider, such as Telenet, which has been found to be providing, on a commercial scale, services used in infringing activities, the information enabling its customers to be identified with a view, specifically, to being able usefully to bring legal proceedings against the alleged infringers.\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right to information, provided for in Article\u00a08 of the Charter, seeks to apply and implement the fundamental right to an effective remedy guaranteed in Article\u00a047 of the Charter, and thereby to ensure the effective exercise of the fundamental right to property, which includes the intellectual property right protected in Article\u00a017(2) of the Charter by enabling the holder of an intellectual property right to identify the person who is infringing that right and take the necessary steps in order to protect it (judgment of 9\u00a0July 2020, \nConstantin Film Verleih\n, C-264/19, EU:C:2020:542, paragraph\u00a035).\n84\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, it must be held that a request for information such as that made by Mircom during a pre-litigation stage cannot, for that reason alone, be regarded as inadmissible.\n85\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, according to Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 2004/48, such a request must be justified and proportionate.\n86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be stated, in the light of the considerations set out in paragraphs\u00a070 to 77 above, that that may be the case where the request referred to in Article\u00a08(1), is submitted by a company which is contractually authorised in that regard by film producers. It is, however, for the referring court to determine whether the request, as specifically formulated by such a company, is well founded.\n87\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, referring to the expression \u2018any unfair profits made by the infringer\u2019, used in point\u00a0(a) of the second subparagraph of Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 2004/48, and to the condition laid down in Article\u00a06(2), Article\u00a08(1) and Article\u00a09(2) thereof, that infringements must be carried out on a commercial scale, the referring court considers that the EU legislature had in mind here the situation requiring structural action against the spread of counterfeiting on the market, and not the fight against individual infringers.\n88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted, first, that, in accordance with recital\u00a014 of Directive 2004/48, the condition that infringements must be carried out on a commercial scale need to be applied only to measures relating to the evidence provided for in Article\u00a06 of that directive, to the measures concerning the right to information provided for in Article\u00a08 thereof and to the provisional and protective measures provided for in Article\u00a09 of that directive, without prejudice to the possibility for Member States also to apply those measures to acts which are not carried out on a commercial scale.\n89\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That condition does not apply to the injured party\u2019s claims for damages against an infringer referred to in Article\u00a013 of Directive 2004/48. Consequently, under that provision, individual infringers may be ordered to pay the owner of the intellectual property rights damages appropriate to the actual prejudice suffered by him as a result of the infringement, provided that the infringer knowingly or with reasonable grounds to know engaged in the infringing activity.\n90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in the context of a request for information under Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 2004/48, the condition that the infringements must be committed in a commercial context may be satisfied in particular where a person other than the alleged infringer \u2018was found to be providing on a commercial scale services used in infringing activities\u2019.\n91\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, Mircom\u2019s request for information is, as stated in paragraph\u00a082 of the present judgment, directed against an Internet service provider, as a person found in the process of providing, on a commercial scale, services used in infringing activities.\n92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, in the dispute in the main proceedings, Mircom\u2019s request against Telenet, which provides, on a commercial scale, services used in infringing activities, appears to satisfy the condition referred to in paragraph\u00a090 of the present judgment.\n93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it is for the referring court to ascertain, in any event, whether Mircom has abused measures, procedures and remedies within the meaning of Article\u00a03 of Directive 2004/48 and, if necessary, to refuse that company\u2019s request.\n94\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03 of Directive 2004/48 imposes a general obligation to ensure, inter alia, that the measures, procedures and remedies necessary to ensure the enforcement of the intellectual property rights covered by that directive, including the right of information referred to in Article\u00a08, are fair and equitable and applied in such a way as to provide for safeguards against their abuse.\n95\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The possible finding of such abuse falls entirely within the scope of the assessment of the facts in the main proceedings and, therefore, within the jurisdiction of the referring court. That court could in particular, to that end, examine Mircom\u2019s operating method, by evaluating the way in which Mircom offers amicable solutions to alleged infringers and by ascertaining whether it actually brings legal proceedings in the event of a refusal to reach an amicable solution. It could also examine whether, in the light of all the particular circumstances of the present case, Mircom is in fact attempting, under the guise of proposing amicable solutions to alleged infringements, to extract economic revenue from the very membership of the users concerned in a peer-to-peer network such as the one at issue, without specifically seeking to combat the copyright infringements caused by that network.\n96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Directive 2004/48 must be interpreted as meaning that a person who is the contractual holder of certain intellectual property rights, who does not however use them himself or herself, but merely claims damages from alleged infringers, may benefit, in principle, from the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in Chapter II of that directive, unless it is established, in accordance with the general obligation laid down in Article\u00a03(2) of that directive and on the basis of an overall and detailed assessment, that his or her request is abusive. In particular, as regards a request for information based on Article\u00a08 of that directive, it must also be rejected if it is unjustified or disproportionate, which is for the referring court to determine.\n\u00a0\nThe third and fourth questions\n97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, in the case in the main proceedings, there are two different types of personal data processing at issue, namely one which has already been carried out, upstream, by Media Protector and on behalf of Mircom, in the context of peer-to-peer networks, consisting of the recording of the IP addresses of users whose Internet connections were allegedly used, at a given time, for the uploading of protected works on those networks, and the other, which, according to Mircom, must be carried out downstream by Telenet, consisting, first, of the identification of those users by means of a match between those IP addresses and those which, at the same time, Telenet had allocated to those users for the purpose of carrying out that uploading and, second, of the communication to Mircom of the names and addresses of the same users.\n98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its fourth question, the referring court seeks an answer as to whether, in the light of point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679, only the first processing which has already been carried out is justified.\n99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in its third question, it seeks to ascertain, in essence, whether the circumstances set out in its first and second questions are relevant for the purposes of assessing the fair balance between, on the one hand, the right to intellectual property and, on the other hand, the protection of privacy and personal data, in particular in the assessment of proportionality.\n100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that, on the basis of the Court\u2019s answers to the first and second questions, the referring court finds that Mircom\u2019s request for information satisfies the conditions laid down in Article\u00a08 of Directive 2004/48, read in conjunction with Article\u00a03(2) thereof, it must be understood that, by its third question, the referring court seeks to ascertain, in essence, whether, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as precluding the second downstream processing, as described in paragraph\u00a097 of the present judgment, even though that request satisfies those conditions.\n101\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of those considerations and in accordance with the case-law cited in paragraphs\u00a038 and 39 of the present judgment, it is necessary to reformulate the third and fourth questions to the effect that, by those questions, the referring court asks, in essence, whether point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as precluding, first, the systematic registration, by the holder of intellectual property rights and by a third party acting on that holder\u2019s behalf, of the IP addresses of users of peer-to-peer networks whose Internet connections have allegedly been used in infringing activities and, second, the communication of the names and of postal addresses of those users to the rightholder or to a third party in order to enable him or her to bring a claim for damages before a civil court for prejudice allegedly caused by those users.\n102\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, as regards the upstream processing at issue in the main proceedings, it must be recalled that a dynamic IP address registered by an online media services provider when a person accesses a website which that provider makes accessible to the public constitutes personal data, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1) of Regulation 2016/679, in relation to that provider, where the latter has the legal means which enable it to identify the data subject with additional data which the Internet service provider has about that person (judgment of 19\u00a0October 2016, \nBreyer\n, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph\u00a049).\n103\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the registration of such addresses for the purposes of their subsequent use in legal proceedings constitutes processing within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) of Regulation 2016/679.\n104\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is also the situation of Mircom, on behalf of whom Media Protector collects the IP addresses, in so far as it has a legal means of identifying the owners of the Internet connections in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article\u00a08 of Directive 2004/48.\n105\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679, the processing of personal data is lawful only if it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n106\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, that provision lays down three cumulative conditions so that the processing of personal data is lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by a third party; second, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and third, that the interests or freedoms and fundamental rights of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence (see, to that effect, as regards Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 4\u00a0May 2017, \nR\u012bgas satiksme\n, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph\u00a028).\n107\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Regulation 2016/679 repealed and replaced Directive 95/46 and the relevant provisions of that regulation have essentially the same scope as that of the relevant provisions of that directive, the Court\u2019s case-law on that directive is also applicable, in principle, to that regulation (see, by analogy, judgment of 12\u00a0November 2020, \nSonaecom\n, C-42/19, EU:C:2020:913, paragraph\u00a029).\n108\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the condition relating to the pursuit of a legitimate interest and subject to verifications which it is for the referring court to carry out in the context of the second question, it must be held that the interest of the controller or of a third party in obtaining the personal information of a person who allegedly damaged their property in order to sue that person for damages can be qualified as a legitimate interest. That analysis is supported by Article\u00a09(2)(e) and (f) of Regulation 2016/679, which provides that the prohibition on the processing of certain types of personal data, such as that revealing the sex life or sexual orientation of a natural person, is not to apply, in particular, where the processing concerns personal data which is clearly rendered public by the person concerned or is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (see, to that effect, as regards Article\u00a08(2)(e) of Directive 95/46, judgment of 4\u00a0May 2017, \nR\u012bgas satiksme\n, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph\u00a029).\n109\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, as the Advocate General stated, in essence, in point\u00a0131 of his Opinion, the recovery of claims in the prescribed manner by an assignee may constitute a legitimate interest justifying the processing of personal data in accordance with point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679 (see, by analogy, as regards Directive 2002/58, judgment of 22\u00a0November 2012, \nProbst\n, C-119/12, EU:C:2012:748, paragraph\u00a019).\n110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the condition relating to the necessity of processing personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued, it should be borne in mind that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2017, \nR\u012bgas satiksme\n, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph\u00a030). That condition could, in the present case, be satisfied since, as the Advocate General observed in point\u00a097 of his Opinion, identification of the owner of the connection is often possible only on the basis of the IP address and the information provided by the Internet service provider.\n111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, as regards the condition of balancing of the opposing rights and interests at issue, it depends in principle on the specific circumstances of the particular case (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2017, \nR\u012bgas satiksme\n, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph\u00a031 and the case-law cited). It is for the referring court to assess those particular circumstances.\n112\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the mechanisms allowing the different rights and interests to be balanced are contained in Regulation 2016/679 itself (see, by analogy, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008, \nPromusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraph\u00a066 and the case-law cited).\n113\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, in so far as the facts in the main proceedings seem to fall within both the scope of Regulation 2016/679 and that of Directive 2002/58, the IP addresses processed constitute, as is clear from the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a0102 of the present judgment both personal data and traffic data (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0152), it must be ascertained whether the assessment of the lawfulness of such processing must take account of the conditions laid down by that directive.\n114\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from Article\u00a01(2) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a094(2) of Regulation 2016/679, the provisions of that directive specify and supplement that regulation in order to harmonise the national provisions necessary to ensure, in particular, an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy, as regards the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector (see, to that effect, judgments of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraph\u00a031, and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0102).\n115\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, under Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2002/58, Member States are to prohibit listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communications and the related traffic data by persons other than users, without the consent of the users concerned, except when legally authorised to do so in accordance with Article\u00a015(1) of that directive. Furthermore, under Article\u00a06(1) of that directive, traffic data relating to subscribers and users processed and stored by the provider of a public communications network or publicly available electronic communications service must be erased or made anonymous when it is no longer needed for the purpose of the transmission of a communication without prejudice, in particular, to Article\u00a015(1) of that directive.\n116\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a015(1) ends the list of exceptions to the obligation to ensure the confidentiality of personal data with an express reference to Article\u00a013(1) of Directive 95/46, corresponding, in essence, to Article\u00a023(1) of Regulation 2016/679, which now allows both EU law and the law of the Member State to which the controller or processor is subject to restrict, by means of legislative measures, the scope of the obligation of confidentiality of personal data in the electronic communications sector, where that restriction respects the essence of the freedoms and the fundamental freedoms and that it constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to ensure, in particular, the protection of the rights and freedoms of others and the enforcement of civil law claims (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008, \nPromusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraph\u00a053).\n117\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the fact that Article\u00a023(1)(j) of that regulation now expressly refers to the enforcement of claims under civil law must be interpreted as expressing the intention of the EU legislature to confirm the case-law of the Court according to which the protection of the right to property and situations in which authors seek to obtain such protection in civil proceedings have never been excluded from the scope of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008, \nPromusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraph\u00a053).\n118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, in order for processing, such as the registration of IP addresses of persons whose Internet connections have been used to upload pieces of files containing protected works on peer-to-peer networks, for the purposes of filing a request for disclosure of the names and postal addresses of the holders of those IP addresses, can be regarded as lawful by satisfying the conditions laid down by Regulation 2016/679, it is necessary, in particular, to ascertain whether that processing satisfies the abovementioned provisions of Directive 2002/58, which embodies, for users of electronic communications, the fundamental rights to respect for private life and the protection of personal data (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0109).\n119\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the absence in the order for reference of details relating to the legal basis for Mircom\u2019s access to the IP addresses retained by Telenet, the Court is not in a position to provide the referring court with useful guidance as to whether processing such as that carried out upstream, consisting of the registration of those IP addresses, undermines those fundamental rights, in the light of the rules set out in Directive 2002/58 and the condition relating to the balancing of conflicting rights and interests. It will be for the referring court to analyse the relevant national legislation in the light of EU law, in particular Articles\u00a05, 6 and 15 of Directive 2002/58.\n120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, as regards Telenet\u2019s downstream processing, which consists of identifying the holders of those IP addresses and communicating to Mircom the names and postal addresses of those holders, it should be noted that a request, in accordance with Article\u00a08 of Directive 2004/48, limited to the disclosure of the names and addresses of users involved in infringing activities is consistent with the objective of striking a fair balance between the rights of intellectual property rightholders and the right of users to protection of personal data (see, to that effect, judgment of 9\u00a0July 2020, \nConstantin Film Verleih\n, C-264/19, EU:C:2020:542, paragraphs\u00a037 and 38 and the case-law cited).\n121\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such data relating to the civil identity of users of electronic communications systems do not normally, in themselves, make it possible to ascertain the date, time, duration and recipients of the communications made, or the locations where those communications took place or their frequency with specific people during a given period, with the result that they do not provide, apart from the contact details of those users, such as their civil status, addresses, any information on the communications sent and, consequently, on the users\u2019 private lives. Thus, the interference entailed by a measure relating to those data cannot, in principle, be classified as serious (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0March 2021, \nProkuratuur (Conditions of access to data relating to electronic communications)\n, C-746/18, EU:C:2021:152, paragraph\u00a034 and the case-law cited).\n122\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, in the case in the main proceedings, Mircom\u2019s request for information presupposes that Telenet performs a match between the dynamic IP addresses recorded on behalf of Mircom and those allocated by Telenet to those users, who have allowed them to participate in the peer-to-peer network at issue.\n123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, as is apparent from the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a0113 of the present judgment, such a request concerns the processing of traffic data. The right to protection of that data, which is enjoyed by the persons referred to in Article\u00a08(1) of Directive 2004/48, forms part of the fundamental right of every person to have his or her personal data protected, as guaranteed by Article\u00a08 of the Charter and Regulation 2016/679, as clarified and supplemented by Directive 2002/58 (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2015, \nCoty Germany\n, C-580/13, EU:C:2015:485, paragraph\u00a030).\n124\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The application of the measures provided for by Directive 2004/48 cannot, in fact, affect Regulation 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58 (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2015, \nCoty Germany\n, C-580/13, EU:C:2015:485, paragraph\u00a032).\n125\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Court has already held that Article\u00a08(3) of Directive\u00a02004/48, read in conjunction with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive\u00a02002/58 and Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, does not preclude Member States from imposing an obligation to disclose to private persons personal data in order to enable them to bring civil proceedings for copyright infringements, but nor does it require those Member States to lay down such an obligation (see, to that effect, judgments of 19\u00a0April 2012, \nBonnier Audio and Others\n, C-461/10, EU:C:2012:219, paragraph\u00a055 and the case-law cited, and of 4\u00a0May 2017, \nR\u012bgas satiksme\n, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph\u00a034).\n126\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that, like Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, neither point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679 nor Article\u00a09(2)(f) of that regulation, although directly applicable in any Member State, by virtue of the second paragraph of Article\u00a0288 TFEU, imposes an obligation on a third party, such as an Internet service provider, to communicate to private persons, as recipients, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(9) of that regulation, personal data for the purpose of prosecuting copyright infringements before the civil courts, but merely regulate the issue of the lawfulness of the processing by the controller itself or by a third party, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(10) of that regulation.\n127\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, an Internet service provider such as Telenet could be obliged to make such a communication only on the basis of a measure, referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, which limits the scope of the rights and obligations laid down, inter alia, in Articles\u00a05 and 6 thereof.\n128\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as the order for reference contains no information in that regard, the referring court will have to ascertain the legal basis both of Telenet\u2019s retention of the IP addresses of which Mircom requests disclosure and of any access to those addresses by Mircom.\n129\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a06(1) and (2) of Directive 2002/58, the retention of IP addresses by providers of electronic communications services beyond the period for which that data is assigned does not, in principle, appear to be necessary for the purpose of billing the services at issue, with the result that the detection of offences committed online may therefore prove impossible without recourse to a legislative measure under Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0154).\n130\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point\u00a0104 of his Opinion, if the retention of IP addresses on the basis of such a legislative measure or, at the very least, their use for purposes other than those considered to be lawful in the judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791), were to be regarded as contrary to EU law, the request for information in the main proceedings would become devoid of purpose.\n131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If it were to follow from the investigations carried out by the referring court that there are national legislative measures, within the meaning of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, which limit the scope of the rules laid down in Articles\u00a05 and 6 of that directive and which could usefully apply to the present case, and on the assumption that it is also apparent, on the basis of the interpretative guidance provided by the Court in all of the preceding paragraphs of the present judgment, that Mircom has legal standing to bring proceedings and that its request for information is justified, proportionate and not abusive, the abovementioned processing must be regarded as lawful, within the meaning of Regulation 2016/679.\n132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the third and fourth questions is that point\u00a0(f) of the first subparagraph of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation 2016/679, read in conjunction with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes in principle, neither the systematic recording, by the holder of intellectual property rights as well as by a third party on his or her behalf, of IP addresses of users of peer-to-peer networks whose Internet connections have allegedly been used in infringing activities, nor the communication of the names and of the postal addresses of those users to that rightholder or to a third party in order to enable it to bring claim for damages before a civil court for prejudice allegedly caused by those users, provided, however, that the initiatives and the requests to that effect by that rightholder or such a third party are justified, proportionate and not abusive and have their legal basis in a national legislative measure, within the meaning of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, which limits the scope of the rules laid down in Articles\u00a05 and 6 of that directive.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n133\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a03(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22\u00a0May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society must be interpreted as meaning that the uploading, from the terminal equipment of a user of a peer-to-peer network to such equipment of other users of that network, of pieces, previously downloaded by that user, of a media file containing a protected work, even though those pieces are usable in themselves only as from a certain download rate, constitutes making available to the public within the meaning of that provision. It is irrelevant that, due to the configurations of the BitTorrent client sharing software, that uploading is automatically generated by it, when the user, from whose terminal equipment that uploading takes place, has subscribed to that software by giving his or her consent to its application after having been duly informed of its characteristics.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDirective 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29\u00a0April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights must be interpreted as meaning that a person who is the contractual holder of certain intellectual property rights, who does not however use them himself or herself, but merely claims damages for alleged infringers, may benefit, in principle, from the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in Chapter II of that directive, unless it is established, in accordance with the general obligation laid down in Article\u00a03(2) of that directive and on the basis of an overall and detailed assessment, that his or her request is abusive. In particular, as regards a request for information based on Article\u00a08 of that directive, it must also be rejected if it is unjustified or disproportionate, which is for the referring court to determine.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPoint\u00a0(f) of subparagraph 1 of Article\u00a06(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), read in conjunction with Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009, must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes in principle, neither the systematic recording, by the holder of intellectual property rights as well as by a third party on his or her behalf, of IP addresses of users of peer-to-peer networks whose Internet connections have allegedly been used in infringing activities, nor the communication of the names and of the postal addresses of those users to that rightholder or to a third party in order to enable it to bring a claim for damages before a civil court for prejudice allegedly caused by those users, provided, however, that the initiatives and requests to that effect of that rightholder or of such a third party are justified, proportionate and not abusive and have their legal basis in a national legislative measure, within the meaning of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, which limits the scope of the rules laid down in Articles\u00a05 and 6 of that directive, as amended."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

which he owns, located in the building M5A.\u00a0At the request of certain co-owners of that building, the association of co-owners adopted, at a general assembly held on 7\u00a0April 2016, a decision approving the installation of video surveillance cameras in that building.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In implementation of that decision, three video surveillance cameras were installed in the common parts of the M5A building. The first camera was pointed towards the front of the building, whereas the second and third cameras were installed, respectively, in the ground-floor hallway and in the building\u2019s lift.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TK objected to that video surveillance system being installed, on the ground that it constituted an infringement of the right to respect for private life.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having found that, notwithstanding the numerous steps undertaken by him and the written acknowledgment of the association of co-owners that the video surveillance system installed was unlawful, that system continued to operate, TK brought an action before the referring court requesting that the association of co-owners be ordered to remove the three cameras and to take them out of operation definitively, failing which a penalty payment would be imposed.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TK argued before the referring court that the video surveillance system at issue infringed EU primary and secondary law, in particular the right to respect for private life both under EU and national law. He also stated that the association of co-owners had taken on the task of data controller for personal data without having followed the registration procedure in that regard provided for by law.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The association of co-owners stated that the decision to install a video surveillance system had been taken in order to monitor as effectively as possible who enters and leaves the building, since the lift had been vandalised on many occasions and there had been burglaries and thefts in several apartments and the common parts.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The association also stated that other measures which it had taken previously, namely the installation of an intercom/magnetic card entry system, had not prevented repeat offences of the same nature being committed.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the association of co-owners sent TK the memorandum which it had drawn up with the company which had installed the video surveillance cameras, stating that on 21\u00a0October 2016 the system\u2019s hard drive had been erased and disconnected, that it had been taken out of operation and that the images recorded had been deleted.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The association also communicated to TK another memorandum, dated 18\u00a0May 2017 from which it is apparent that the three video surveillance cameras had been uninstalled. That memorandum stated that the association of co-owners had, in the meantime, completed the procedure enabling it to be registered as data controller responsible for personal data.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TK stated, however, before the referring court that the three video surveillance cameras were still in place.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court notes that Article\u00a05 of Law No\u00a0677/2001 provides, in a general manner, that processing of personal data, such as the recording of images by means of a video surveillance system, may be carried out only if the data subject has given his or her express and unequivocal consent. Paragraph\u00a02 of that article sets out, however, a series of exceptions to that rule, which include the exception whereby the processing of personal data is required in order to protect the data subject\u2019s life, physical integrity or health or those of a threatened third party. Decision No\u00a052/2012 of the ANSPDCP provides for the same type of exception.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court makes reference, next, to Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter enshrining the principle that there must be proportionality between the aim pursued by the interference with the rights and freedoms of citizens and the means used.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to that court, the video surveillance system at issue before it does not seem to have been used in a manner or for a purpose not corresponding to the stated objective of the association of co-owners, which is that of protecting the life, physical integrity or health of the data subjects, namely the co-owners of the building in which that system was installed.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances Tribunalul Bucure\u015fti (Regional Court, Bucharest, Romania) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are Articles\u00a08 and 52 of the Charter and Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 to be interpreted as precluding provisions of national law such as those at issue in the main proceedings, namely Article\u00a05(2) of [Law No\u00a0677/2001], and Article\u00a06 of [Decision No\u00a052/2012 of the ANSPDCP], in accordance with which video surveillance may be used to ensure the safety and protection of individuals, property and valuables and for the pursuit of legitimate interests, without the data subject\u2019s consent?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are Articles\u00a08 and 52 of the Charter to be interpreted as meaning that the limitation of rights and freedoms which results from video surveillance is in accordance with the principle of proportionality, satisfies the requirement of being \u2018necessary\u2019 and \u2018meets objectives of general interest or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others\u2019, where the controller is able to take other measures to protect the legitimate interest in question?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 to be interpreted as meaning that the \u2018legitimate interests\u2019 of the controller must be proven, present and effective at the time of the data processing?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a06(1)(e) of Directive 95/46 to be interpreted as meaning that data processing (video surveillance) is excessive or inappropriate where the controller is able to take other measures to protect the legitimate interest in question?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, it must be found that although the referring court does, by its fourth question, refer to Article\u00a06(1)(e) of Directive 95/46, it provides no explanation as to the relevance of that provision to the outcome of the dispute in the main proceedings.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06(1)(e) relates only to the requirements governing the storage of personal data. Nothing in the documents before the Court permits the inference that the dispute in the main proceedings concerns that aspect.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, in so far as by that question the referring court asks, in essence, whether the installation of a video surveillance system, such as that at issue before it, is proportionate to the purposes pursued, it must be found that the issue of whether personal data collected by that system meet the requirement of proportionality relates to the interpretation of Article\u00a06(1)(c) of Directive 95/46.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a06(1)(c) of Directive 95/46 must be taken into account when verifying the second condition of application laid down in Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, according to which the processing of personal data is \u2018necessary\u2019 for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, by its first and second questions, Tribunalul Bucure\u015fti (Regional Court, Bucharest, Romania) refers to Articles\u00a08 and 52 of the Charter, taken in isolation or read in conjunction with Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46. The Court has made clear that the assessment of the condition laid down in that provision, relating to the existence of fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which override the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, necessitates a balancing of the opposing rights and interests concerned which depends on the individual circumstances of the particular case in question, and in the context of which account must be taken of the significance of the data subject\u2019s rights arising from Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter (judgment of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nAsociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Establecimientos Financieros de Cr\u00e9dito\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraph\u00a040). It follows that Articles\u00a08 and 52 of the Charter must not, in the present case, be applied in isolation.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, it must be found that, by its questions, which must be examined together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a06(1)(c) and Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national provisions which authorise the installation of a system of video surveillance, such as the system at issue in the main proceedings, installed in the common parts of a residential building, for the purposes of pursuing legitimate interests of ensuring the safety and protection of individuals and property, without the data subject\u2019s consent.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be borne in mind that surveillance in the form of a video recording of persons, which is stored on a continuous recording device\u00a0\u2014 the hard disk drive\u00a0\u2014 constitutes, pursuant to Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 95/46, the automatic processing of personal data (judgment of 11\u00a0December 2014, \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraph\u00a025).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, a video surveillance system using a camera must be characterised as the automatic processing of personal data, within the meaning of that provision, where the device installed enables personal data, such as images allowing natural persons to be identified, to be recorded and stored. It is for the referring court to ascertain whether the system at issue in the main proceedings has such characteristics.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, all processing of personal data must comply, first, with the principles relating to data quality set out in Article\u00a06 of Directive 95/46 and, secondly, with one of the criteria for making data processing legitimate listed in Article\u00a07 of that directive (judgment of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a071 and the case-law cited).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a07 of Directive 95/46 sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of the cases in which the processing of personal data can be regarded as being lawful. The Member States cannot add new principles relating to the lawfulness of the processing of personal data in that article or impose additional requirements that have the effect of amending the scope of one of the six principles provided for in that article (judgment of 19\u00a0October 2016, \nBreyer\n, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph\u00a057).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in order to be considered lawful, the processing of personal data must come within one of the six cases provided for in Article\u00a07 of Directive 95/46.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The questions raised by the referring court concern, in particular, the principle relating to making data processing legitimate referred to in Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46; that provision was transposed into Romanian law by Article\u00a05(2)(e) of Law No\u00a0677/2001, and that article is also referred to in Article\u00a06 of Decision No\u00a052/2012 of the ANSPDCP as regards specifically the processing of personal data by video surveillance means.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 lays down three cumulative conditions in order for the processing of personal data to be lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed; secondly, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and thirdly, that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence over the legitimate interest pursued (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2017, \nR\u012bgas satiksme\n, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph\u00a028).\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be stated that Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 does not require the data subject\u2019s consent. Such consent, as a condition to which the processing of personal data is made subject, appears, however, only in Article\u00a07(a) of that directive.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the objective which the controller essentially seeks to achieve when he or she installs a video surveillance system such as that at issue in the main proceedings, namely protecting the property, health and life of the co-owners of a building, is likely to be characterised as a \u2018legitimate interest\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46. The first condition laid down in that provision appears, therefore, in principle, to be fulfilled (see, by analogy, judgment of 11\u00a0December 2014, \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraph\u00a034).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court is, however, uncertain whether the first of the conditions laid down in Article\u00a07(f) must be understood as meaning that the interests pursued by the controller at issue must, first, be \u2018proven\u2019 and, secondly be \u2018present and effective at the time of the data processing\u2019.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must be found that, as the Romanian and Czech Governments, Ireland, the Austrian Government, the Portuguese Government and the Commission have argued, since, in accordance with Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, the controller responsible for the processing of personal data or the third party to whom those data are disclosed must pursue legitimate interests justifying that processing, those interests must be present and effective as at the date of the data processing and must not be hypothetical at that date. It cannot, however, be necessarily required, at the time of examining all the circumstances of the case, that the safety of property and individuals was previously compromised.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the condition relating to the existence of a present and effective interest seems in any event to be fulfilled, since the referring court notes that thefts, burglaries and acts of vandalism had occurred before the video surveillance system was installed and that was despite the previous installation, in the entrance to the building, of a security system comprising an intercom/magnetic card entry.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the second condition laid down in Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, relating to the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued, the Court has pointed out that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (judgment of 4\u00a0May 2017, \nR\u012bgas satiksme\n, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph\u00a030 and the case-law cited).\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That condition requires the referring court to ascertain that the legitimate data processing interests pursued by the video surveillance at issue in the main proceedings\u00a0\u2014 which consist, in essence, in ensuring the security of property and individuals and preventing crime\u00a0\u2014 cannot reasonably be as effectively achieved by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, as the Commission maintained, the condition relating to the need for processing must be examined in conjunction with the \u2018data minimisation\u2019 principle enshrined in Article\u00a06(1)(c) of Directive 95/46, in accordance with which personal data must be \u2018adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed\u2019.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from the documents before the Court that the requirements linked to the proportionality of the processing of data at issue in the main proceedings seem to have been taken into account. It is not in dispute that alternative measures consisting in a security system, installed in the entrance to the building, and comprising an intercom/magnetic card entry, were initially put in place, but proved to be insufficient. In addition, the video surveillance device at issue is limited only to the common parts of the building in co-ownership and the approach to it.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the proportionality of the data processing by a video surveillance device must be assessed by taking into account the specific methods of installing and operating that device, which must limit the effect thereof on the rights and freedoms of data subjects while ensuring the effectiveness of the video surveillance system at issue.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, as the Commission contended, the condition relating to the need for processing implies that the controller must examine, for example, whether it is sufficient that the video surveillance operates only at night or outside normal working hours, and block or obscure the images taken in areas where surveillance is unnecessary.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, as regards the third condition laid down in Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, relating to the existence of fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject whose data require protection, which might override the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, it must be borne in mind, as mentioned in paragraph\u00a032 above, that the assessment of that condition necessitates a balancing of the opposing rights and interests concerned which depends on the individual circumstances of the particular case in question, and in the context of which account must be taken of the significance of the data subject\u2019s rights arising from Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the Court has held that Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46 precludes Member States from excluding, categorically and in general, the possibility of processing certain categories of personal data without allowing the opposing rights and interests at issue to be balanced against each other in a particular case. Thus, Member States cannot definitively prescribe, for certain categories of personal data, the result of the balancing of the opposing rights and interests, without allowing a different result by virtue of the particular circumstances of an individual case (judgment of 19\u00a0October 2016, \nBreyer\n, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph\u00a062).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also apparent from the case-law of the Court that it is possible to take into consideration, for the purposes of that balancing, the fact that the seriousness of the infringement of the data subject\u2019s fundamental rights resulting from that processing can vary depending on the possibility of accessing the data at issue in public sources (see, to that effect, judgment of 4\u00a0May 2017, \nR\u012bgas satiksme\n, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph\u00a032).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike the processing of data from public sources, the processing of data from non-public sources implies that information relating to the data subject\u2019s private life will thereafter be known by the data controller and, as the case may be, by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed. This more serious infringement of the data subject\u2019s rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter must be taken into account and be balanced against the legitimate interest pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed (see, to that effect, judgment of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nAsociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Establecimientos Financieros de Cr\u00e9dito\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraph\u00a045).\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The criterion relating to the seriousness of the infringement of the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms is an essential component of the weighing or balancing exercise on a case-by-case basis, required by Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, account must be taken, inter alia, of the nature of the personal data at issue, in particular of the potentially sensitive nature of those data, and of the nature and specific methods of processing the data at issue, in particular of the number of persons having access to those data and the methods of accessing them.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The data subject\u2019s reasonable expectations that his or her personal data will not be processed when, in the circumstance of the case, that person cannot reasonably expect further processing of those data, are also relevant for the purposes of the balancing exercise.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, those factors must be balanced against the importance, for all the co-owners of the building concerned, of the legitimate interests pursued in the instant case by the video surveillance system at issue, inasmuch as it seeks essentially to ensure that the property, health and life of those co-owners are protected.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the questions raised is that Article\u00a06(1)(c) and Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, must be interpreted as not precluding national provisions which authorise the installation of a video surveillance system, such as the system at issue in the main proceedings, installed in the common parts of a residential building, for the purposes of pursuing legitimate interests of ensuring the safety and protection of individuals and property, without the consent of the data subjects, if the processing of personal data carried out by means of the video surveillance system at issue fulfils the conditions laid down in Article\u00a07(f), which it is for the referring court to determine.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\nArticle\u00a06(1)(c) and Article\u00a07(f) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, read in the light of Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as not precluding national provisions which authorise the installation of a video surveillance system, such as the system at issue in the main proceedings, installed in the common parts of a residential building, for the purposes of pursuing legitimate interests of ensuring the safety and protection of individuals and property, without the consent of the data subjects, if the processing of personal data carried out by means of the video surveillance system at issue fulfils the conditions laid down in Article\u00a07(f), which it is for the referring court to determine."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 17 Jul 2014, C-141/12 (\nYS and Others\n)\nGeneral data protection law

copy of an administrative document drafted before the adoption of the decisions on their applications for residence permits.\n\u00a0\nLegal context\n\u00a0\nEU law\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Directive 95/46, the object of which, according to Article\u00a01, is to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data, and to remove obstacles to the free flow of personal data, states in recitals 25 and 41 in its preamble:\n\u2018(25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the principles of protection must be reflected, on the one hand, in the obligations imposed on persons ... responsible for processing, in particular regarding data quality, technical security, notification to the supervisory authority, and the circumstances under which processing can be carried out, and, on the other hand, in the right conferred on individuals, the data on whom are the subject of processing, to be informed that processing is taking place, to consult the data, to request corrections and even to object to processing in certain circumstances;\n...\n(41)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas any person must be able to exercise the right of access to data relating to him which are being processed, in order to verify in particular the accuracy of the data and the lawfulness of the processing; ...\u2019\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 is defined in Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 as \u2018any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d)\u2019.\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a012 of that directive, entitled \u2018Right of access\u2019, provides as follows: \n\u2018Member States shall guarantee every data subject the right to obtain from the controller:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0without constraint at reasonable intervals and without excessive delay or expense:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0confirmation as to whether or not data relating to him are being processed and information at least as to the purposes of the

object to the processing of data relating to him.\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Articles\u00a022 and 23(1) of the directive, Member States are to provide for the right of every person to a judicial remedy for any breach of the rights guaranteed to him by the national law applicable to the processing in question and to provide that any person who has suffered damage as a result of an unlawful processing operation or of any act incompatible with the national provisions adopted pursuant to the directive is entitled to receive compensation from the controller for the damage suffered.\n\u00a0\nNetherlands law\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles\u00a02, 12 and 13 of Directive 95/46 were transposed into national law by Articles\u00a01, 35 and 43 respectively of the Law on the Protection of Personal Data (Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens, \u2018the Wbp\u2019).\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a035 of the Wbp is worded as follows:\n\u2018The data subject shall have the right to apply to the controller without restraint and at reasonable intervals to be notified as to whether data relating to him are being processed. The controller shall notify the data subject in writing within four weeks if data relating to him are being processed.\nWhere such data are being processed, such notification shall contain a full overview thereof in an intelligible form, a description of the purpose or purposes of the processing, the categories of data concerned and the recipients or categories of recipients, as well as any available information as to the source of the data.\u2019\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a043(e) of the Wbp, the controller can exclude application of Article\u00a035 of the Wbp in so far as is necessary in the interests of protecting the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a029(1)(a) of the Law on Foreign Nationals 2000 (Vreemdelingenwet 2000, the \u2018Vw 2000\u2019), a residence permit for a fixed period may be granted to a foreign national who is a refugee. Under Article\u00a029(1)(b) of that law, such a permit may also be granted to a foreign national who has proved that he has good grounds for believing that if he is expelled he will run a real risk of being subjected to the death penalty or execution, to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or to serious and individual threat to a civilian\u2019s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict.\n\u00a0\nThe disputes in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The case officer of the Immigration and Naturalisation Service responsible for dealing with an application for a residence permit draws up, where he is not authorised to sign the decision, a draft decision which is submitted for assessment to a reviser in that service. The case officer attaches a document in which he explains to the reviser the reasons for his draft decision (\u2018the minute\u2019). Where the case officer has the authority to sign, the minute is not submitted to a reviser but is used as an explanatory memorandum of the decision making process to justify the decision internally. The minute is part of the preparatory process within that service but not of the final decision, even though some points mentioned in it may reappear in the statement of reasons of that decision.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Generally, the minute contains the following information: name, telephone and office number of the case officer responsible for preparing the decision; boxes for the initials and names of revisers; data relating to the applicant, such as name, date of birth, nationality, gender, ethnicity, religion and language; details of the procedural history; details of the statements made by the applicant and the documents submitted; the legal provisions which are applicable; and, finally, an assessment of the foregoing information in the light of the applicable legal provisions. This assessment is referred to as the \u2018legal analysis\u2019.\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Depending on the case, the legal analysis may be more or less extensive, varying from a few sentences to several pages. In an in-depth analysis, the case officer responsible for the preparation of the decision addresses, inter alia, the credibility of the statements made and explains why he considers an applicant eligible or not for a residence permit. A summary analysis may merely refer to the application of a particular policy line.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Until 14\u00a0July 2009, the Minister\u2019s policy was to make the minute available upon mere request. Taking the view that the large number of those requests resulted in too great a work load, that the data subjects often misinterpreted the legal analyses contained in the minutes which were made available to them and that, because of that availability, the exchange of views within the Immigration and Naturalisation Service was recorded less frequently in the minutes, the Minister abandoned that policy.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since then, requests for the communication of minutes have been systematically refused. Instead of obtaining a copy of the minute, the applicant now receives a summary of the personal data contained in the document, including information relating to the origin of those data and, where relevant, the bodies to which they were disclosed.\n\u00a0\nCase C-141/12\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 13\u00a0January 2009, YS submitted an application for a residence permit for a fixed period under asylum law. The application was rejected by decision of 9\u00a0June 2009. That decision was withdrawn by letter of 9\u00a0April 2010, and the application was once again rejected by decision of 6\u00a0July 2010.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 10\u00a0September 2010, YS asked for the minute relating to the decision of 6\u00a0July 2010 to be communicated to him.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 24\u00a0September 2010, that was refused. However, the decision did give a summary of the data contained in the minute, the origin of those data and the bodies to which the data had been disclosed. YS lodged an objection against the refusal to communicate the minute, which itself was rejected by decision of 22\u00a0March 2011.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0YS then brought an action against that rejection decision before the Rechtbank Middelburg (District Court, Middelburg), on the ground that he could not lawfully be refused access to that minute.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Rechtbank Middelburg decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are the data reproduced in the minute concerning the data subject and which relate to the data subject personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of [Directive 95/46]?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the legal analysis included in the minute constitute personal data within the meaning of the aforementioned provision? \n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Court of Justice confirms that the data described above are personal data, should the processor/government body grant access to those personal data pursuant to Article\u00a012 of [Directive 95/46] and Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter? \n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, may the data subject rely directly on Article\u00a041(2)(b) of the Charter, and if so, must the phrase \u201cwhile respecting the legitimate interests of confidentiality [in decision-making]\u201d included therein be interpreted in such a way that the right of access to the minute may be refused on that ground? \n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the data subject requests access to the minute, should the processor/government body provide a copy of that document in order to do justice to the right of access?\u2019\n\u00a0\nCase C-372/12\n\u00a0The dispute concerning M\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 28\u00a0October 2009, the Minister granted M a residence permit for a fixed period as asylum seeker on the basis of Article\u00a029(1)(b) of the Vw 2000. The reasons for that decision were not given, in that it did not set out the manner in which the case had been assessed by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 30\u00a0October 2009, M, on the basis of Article\u00a035 of the Wbp, requested access to the minute relating to that decision.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 4\u00a0November 2009, the Minister refused M access to the minute. He based the refusal on Article\u00a043(e) of the Wbp, since he was of the view that access to such a document was liable adversely to affect the freedom of the case worker responsible for compiling it to include certain arguments and considerations in the minute which could be relevant in the decision-making process.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The objection to that refusal having been rejected by decision of 3\u00a0December 2010, M brought an action against that decision before the Rechtbank Middelburg. By decision of 16\u00a0June 2011, that court took the view that the interest relied on by the Minister to refuse access to the minute did not amount to an interest protected by Article\u00a043(e) of the Wbp, and annulled the Minister\u2019s decision as being based on reasoning that was wrong in law. It also found that there was no reason to maintain the legal effects of the decision, since the Minister, contrary to Article\u00a035(2) of the Wbp, had not given access to the legal analysis in the minute from which it might have become evident why M could not be considered to be a refugee for the purposes of Article\u00a029(1)(a) of the Vw 2000.\n\u00a0The dispute concerning S\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 10\u00a0February 2010, which did not state reasons, the Minister granted S an ordinary residence permit for a fixed period on the ground of \u2018dramatic circumstances\u2019. By letter of 19\u00a0February 2010, S, on the basis of Article\u00a035 of the Wbp, requested the minute relating to that decision.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The request was rejected by decision of 31\u00a0March 2010, which was confirmed by decision of 21\u00a0October 2010 following an objection. In the decision of 21\u00a0October 2010, the Minister took the position that the decision of 31\u00a0March 2010 had already stated which personal data were included in the minute and that the request for access to the minute had thus been met. Furthermore, he was of the opinion that the Wbp does not confer any rights of access to the minute.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 4\u00a0August 2011, the Rechtbank Amsterdam (District Court, Amsterdam) declared well-founded the action brought by S against the decision of 21\u00a0October 2010 and annulled that decision. That court found, inter alia, that the minute in question did not contain any information other than personal data of S, that he had a right of access to those data under the Wbp, and that the Minister\u2019s refusal to allow access was not validly based.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Minister decided to appeal to the Raad van State (Council of State) both in the dispute concerning M and in that concerning S.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Raad van State decided to join the cases concerning M and S, to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u20181. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should the second indent of Article\u00a012(a) of [Directive 95/46] be interpreted to mean that there is a right to a copy of documents in which personal data have been processed, or is it sufficient if a full summary, in an intelligible form, of the personal data that have undergone processing in the documents concerned is provided?\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should the words \u201cright of access\u201d in Article\u00a08(2) of [the Charter] be interpreted to mean that there is a right to a copy of documents in which personal data have been processed, or is it sufficient if there is provision of a full summary, in an intelligible form, of the personal data that have undergone processing in the documents concerned within the meaning of the second indent of Article\u00a012(a) of [Directive 95/46]?\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Article\u00a041(2)(b) of [the Charter] also addressed to the Member States of the European Union in so far as they are implementing EU law within the meaning of Article\u00a051(1) of that Charter?\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the consequence that, as a result of the granting of access to \u201cminutes\u201d, the reasons why a particular decision is proposed are no longer recorded therein, which is not in the interests of the internal undisturbed exchange of views within the public authority concerned and of orderly decision-making, constitute a legitimate interest of confidentiality within the meaning of Article\u00a041(2)(b) of [the Charter]?\n5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can a legal analysis, as set out in a \u201cminute\u201d, be regarded as personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of [Directive 95/46]?\n6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, within the meaning of Article\u00a013(1)(g) of [Directive 95/46] \u2026, also cover the interest in an internal undisturbed exchange of views within the public authority concerned? If the answer to that is in the negative, can that interest then be covered by Article\u00a013(1)(d) or (f) of that directive?\u2019\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By decision of 30\u00a0April 2013, Cases C-141/12 and C-372/12 were joined for the purposes of the oral procedure and of the judgment.\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first and second questions in Case C-141/12 and the fifth question in Case C-372/12, concerning the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the first and second questions in Case C-141/12 and the fifth question in Case C-372/12, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring courts ask, in essence, whether Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the data relating to the applicant for a residence permit and the legal analysis included in the minute are \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of that provision.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although all interested parties who adopted a view on this point consider that the data relating to the applicant for a residence permit included in the minute correspond to the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 and propose, consequently, that a positive reply be given to the first question in Case C-141/12, opinions differ in relation to the legal analysis in that administrative document, which is the subject of the second question in that case and the fifth question in Case C-372/12.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0YS, M and S, the Greek, Austrian and Portuguese Governments and the European Commission consider that, in so far as the legal analysis refers to a specific natural person and is based on the situation and that person\u2019s individual characteristics, it also comes under the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019. The Greek Government and the Commission state, however, that that applies solely to legal analyses which contain information concerning an individual and not to those which contain only an abstract legal interpretation, while M and S consider that even such an abstract interpretation falls within the scope of that provision if it is decisive for the assessment of the application for a residence permit and is applied to the specific case of the applicant.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, according to the Netherlands, Czech and French Governments, the legal analysis in a minute does not come under the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it should be noted that Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 defines personal data as \u2018any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019.\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no doubt that the data relating to the applicant for a residence permit and contained in a minute, such as the applicant\u2019s name, date of birth, nationality, gender, ethnicity, religion and language, are information relating to that natural person, who is identified in that minute in particular by his name, and must consequently be considered to be \u2018personal data\u2019 (see, to that effect, inter alia the judgment in \nHuber\n, C-524/06, EU:C:2008:724, paragraphs\u00a031 and 43).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, on the other hand, the legal analysis in a minute, it must be stated that, although it may contain personal data, it does not in itself constitute such data within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General noted in essence in point\u00a059 of her Opinion, and as the Netherlands, Czech and French Governments noted, such a legal analysis is not information relating to the applicant for a residence permit, but at most, in so far as it is not limited to a purely abstract interpretation of the law, is information about the assessment and application by the competent authority of that law to the applicant\u2019s situation, that situation being established inter alia by means of the personal data relating to him which that authority has available to it.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation of the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 for the purposes of Directive 95/46 not only follows from the wording of Article\u00a02(a) but is also borne out by the objective and general scheme of that directive.\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a01 of that directive, its purpose is to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data, and thus to permit the free flow of personal data between Member States.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to recital 25 in the preamble to Directive 95/46, the principles of protection of natural persons provided therein are reflected, on the one hand, in the obligations imposed on those responsible for processing data concerning those persons and, on the other hand, in the rights conferred on individuals, the data on whom are the subject of processing, to be informed that processing is taking place, to consult the data, to request corrections and even to object to processing in certain circumstances.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards those rights of the data subject, referred to in Directive 95/46, it must be noted that the protection of the fundamental right to respect for private life means, inter alia, that that person may be certain that the personal data concerning him are correct and that they are processed in a lawful manner. As is apparent from recital 41 in the preamble to that directive, it is in order to carry out the necessary checks that the data subject has, under Article\u00a012(a) of the directive, a right of access to the data relating to him which are being processed. That right of access is necessary, inter alia, to enable the data subject to obtain, depending on the circumstances, the rectification, erasure or blocking of his data by the controller and consequently to exercise the right set out in Article\u00a012(b) of that directive (see, to that effect, the judgment in \nRijkeboer\n, C-553/07, EU:C:2009:293, paragraphs\u00a049 and 51).\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In contrast to the data relating to the applicant for a residence permit which is in the minute and which may constitute the factual basis of the legal analysis contained therein, such an analysis, as the Netherlands and French Governments have noted, is not in itself liable to be the subject of a check of its accuracy by that applicant and a rectification under Article\u00a012(b) of Directive 95/46.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, extending the right of access of the applicant for a residence permit to that legal analysis would not in fact serve the directive\u2019s purpose of guaranteeing the protection of the applicant\u2019s right to privacy with regard to the processing of data relating to him, but would serve the purpose of guaranteeing him a right of access to administrative documents, which is not however covered by Directive 95/46.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In an analogous context, as regards the processing of personal data by the EU institutions, governed on the one hand by Regulation (EC) No\u00a045/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18\u00a0December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (OJ 2001 L\u00a08, p.\u00a01), and on the other by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30\u00a0May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (OJ 2001 L\u00a0145, p.\u00a043), the Court has previously held, in paragraph\u00a049 of the judgment in \nCommission \nv\n Bavarian Lager\n, C-28/08\u00a0P, EU:C:2010:378, that those regulations have different objectives and that, in contrast to Regulation No\u00a01049/2001, Regulation No\u00a045/2001 is not designed to ensure the greatest possible transparency of the decision-making process of the public authorities and to promote good administrative practices by facilitating the exercise of the right of access to documents. That finding applies equally to Directive 95/46, which, in essence, has the same objective as Regulation No\u00a045/2001.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the answer to the first and second questions in Case C-141/12 and the fifth question in Case C-372/12 is that Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the data relating to the applicant for a residence permit contained in the minute and, where relevant, the data in the legal analysis contained in the minute are \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of that provision, whereas, by contrast, that analysis cannot in itself be so classified.\n\u00a0\nThe sixth question in Case C-372/12, concerning the possibility of limiting the right of access\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the answer given to the first and second questions in Case C-141/12 and to the fifth question in Case C-372/12, and since the referring court specified that the sixth question raised in Case C-372/12 requires an answer only if the legal analysis in the minute must be classified as personal data, there is no need to answer that sixth question.\n\u00a0\nThe third and fifth questions in Case C-141/12 and the first and second questions in Case C-372/12, concerning the scope of the right of access\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the third and fifth questions in Case C-141/12 and by the first and second questions in Case C-372/12, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring courts ask, in essence, whether Article\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter must be interpreted as meaning that the applicant for a residence permit has a right of access to data concerning him which are in the minute and, if so, whether that right to access implies that the competent authorities must provide him with a copy of that minute or whether it is sufficient for them to send him a full summary of those data in an intelligible form.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the parties to the proceedings before the Court agree that Article\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46 grants an applicant for a residence permit a right of access to all the personal data contained in the minute, although their views as regards the actual extent of that right differ according to their interpretation of the concept of \u2018personal data\u2019.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the form that that access must take, YS, M and S and the Greek Government consider that the applicant has the right to obtain a copy of the minute. They maintain that only such a copy would allow him to ensure that he is in possession of all the personal data which concern him in the minute.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, according to the Netherlands, Czech, French and Portuguese Governments and the Commission, neither Article\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46 nor Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter requires Member States to provide a copy of the minute to the applicant for a residence permit. Thus, there are other possible ways of disclosing, in an intelligible form, the personal data contained in such a document, inter alia by providing him with a full and comprehensible summary of those data.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the provisions of Directive 95/46, in so far as they govern the processing of personal data liable to infringe fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to privacy, must necessarily be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights, which, according to settled case-law of the Court, form an integral part of the general principles of law whose observance the Court ensures and which are now set out in the Charter (see, inter alia, the judgments in \nConnolly \nv\n Commission\n, C-274/99\u00a0P, EU:C:2001:127, paragraph\u00a037; \n\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others\n, C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01, EU:C:2003:294, paragraph\u00a068; and \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a068).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a08 of the Charter, which guarantees the right to the protection of personal data, provides in paragraph\u00a02, inter alia, that everyone has the right of access to data which have been collected concerning him or her. That requirement is implemented by Article\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46 (see, to that effect, the judgment in \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a069).\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That provision of Directive 95/46 provides that Member States are to guarantee every data subject the right to obtain from the controller, without constraint at reasonable intervals and without excessive delay or expense, communication to him in an intelligible form of the data undergoing processing and of any available information as to their source.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Directive 95/46 requires Member States to ensure that every data subject can obtain from the controller of personal data communication of all such data processed by the controller relating to the data subject, it leaves it to the Member States to determine the actual material form that that communication must take, as long as it is \u2018intelligible\u2019, in other words it allows the data subject to become aware of those data and to check that they are accurate and processed in compliance with that directive, so that that person may, where relevant, exercise the rights conferred on him by Articles\u00a012(b) and (c), 14, 22 and 23 of the directive (see, to that effect, the judgment in \nRijkeboer\n, EU:C:2009:293, paragraphs\u00a051 and 52).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in so far as the objective pursued by that right of access may be fully satisfied by another form of communication, the data subject cannot derive from either Article\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46 or Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter the right to obtain a copy of the document or the original file in which those data appear. In order to avoid giving the data subject access to information other than the personal data relating to him, he may obtain a copy of the document or the original file in which that other information has been redacted.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In situations such as those in the main proceedings, it follows from the answer given in paragraph\u00a048 above that only the data relating to the applicant for a residence permit contained in the minute and, where relevant, the data in the legal analysis contained in the minute are \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46. Consequently the right of access which that applicant may rely on under Article\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter relates solely to those data. For that right of access to be complied with, it is sufficient for the applicant for a residence permit to be provided with a full summary of all of those data in an intelligible form, that is, a form which allows him to become aware of those data and to check that they are accurate and processed in compliance with that directive, so that he may, where relevant, exercise the rights conferred on him by Articles\u00a012(b) and (c), 14, 22 and 23 of that directive.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing considerations that the answer to the third and fifth questions in Case C-141/12 and the first and second questions in Case C-372/12 is that Article\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter must be interpreted as meaning that an applicant for a residence permit has a right of access to all personal data concerning him which are processed by the national administrative authorities within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) of that directive. For that right to be complied with, it is sufficient for the applicant to be provided with a full summary of those data in an intelligible form, that is, a form which allows him to become aware of those data and to check that they are accurate and processed in compliance with that directive, so that he may, where relevant, exercise the rights conferred on him by that directive.\n\u00a0\nThe fourth question in Case C-141/12 and the third and fourth questions in Case C-372/12, concerning Article\u00a041 of the Charter\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the fourth question in Case C-141/12 and the third and fourth questions in Case C-372/12, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring courts ask, in essence, whether Article\u00a041(2)(b) of the Charter must be interpreted as meaning that the applicant for a residence permit may rely against national authorities on the right of access to the file provided for in that provision and, if so, what is the scope of the phrase \u2018while respecting the legitimate interests of confidentiality\u2019 in decision-making within the meaning of that provision.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission considers that those questions are inadmissible on account of their hypothetical and obscure wording.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law of the Court, questions on the interpretation of EU law referred by a national court in the factual and legislative context which that court is responsible for defining, and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court to determine, enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (see, inter alia, the judgment in \nM\u00e1rquez Samohano\n, C-190/13, EU:C:2014:146, paragraph\u00a035 and the case-law cited).\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, that is not so in the present case. In the light of the factual context outlined by the referring courts, it does not appear that the question of whether the applicants in the main proceedings may, pursuant to Article\u00a041(2)(b) of the Charter, rely on a right of access to the file concerning their applications for a residence permit is of a purely hypothetical nature. The wording of the questions and the information concerning them in the orders for reference are, furthermore, sufficiently clear to determine the scope of those questions and to enable, first, the Court to answer them and, secondly, the interested parties to submit their observations pursuant to Article\u00a023 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the substance of the questions referred, YS, M and S as well as the Greek Government consider that the applicant for a resident permit may take Article\u00a041(2)(b) of the Charter as a basis for a right of access to the file, given that, in the context of the procedure for granting such a permit, the national authorities apply the asylum directives. By contrast, the Netherlands, Czech, French, Austrian and Portuguese Governments and the Commission consider that Article\u00a041 of the Charter is directed exclusively at the EU institutions and cannot, therefore, establish a right of access to a file in the context of a national procedure.\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted from the outset that Article\u00a041 of the Charter, \u2018Right to good administration\u2019, states in paragraph\u00a01 that every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the European Union. Article\u00a041(2) specifies that that right includes the right of every person to have access to his or her file, while respecting the legitimate interests of confidentiality and of professional and business secrecy.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from the wording of Article\u00a041 of the Charter that it is addressed not to the Member States but solely to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the European Union (see, to that effect, the judgment in \nCicala\n, C-482/10, EU:C:2011:868, paragraph\u00a028). Consequently, an applicant for a resident permit cannot derive from Article\u00a041(2)(b) of the Charter a right to access the national file relating to his application.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that the right to good administration, enshrined in that provision, reflects a general principle of EU law (judgment in \nHN\n, C-604/12, EU:C:2014:302, paragraph\u00a049). However, by their questions in the present cases, the referring courts are not seeking an interpretation of that general principle, but ask whether Article\u00a041 of the Charter may, in itself, apply to the Member States of the European Union.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the answer to the fourth question in Case C-141/12 and the third and fourth questions in Case C-372/12 is that Article\u00a041(2)(b) of the Charter must be interpreted as meaning that the applicant for a residence permit cannot rely on that provision against the national authorities.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as meaning that the data relating to an applicant for a residence permit contained in an administrative document, such as the \u2018minute\u2019 at issue in the main proceedings, setting out the grounds that the case officer puts forward in support of the draft decision which he is responsible for drawing up in the context of the procedure prior to the adoption of a decision concerning the application for such a permit and, where relevant, the data in the legal analysis contained in that document, are \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of that provision, whereas, by contrast, that analysis cannot in itself be so classified.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a012(a) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a08(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be interpreted as meaning that an applicant for a residence permit has a right of access to all personal data concerning him which are processed by the national administrative authorities within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) of that directive. For that right to be complied with, it is sufficient that the applicant be in possession of a full summary of those data in an intelligible form, that is to say a form which allows that applicant to become aware of those data and to check that they are accurate and processed in compliance with that directive, so that he may, where relevant, exercise the rights conferred on him by that directive.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a041(2)(b) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be interpreted as meaning that the applicant for a residence permit cannot rely on that provision against the national authorities."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

Considering that Weltimmo had infringed the Law on information, that data protection authority imposed on that company a fine of HUF 10 million (approximately EUR\u00a032\u00a0000).\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Weltimmo then brought an action before the Budapest administrative and labour court (F\u0151v\u00e1rosi K\u00f6zigazgat\u00e1si \u00e9s Munka\u00fcgyi B\u00edr\u00f3s\u00e1g), which held that the fact that that company did not have a registered office or branch in Hungary was not a valid argument in defence because the processing of data and the supply of data services relating to the Hungarian property concerned had taken place in Hungary. However, that court set aside the decision of the Hungarian data protection authority on other grounds, connected with the lack of clarity over some of the facts. \n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Weltimmo appealed on a point of law to the referring court, claiming that there was no need for further clarification of the facts, since, pursuant to Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, the Hungarian data protection authority in this case was not competent and could not apply Hungarian law in respect of a supplier of services established in another Member State. Weltimmo maintained that, under Article\u00a028(6) of Directive 95/46, that authority should have asked the Slovak data protection authority to act in its place.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Hungarian data protection authority submitted that Weltimmo had a Hungarian representative in Hungary, namely one of the owners of that company, who represented it in the administrative and judicial proceedings that took place in that Member State. That authority added that Weltimmo\u2019s Internet servers were probably installed in Germany or in Austria, but that the owners of that company lived in Hungary. Lastly, according to that authority, it follows from Article\u00a028(6) of Directive 95/46 that it was in any event competent to act, regardless of the applicable law.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since it had doubts concerning the determination of the applicable law and the powers of the Hungarian data protection authority under Articles\u00a04(1) and 28 of Directive 95/46, the K\u00faria (Supreme Court, Hungary) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can Article\u00a028(1) of Directive 95/46 be interpreted as meaning that the provisions of national law of a Member State are applicable in its territory to a situation where a data controller runs a property dealing website established only in another Member State and also advertises properties situated in the territory of that first Member State and the property owners have forwarded their personal data to a facility (server) for data storage and data processing belonging to the operator of the website in that other Member State?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can Article\u00a04(1)(a) of [Directive 95/46], read in conjunction with recitals 18 to 20 of its preamble and Articles\u00a01(2) and 28(1) thereof, be interpreted as meaning that the Hungarian [data protection authority] may not apply the Hungarian law on data protection, as national law, to an operator of a property dealing website established only in another Member State, even if it also advertises Hungarian property whose owners transfer the data relating to such property probably from Hungarian territory to a facility (server) for data storage and data processing belonging to the operator of the website?\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it significant for the purposes of interpretation that the service provided by the data controller who operates the website is directed at the territory of another Member State?\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it significant for the purposes of interpretation that the data relating to the properties in the other Member State and the personal data of the owners are uploaded in fact from the territory of that other Member State?\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it significant for the purposes of interpretation that the personal data relating to those properties are the personal data of citizens of another Member State?\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it significant for the purposes of interpretation that the owners of the undertaking established in Slovakia live in Hungary?\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If it appears from the answers to the above questions that the Hungarian data protection authority may act but must apply the law of the Member State of establishment and may not apply national law, must Article\u00a028(6) of [Directive 95/46] be interpreted as meaning that the Hungarian data protection authority may only exercise the powers provided for by Article\u00a028(3) of [Directive 95/46] in accordance with the provisions of the legislation of the Member State of establishment and accordingly may not impose a fine?\n(8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May the term \u201cadatfeldolgoz\u00e1s\u201d (technical manipulation of data) used in both Article\u00a04(1)(a) and in Article\u00a028(6) of the [Hungarian version of Directive 95/46 to translate \u2018data processing\u2019] be considered to be equivalent to the usual term for data processing, \u201cadatkezel\u00e9s\u201d, used in connection with that directive?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred \n\u00a0\nPreliminary observations\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, first of all, the factual context of the main proceedings, certain additional information, which was submitted by the Hungarian data protection authority in its written observations and at the hearing before the Court, should be mentioned.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from that information, first, that that authority informally learned from its Slovak counterpart that Weltimmo did not carry out any activity at the place where it has its registered office, in Slovakia. Moreover, on several occasions, Weltimmo moved that registered office from one State to another. Secondly, Weltimmo developed two property dealing websites, written exclusively in Hungarian. It opened a bank account in Hungary, which was intended for the recovery of its debts, and had a letter box in that Member State for its everyday business affairs. The post was regularly picked up and sent to Weltimmo by electronic means. Thirdly, the advertisers themselves not only had to enter the data relating to their properties on Weltimmo\u2019s website, but also had to delete those data from that website if they did not want those data to continue to appear on the website after the end of the one-month period mentioned above. Weltimmo raised a computer management issue in order to explain why it had not been possible to carry out that erasure. Fourthly, Weltimmo is a company made up of only one or two persons. Its representative in Hungary tried to negotiate the settlement of the unpaid debts with the advertisers. \n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards, next, the wording of the questions referred, although the referring court uses the words \u2018established only\u2019 in its first and second questions, it is apparent from the order for reference and the written and oral observations submitted by the Hungarian data protection authority that, whilst Weltimmo is registered in Slovakia and is therefore established in that Member State, within the meaning of company law, there is uncertainty as to whether it is \u2018established\u2019 only in that Member State, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46. By referring a question to the Court regarding the interpretation of that provision, the referring court seeks to ascertain what is covered by the concept of \u2018establishment\u2019 used in that provision.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, it must be observed that, in the first and second questions, the referring court mentions that the server used by Weltimmo is installed in Slovakia, whereas, in another passage in the order for reference, it mentions the possibility that that company\u2019s servers may be in Germany or in Austria. In those circumstances, it seems appropriate to consider that the question as to the Member State in which the server or servers used by that company are installed is not settled. \n\u00a0\nThe first to sixth questions\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first to sixth questions, which should be examined together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Articles\u00a04(1)(a) and 28(1) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as permitting, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, the data protection authority of a Member State to apply its national law on data protection with regard to a data controller whose company is registered in another Member State and who runs a property dealing website concerning properties situated in the territory of the first of those two States. In particular, the referring court asks whether it is significant that that Member State is the Member State: \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0at which the activity of the controller of the personal data is directed, \n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0where the properties concerned are situated,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from which the data of the owners of those properties are forwarded,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of which those owners are nationals, and\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in which the owners of that company live.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the applicable law, the referring court refers in particular to Slovak and Hungarian law, Slovak law being the law of the Member State in which the controller of the personal data concerned is registered and Hungarian law being the law of the Member State mentioned by the websites at issue in the main proceedings, in the territory of which the properties forming the subject-matter of the published advertisements are situated.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that Article\u00a04 of Directive 95/46, entitled \u2018National law applicable\u2019, which is found in the first Chapter of that directive, entitled \u2018General provisions\u2019, specifically governs the question raised. \n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, entitled \u2018Supervisory authority\u2019, deals with the role and powers of that authority. Pursuant to Article\u00a028(1) of Directive 95/46, that authority is responsible for monitoring the application, within the territory of its own Member State, of the provisions adopted by the Member States pursuant to that directive. In accordance with Article\u00a028(6) of that directive, the supervisory authority exercises the powers conferred on it, whatever the national law applicable to the processing of personal data.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national law applicable to the controller in respect of that processing must therefore be determined not in the light of Article\u00a028 of Directive 95/46, but in the light of Article\u00a04 of that directive.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As set out in Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, each Member State is to apply the national provisions it adopts pursuant to that directive to the processing of personal data where the processing is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of the Member State.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the objective pursued by Directive 95/46, consisting in ensuring effective and complete protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data, the words \u2018in the context of the activities of an establishment\u2019 cannot be interpreted restrictively (see, to that effect, judgment in \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a053).\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to achieve that objective and to ensure that individuals are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under that directive, recital 18 in the preamble to that directive states that any processing of personal data in the European Union must be carried out in accordance with the law of one of the Member States and that processing carried out under the responsibility of a controller who is established in a Member State should be governed by the law of that State. \n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The EU legislature thus prescribed a particularly broad territorial scope of Directive 95/46, which it registered in Article\u00a04 thereof (see, to that effect, judgment in \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a054).\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard, in the first place, to the concept of \u2018establishment\u2019, it should be noted that recital 19 in the preamble to Directive 95/46 states that establishment on the territory of a Member State implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements and that the legal form of such an establishment, whether simply a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor (judgment in \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a048). Moreover, that recital states that, when a single controller is established on the territory of several Member States, he must ensure, in order to avoid any circumvention of national rules, that each of the establishments fulfils the obligations imposed by the national law applicable to its activities.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in points\u00a028 and 32 to 34 of his Opinion, this results in a flexible definition of the concept of \u2018establishment\u2019, which departs from a formalistic approach whereby undertakings are established solely in the place where they are registered. Accordingly, in order to establish whether a company, the data controller, has an establishment, within the meaning of Directive 95/46, in a Member State other than the Member State or third country where it is registered, both the degree of stability of the arrangements and the effective exercise of activities in that other Member State must be interpreted in the light of the specific nature of the economic activities and the provision of services concerned. This is particularly true for undertakings offering services exclusively over the Internet. \n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it must, in particular, be held, in the light of the objective pursued by that directive, consisting in ensuring effective and complete protection of the right to privacy and in avoiding any circumvention of national rules, that the presence of only one representative can, in some circumstances, suffice to constitute a stable arrangement if that representative acts with a sufficient degree of stability through the presence of the necessary equipment for provision of the specific services concerned in the Member State in question. \n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, in order to attain that objective, it should be considered that the concept of \u2018establishment\u2019, within the meaning of Directive 95/46, extends to any real and effective activity\u00a0\u2014 even a minimal one\u00a0\u2014 exercised through stable arrangements.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the activity exercised by Weltimmo consists, at the very least, of the running of one or several property dealing websites concerning properties situated in Hungary, which are written in Hungarian and whose advertisements are subject to a fee after a period of one month. It must therefore be held that that company pursues a real and effective activity in Hungary. \n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it is apparent in particular from the information provided by the Hungarian data protection authority that Weltimmo has a representative in Hungary, who is mentioned in the Slovak companies register with an address in Hungary and who has sought to negotiate the settlement of the unpaid debts with the advertisers. That representative served as a point of contact between that company and the data subjects who lodged complaints and represented the company in the administrative and judicial proceedings. In addition, that company has opened a bank account in Hungary, intended for the recovery of its debts, and uses a letter box in that Member State for the management of its everyday business affairs. That information, which it is for the referring court to verify, is capable of establishing, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the existence of an \u2018establishment\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46. \n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it is necessary to establish whether the processing of personal data at issue is carried out \u2018in the context of the activities\u2019 of that establishment. \n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already held that Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 requires the processing of personal data in question to be carried out not \u2018by\u2019 the establishment concerned itself, but only \u2018in the context of the activities\u2019 of the establishment (judgment in \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a052).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the processing at issue in the main proceedings consists, inter alia, of the publication, on Weltimmo\u2019s property dealing websites, of personal data relating to the owners of those properties and, in some circumstances, of the use of those data for the purpose of the invoicing of the advertisements after a period of one month. \n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it should be observed that, as regards in particular the Internet, the Court has already had occasion to state that the operation of loading personal data on an Internet page must be considered to be \u2018processing\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 (judgments in \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a025, and \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a026).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no doubt that that processing takes place in the context of the activities, as described in paragraph\u00a032 of this judgment, which Weltimmo pursues in Hungary.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, subject to the checks referred to in paragraph\u00a033 of this judgment, which it is for the referring court to carry out for the purpose of establishing, should that be the case, the existence of an establishment of the controller in Hungary, it must be held that that processing is carried out in the context of the activities of that establishment and that Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 permits, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the application of the Hungarian law on the protection of personal data. \n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, the fact that the owners of the properties forming the subject-matter of the advertisements have Hungarian nationality is of no relevance whatsoever for the purposes of determining the national law applicable to the processing of the data at issue in the main proceedings.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first to sixth questions is as follows:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as permitting the application of the law on the protection of personal data of a Member State other than the Member State in which the controller with respect to the processing of those data is registered, in so far as that controller exercises, through stable arrangements in the territory of that Member State, a real and effective activity\u00a0\u2014 even a minimal one\u00a0\u2014 in the context of which that processing is carried out;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in order to ascertain, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, whether that is the case, the referring court may, in particular, take account of the fact (i) that the activity of the controller in respect of that processing, in the context of which that processing takes place, consists of the running of property dealing websites concerning properties situated in the territory of that Member State and written in that Member State\u2019s language and that it is, as a consequence, mainly or entirely directed at that Member State, and (ii) that that controller has a representative in that Member State, who is responsible for recovering the debts resulting from that activity and for representing the controller in the administrative and judicial proceedings relating to the processing of the data concerned;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by contrast, the issue of the nationality of the persons concerned by such data processing is irrelevant. \n\u00a0\nThe seventh question\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The seventh question is asked only in the event that the Hungarian data protection authority should consider that Weltimmo has, not in Hungary but in another Member State, an establishment, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, performing activities in the context of which the processing of the personal data concerned is carried out.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By that question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether, should the Hungarian data protection authority reach the conclusion that the law applicable to the processing of the personal data is not Hungarian law, but the law of another Member State, Article\u00a028(1), (3) and (6) of Directive 95/46 should be interpreted as meaning that that authority would be able to exercise only the powers provided for by Article\u00a028(3) of that directive, in accordance with the law of that other Member State, and would not be able to impose penalties.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard, in the first place, to the competence of a supervisory authority to act in such a case, it must be observed that, under Article\u00a028(4) of Directive 95/46, each supervisory authority is to hear claims lodged by any person concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal data.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the Hungarian data protection authority may hear claims lodged by persons, such as the advertisers of properties at issue in the main proceedings, who consider themselves victims of unlawful processing of their personal data in the Member State in which they hold those properties. \n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, it is necessary to examine what are the powers of that supervisory authority, in the light of Article\u00a028(1), (3) and (6) of Directive 95/46.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from Article\u00a028(1) of that directive that each supervisory authority established by a Member State is to ensure compliance, within the territory of that Member State, with the provisions adopted by the Member States pursuant to Directive 95/46.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Article\u00a028(3) of Directive 95/46, those supervisory authorities are in particular to be endowed with investigative powers, such as powers to collect all the information necessary for the performance of their supervisory duties, and effective powers of intervention, such as powers of ordering the blocking, erasure or destruction of data, of imposing a temporary or definitive ban on processing, or of warning or admonishing the data controller. \n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of the non-exhaustive nature of the powers thus listed and the type of powers of intervention mentioned in that provision, as well as the discretion available to the Member States in transposing Directive 95/46, it should be considered that those powers of intervention may include the power to penalise the data controller by imposing on him, where appropriate, a fine.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The powers granted to the supervisory authorities must be exercised in accordance with the procedural law of the Member State to which they belong.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from Article\u00a028(1) and (3) of Directive 95/46 that each supervisory authority is to exercise all of the powers conferred on it on the territory of its own Member State in order to ensure, on that territory, compliance with data protection rules.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That territorial application of the powers of each supervisory authority is confirmed in Article\u00a028(6) of the directive, which states that each supervisory authority is competent, whatever the national law applicable, to exercise, on the territory of its own Member State, the powers conferred on it in accordance with Article\u00a028(3) of that directive. Article\u00a028(6) of the directive also states that each authority may be requested to exercise its powers by an authority of another Member State and that the supervisory authorities are to cooperate with one another to the extent necessary for the performance of their duties, in particular by exchanging all useful information.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That provision is necessary in order to ensure the free flow of personal data in the European Union, whilst ensuring compliance with the rules aimed at protecting the privacy of natural persons laid down in Directive 95/46. In the absence of that provision, where the controller of personal data is subject to the law of a Member State, but infringes the right to the protection of the privacy of natural persons in another Member State, in particular by directing his activity at that other Member State without, however, being established there within the meaning of that directive, it would be difficult, or even impossible, for those persons to enforce their right to that protection. \n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It thus follows from Article\u00a028(6) of Directive 95/46 that the supervisory authority of a Member State, to which a complaint has been submitted, on the basis of Article\u00a028(4) of that directive, by natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data, may examine that complaint irrespective of the applicable law, and, consequently, even if the law applicable to the processing of the data concerned is that of another Member State.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in that case, the powers of that authority do not necessarily include all of the powers conferred on it in accordance with the law of its own Member State. \n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observed in point\u00a050 of his Opinion, it follows from the requirements derived from the territorial sovereignty of the Member State concerned, the principle of legality and the concept of the rule of law that the exercise of the power to impose penalties cannot take place, as a matter of principle, outside the legal limits within which an administrative authority is authorised to act subject to the law of its own Member State. \n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, when a supervisory authority receives a complaint, in accordance with Article\u00a028(4) of Directive 95/46, that authority may exercise its investigative powers irrespective of the applicable law and before even knowing which national law is applicable to the processing in question. However, if it reaches the conclusion that the law of another Member State is applicable, it cannot impose penalties outside the territory of its own Member State. In such a situation, it must, in fulfilment of the duty of cooperation laid down in Article\u00a028(6) of that directive, request the supervisory authority of that other Member State to establish an infringement of that law and to impose penalties if that law permits, based, where necessary, on the information which the authority of the first Member State has transmitted to the authority of that other Member State.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The supervisory authority to which such a complaint has been submitted may, in the context of that cooperation, find it necessary to carry out other investigations, on the instructions of the supervisory authority of the other Member State. \n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, if the applicable law is that of a Member State other than Hungary, the Hungarian data protection authority will not be able to exercise the powers to impose penalties which Hungarian law has conferred on it.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing considerations that the answer to the seventh question is that, where the supervisory authority of a Member State, to which complaints have been submitted in accordance with Article\u00a028(4) of Directive 95/46, reaches the conclusion that the law applicable to the processing of the personal data concerned is not the law of that Member State, but the law of another Member State, Article\u00a028(1), (3) and (6) of that directive must be interpreted as meaning that that supervisory authority will be able to exercise the effective powers of intervention conferred on it in accordance with Article\u00a028(3) of that directive only within the territory of its own Member State. Accordingly, it cannot impose penalties on the basis of the law of that Member State on the controller with respect to the processing of those data who is not established in that territory, but should, in accordance with Article\u00a028(6) of that directive, request the supervisory authority within the Member State whose law is applicable to act. \n\u00a0\nThe eighth question\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its eighth question, the referring court seeks an interpretation from the Court of the scope of the term \u2018adatfeldolgoz\u00e1s\u2019 (technical manipulation of data) used in particular in Article\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, relating to the determination of the applicable law, and in Article\u00a028(6) of that directive, relating to the competence of the supervisory authority.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is apparent from Directive 95/46, in the Hungarian version thereof, that that version consistently uses the term \u2018adatfeldolgoz\u00e1s\u2019.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states that, in particular in its provisions designed to implement the provisions of Directive 95/46 relating to the competence of the supervisory authorities, the Law on information uses the term \u2018adatkezel\u00e9s\u2019 (data processing). However, as is apparent from Paragraph\u00a03(10) of that law, that term has a broader meaning than that of the term \u2018adatfeldolgoz\u00e1s\u2019, defined in Paragraph\u00a03(17) of that law, and encompasses the latter term. \n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whilst, according to its usual meaning and as is apparent from the Law on information, the term \u2018adatfeldolgoz\u00e1s\u2019 has a narrower meaning than the term \u2018adatkezel\u00e9s\u2019, it must however be observed that the Hungarian version of Directive 95/46 defines the term \u2018adatfeldolgoz\u00e1s\u2019 in Article\u00a02(b) thereof in a broad manner, corresponding to the term \u2018adatkezel\u00e9s\u2019. \n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the answer to the eighth question is that Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the term \u2018adatfeldolgoz\u00e1s\u2019 (technical manipulation of data), used in the Hungarian version of that directive, in particular in Articles\u00a04(1)(a) and 28(6) thereof, must be understood as having the same meaning as that of the term \u2018adatkezel\u00e9s\u2019 (data processing).\n\u00a0\nCosts\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a04(1)(a) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as permitting the application of the law on the protection of personal data of a Member State other than the Member State in which the controller with respect to the processing of those data is registered, in so far as that controller exercises, through stable arrangements in the territory of that Member State, a real and effective activity\u00a0\u2014 even a minimal one\u00a0\u2014 in the context of which that processing is carried out.\nIn order to ascertain, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, whether that is the case, the referring court may, in particular, take account of the fact (i) that the activity of the controller in respect of that processing, in the context of which that processing takes place, consists of the running of property dealing websites concerning properties situated in the territory of that Member State and written in that Member State\u2019s language and that it is, as a consequence, mainly or entirely directed at that Member State, and (ii) that that controller has a representative in that Member State, who is responsible for recovering the debts resulting from that activity and for representing the controller in the administrative and judicial proceedings relating to the processing of the data concerned.\nBy contrast, the issue of the nationality of the persons concerned by such data processing is irrelevant.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhere the supervisory authority of a Member State, to which complaints have been submitted in accordance with Article\u00a028(4) of Directive 95/46, reaches the conclusion that the law applicable to the processing of the personal data concerned is not the law of that Member State, but the law of another Member State, Article\u00a028(1), (3) and (6) of that directive must be interpreted as meaning that that supervisory authority will be able to exercise the effective powers of intervention conferred on it in accordance with Article\u00a028(3) of that directive only within the territory of its own Member State. Accordingly, it cannot impose penalties on the basis of the law of that Member State on the controller with respect to the processing of those data who is not established in that territory, but should, in accordance with Article\u00a028(6) of that directive, request the supervisory authority within the Member State whose law is applicable to act.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDirective 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the term \u2018adatfeldolgoz\u00e1s\u2019 (technical manipulation of data), used in the Hungarian version of that directive, in particular in Articles\u00a04(1)(a) and 28(6) thereof, must be understood as having the same meaning as that of the term \u2018adatkezel\u00e9s\u2019 (data processing)."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "of 6 Oct 2020, C-623/17 (\nPrivacy International\n)\nE-privacy Directive \n >

repealing Directive 95/46/EC (OJ 2016 L\u00a0119, p.\u00a01). Article\u00a03 of that directive, entitled \u2018Scope\u2019, was worded as follows:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive shall apply to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means, and to the processing otherwise than by automatic means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive shall not apply to the processing of personal data:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI [TEU] and in any case to processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the processing operation relates to State security matters) and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law,\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity.\u2019\n\u00a0\nDirective 2002/58\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recitals\u00a02, 6, 7, 11, 22, 26 and 30 of Directive 2002/58 state:\n\u2018(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Directive seeks to respect the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by [the Charter]. In particular, this Directive seeks to ensure full respect for the rights set out in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of [the Charter].\n\u2026 \n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Internet is overturning traditional market structures by providing a common, global infrastructure for the delivery of a wide range of electronic communications services.

Therefore it does not alter the existing balance between the individual\u2019s right to privacy and the possibility for Member States to take the measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of this Directive, necessary for the protection of public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State when the activities relate to State security matters) and the enforcement of criminal law. Consequently, this Directive does not affect the ability of Member States to carry out lawful interception of electronic communications, or take other measures, if necessary for any of these purposes and in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, [signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950], as interpreted by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights. Such measures must be appropriate, strictly proportionate to the intended purpose and necessary within a democratic society and should be subject to adequate safeguards in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\u2026 \n(22)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prohibition of storage of communications and the related traffic data by persons other than the users or without their consent is not intended to prohibit any automatic, intermediate and transient storage of this information in so far as this takes place for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission in the electronic communications network and provided that the information is not stored for any period longer than is necessary for the transmission and for traffic management purposes, and that during the period of storage the confidentiality remains guaranteed. Where this is necessary for making more efficient the onward transmission of any publicly accessible information to other recipients of the service upon their request, this Directive should not prevent such information from being further stored, provided that this information would in any case be accessible to the public without restriction and that any data referring to the individual subscribers or users requesting such information are erased.\n\u2026 \n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The data relating to subscribers processed within electronic communications networks to establish connections and to transmit information contain information on the private life of natural persons and concern the right to respect for their correspondence or concern the legitimate interests of legal persons.

Any further processing of such data\u00a0\u2026 may only be allowed if the subscriber has agreed to this on the basis of accurate and full information given by the provider of the publicly available electronic communications services about the types of further processing it intends to perform and about the subscriber\u2019s right not to give or to withdraw his/her consent to such processing.

On 5\u00a0June 2015, Privacy International, a non-governmental organisation, brought an action before the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (United Kingdom) against the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Secretary of State for the Home Department and those security and intelligence agencies, challenging the lawfulness of those practices.\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court examined the lawfulness of those practices in the light, first of all, of national law and the provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950 (\u2018the ECHR\u2019), and, subsequently, of EU law. In a judgment of 17\u00a0October 2016, that court held that the defendants in the main proceedings had acknowledged that those agencies acquired and used, in their activities, sets of bulk personal data, such as biographical data or travel data, financial or commercial information, communications data liable to include sensitive data covered by professional secrecy, or journalistic material. That data, obtained by various, possibly secret, means, would be analysed by cross-checking and by automated processing and could be disclosed to other persons and authorities and shared with foreign partners. In that context, the security and intelligence agencies would also use bulk communications data, acquired from providers of public electronic communications networks under, inter alia, directions issued by a Secretary of State on the basis of section 94 of the 1984 Act. GCHQ and MI5 have been doing this since 2001 and 2005 respectively.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court found that those measures for the acquisition and use of data were consistent with national law and, since 2015, subject to issues that remained under consideration concerning the proportionality of those measures and the transfer of data to third parties, with Article\u00a08 ECHR. In that regard, it stated that evidence had been submitted to it concerning the applicable safeguards, in particular as regards the procedures for accessing and disclosing data outside the security and intelligence agencies, the arrangements for retaining data, and independent oversight arrangements.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the lawfulness of the acquisition and use measures at issue in the main proceedings in the light of EU law, the referring court examined, in a judgment of 8\u00a0September 2017, whether those measures fell within the scope of EU law and, if so, whether they were compatible with EU law. That court found, as regards bulk communications data, that the providers of electronic communications networks were required, under section 94 of the 1984 Act, should a Secretary of State issue directions to that effect, to provide the security and intelligence agencies with data collected in the course of their economic activity falling within the scope of EU law. However, that was not the case for the acquisition of other data obtained by those agencies without the use of such binding powers. On the basis of that finding, the referring court considered it necessary to refer questions to the Court in order to determine whether a regime such as that resulting from section 94 of the 1984 Act falls within the scope of EU law and, if so, whether and in what way the requirements laid down by the case-law resulting from the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 Sverige \nand\n Watson and Others\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970; \u2018\nTele2\n\u2019) apply to that regime.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, in its request for a preliminary ruling, the referring court states that, pursuant to section 94 of the 1984 Act, the Secretary of State may give providers of electronic communications services such general or specific directions as appear to him to be necessary in the interests of national security or relations with a foreign government. Referring to the definitions set out in section 21(4) and (6) of the RIPA, that court states that the data concerned includes traffic data and service use information, within the meaning of that provision, with only the content of communications being excluded. Such data and information make it possible, in particular, to know the \u2018who, where, when and how\u2019 of a communication. That data is transmitted to the security and intelligence agencies and retained by them for the purposes of their activities.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the referring court, the regime at issue in the main proceedings differs from that resulting from the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014, at issue in the case which gave rise to the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 \n(C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970), since the latter regime provided for the retention of data by providers of electronic communications services and the making available of that data not only to security and intelligence agencies, in the interests of national security, but also to other public authorities, depending on their needs. Furthermore, that judgment concerned a criminal investigation, not national security.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court adds that the databases compiled by the security and intelligence agencies are subject to bulk, unspecific, automated processing, with the aim of discovering unknown threats. To that end, the referring court states that the sets of metadata thus compiled should be as comprehensive as possible, so as to have a \u2018haystack\u2019 in order to find the \u2018needle\u2019 hidden therein. As regards the usefulness of bulk data acquisition by those agencies and the techniques for consulting that data, that court refers in particular to the findings of the report drawn up on 19\u00a0August 2016 by David Anderson QC, then United Kingdom Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, who relied, when drawing up that report, on a review conducted by a team of intelligence specialists and on the testimony of security and intelligence agency officers.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court also states that, according to Privacy International, the regime at issue in the main proceedings is unlawful in the light of EU law, while the defendants in the main proceedings consider that the obligation to transfer data provided for by that regime, access to that data and its use do not fall within the competences of the European Union, in accordance, in particular, with Article\u00a04(2) TEU, according to which national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal considers, on the basis of the judgment of 30\u00a0May 2006, \nParliament\n v \nCouncil and Commission\n (C-317/04 and C-318/04, EU:C:2006:346, paragraphs\u00a056 to 59), concerning the transfer of passenger name record data for the purpose of protecting public security, that the activities of commercial undertakings in processing and transferring data for the purpose of protecting national security do not appear to fall within the scope of EU law. For the referring court, it is necessary to examine not whether the activity in question constitutes data processing, but only whether, in substance and effect, the purpose of such activity is to advance an essential State function, within the meaning of Article\u00a04(2) TEU, through a framework established by the public authorities that relates to public security.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should the measures at issue in the main proceedings nevertheless fall within the scope of EU law, the referring court considers that the requirements set out in paragraphs\u00a0119 to 125 of the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 \n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970) appear inappropriate in the context of national security and would undermine the ability of the security and intelligence agencies to tackle some threats to national security.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018In circumstances where:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the [security and intelligence agencies\u2019] capabilities to use [bulk communications data] supplied to them are essential to the protection of the national security of the United Kingdom, including in the fields of counter-terrorism, counter-espionage and counter-nuclear proliferation;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a fundamental feature of the [security and intelligence agencies\u2019] use of [bulk communications data] is to discover previously unknown threats to national security by means of non-targeted bulk techniques which are reliant upon the aggregation of [those data] in one place. Its principal utility lies in swift target identification and development, as well as providing a basis for action in the face of imminent threat;\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the provider of an electronic communications network is not thereafter required to retain [the bulk communications data] (beyond the period of their ordinary business requirements), which [are] retained by the State (the [security and intelligence agencies]) alone;\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the national court has found (subject to certain reserved issues) that the safeguards surrounding the use of [bulk communications data] by the [security and intelligence agencies] are consistent with the requirements of the ECHR; and\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the national court has found that the imposition of the requirements specified in [paragraphs\u00a0119 to 125 of the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2 \n(C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970)], if applicable, would frustrate the measures taken to safeguard national security by the [security and intelligence agencies], and thereby put the national security of the United Kingdom at risk;\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to Article\u00a04 TEU and Article\u00a01(3) of [Directive 2002/58], does a requirement in a direction by a Secretary of State to a provider of an electronic communications network that it must provide bulk communications data to the [security and intelligence agencies] of a Member State fall within the scope of Union law and of [Directive 2002/58]?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the answer to Question (1) is \u201cyes\u201d, do any of the [requirements applicable to retained communications data, set out in paragraphs\u00a0119 to 125 of the judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n (C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970)] or any other requirements in addition to those imposed by the ECHR, apply to such a direction by a Secretary of State? And, if so, how and to what extent do those requirements apply, taking into account the essential necessity of the [security and intelligence agencies] to use bulk acquisition and automated processing techniques to protect national security and the extent to which such capabilities, if otherwise compliant with the ECHR, may be critically impeded by the imposition of such requirements?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nQuestion\u00a01\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Article\u00a04(2) TEU, is to be interpreted as meaning that national legislation enabling a State authority to require providers of electronic communications services to forward traffic data and location data to the security and intelligence agencies for the purpose of safeguarding national security falls within the scope of that directive.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Privacy International argues, in essence, that, having regard to the guidance derived from the case-law of the Court of Justice as regards the scope of Directive 2002/58, both the acquisition of data by the security and intelligence agencies from those providers under section 94 of the 1984 Act and the use of that data by those agencies fall within the scope of that directive, whether that data is acquired by means of a transmission carried out in real-time or subsequently. In particular, it argues that the fact that the objective of protecting national security is explicitly listed in Article\u00a015(1) of that directive does not mean that the directive does not apply to such situations, and that assessment is not affected by Article\u00a04(2) TEU.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, the United Kingdom, Czech and Estonian Governments, Ireland, and the French, Cypriot, Hungarian, Polish and Swedish Governments contend, in essence, that Directive 2002/58 does not apply to the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, as the purpose of that legislation is to safeguard national security. They argue that the activities of the security and intelligence agencies are essential State functions relating to the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of national security and territorial integrity, and, accordingly, are the sole responsibility of the Member States, as attested to by, in particular, the third sentence of Article\u00a04(2) TEU.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to those governments, Directive 2002/58 cannot therefore be interpreted as meaning that national measures concerning the safeguarding of national security fall within its scope. Article\u00a01(3) of that directive defines the scope of that directive and excludes from that scope, as was previously provided in the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, activities concerning public security, defence, and State security. Those provisions reflect the allocation of competences laid down in Article\u00a04(2) TEU and would be deprived of any practical effect if it were necessary for measures in the field of national security to meet the requirements of Directive 2002/58. Furthermore, the case-law of the Court derived from the judgment of 30\u00a0May 2006, \nParliament\n v \nCouncil and Commission\n (C-317/04 and C-318/04, EU:C:2006:346), concerning the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46 can be transposed to Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be stated that, under Article\u00a01(1) thereof, Directive 2002/58 provides, inter alia, for the harmonisation of the national provisions required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in particular the right to privacy and confidentiality, with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a01(3) of that directive excludes from its scope \u2018activities of the State\u2019 in specified fields, including activities in areas of criminal law and in the areas of public security, defence and State security, including the economic well-being of the State when the activities relate to State security matters. The activities thus mentioned by way of example are, in any event, activities of the State or of State authorities and are unrelated to fields in which individuals are active (judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788, paragraph\u00a032 and the case-law cited).\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Article\u00a03 of Directive 2002/58 states that the directive is to apply to the processing of personal data in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services in public communications networks in the European Union, including public communications networks supporting data collection and identification devices (\u2018electronic communications services\u2019). Consequently, that directive must be regarded as regulating the activities of the providers of such services (judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788\n, \nparagraph\u00a033 and the case-law cited).\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 states that Member States may adopt, subject to the conditions laid down, \u2018legislative measures to restrict the scope of the rights and obligations provided for in Article\u00a05, Article\u00a06, Article\u00a08(1), (2), (3) and (4), and Article\u00a09 [of that directive]\u2019 (judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a071).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 necessarily presupposes that the national legislative measures referred to therein fall within the scope of that directive, since it expressly authorises the Member States to adopt them only if the conditions laid down in the directive are met. Further, such measures regulate, for the purposes mentioned in that provision, the activity of providers of electronic communications services (judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788\n, \nparagraph\u00a034 and the case-law cited).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is in the light of, inter alia, those considerations that the Court has held that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a03 thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that the scope of that directive extends not only to a legislative measure that requires providers of electronic communications services to retain traffic data and location data, but also to a legislative measure requiring them to grant the competent national authorities access to that data. Such legislative measures necessarily involve the processing, by those providers, of the data and cannot, to the extent that they regulate the activities of those providers, be regarded as activities characteristic of States, referred to in Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58 (see, to that effect, judgment of 2\u00a0October 2018, \nMinisterio Fiscal\n, C-207/16, EU:C:2018:788\n, \nparagraphs\u00a035 and 37 and the case-law cited).\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concerning a legislative measure such as section 94 of the 1984 Act, on the basis of which the competent authority may give the providers of electronic communications services a direction to disclose bulk data to the security and intelligence agencies by transmission, it should be noted that, pursuant to the definition provided in Article\u00a04(2) of Regulation 2016/679, which, according to Article\u00a02 of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a094(2) of that regulation, is applicable, the concept of \u2018the processing of personal data\u2019 designates \u2018any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection,\u00a0\u2026 storage,\u00a0\u2026 consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available\u00a0\u2026\u2019.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the disclosure of personal data by transmission, like the storage or otherwise making available of data, constitutes processing for the purposes of Article\u00a03 of Directive 2002/58 and, accordingly, falls within the scope of that directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 29\u00a0January 2008, \nPromusicae\n, C-275/06, EU:C:2008:54, paragraph\u00a045).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, having regard to the considerations set out in paragraph\u00a038 above and the general scheme of Directive 2002/58, an interpretation of that directive under which the legislative measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) thereof were excluded from the scope of that directive because the objectives which such measures must pursue overlap substantially with the objectives pursued by the activities referred to in Article\u00a01(3) of that same directive would deprive Article\u00a015(1) thereof of any practical effect (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraphs\u00a072 and 73).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concept of \u2018activities\u2019 referred to in Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58 cannot therefore, as was noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in point\u00a075 of his Opinion in Joined Cases \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18 and C-512/18, EU:C:2020:6), to which he makes reference in point\u00a024 of his Opinion in the present case, be interpreted as covering the legislative measures referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of that directive.\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a04(2) TEU, to which the governments listed in paragraph\u00a032 above have made reference, cannot invalidate that conclusion. Indeed, according to the settled case-law of the Court, although it is for the Member States to define their essential security interests and to adopt appropriate measures to ensure their internal and external security, the mere fact that a national measure has been taken for the purpose of protecting national security cannot render EU law inapplicable and exempt the Member States from their obligation to comply with that law (see, to that effect, judgments of 4\u00a0June 2013, \nZZ\n, C-300/11, EU:C:2013:363, paragraph\u00a038 and the case-law cited; of 20\u00a0March 2018, \nCommission\n v \nAustria (State printing office)\n, C-187/16, EU:C:2018:194, paragraphs\u00a075 and 76; and of 2\u00a0April 2020, \nCommission\n v \nPoland, Hungary and Czech Republic (Temporary mechanism for the relocation of applicants for international protection)\n, C-715/17, C-718/17 and C-719/17, EU:C:2020:257, paragraphs\u00a0143 and 170).\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, in the judgment of 30\u00a0May 2006, \nParliament\n v \nCouncil and Commission\n (C-317/04 and C-318/04, EU:C:2006:346, paragraphs\u00a056 to 59), the Court held that the transfer of personal data by airlines to the public authorities of a third country for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorism and other serious crimes did not, pursuant to the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, fall within the scope of that directive, because such a transfer fell within a framework established by the public authorities relating to public security.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, having regard to the findings set out in paragraphs\u00a036, 38 and 39 above, that case-law cannot be transposed to the interpretation of Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58. Indeed, as the Advocate General noted, in essence, in points\u00a070 to 72 of his Opinion in Joined Cases \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n (C-511/18 and C-512/18, EU:C:2020:6), the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, to which that case-law relates, excluded, in a general way, from the scope of that directive \u2018processing operations concerning public security, defence, [and] State security\u2019, without drawing any distinction according to who was carrying out the data processing operation concerned. By contrast, in the context of interpreting Article\u00a01(3) of Directive 2002/58, it is necessary to draw such a distinction. As is apparent from paragraphs\u00a037 to 39 and 42 above, all operations processing personal data carried out by providers of electronic communications services fall within the scope of that directive, including processing operations resulting from obligations imposed on those providers by the public authorities, whereas those processing operations could, where appropriate, on the contrary, fall within the scope of the exception laid down in the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, given the broader wording of that provision, which covers all processing operations concerning public security, defence, or State security, regardless of the person carrying out those operations.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it should be noted that Directive 95/46, which was at issue in the case that gave rise to the judgment of 30\u00a0May 2006, \nParliament\n v \nCouncil and Commission\n (C-317/04 and C-318/04, EU:C:2006:346), has been, pursuant to Article\u00a094(1) of Regulation 2016/679, repealed and replaced by that regulation with effect from 25\u00a0May 2018. Although that regulation states, in Article\u00a02(2)(d) thereof, that it does not apply to processing operations carried out \u2018by competent authorities\u2019 for the purposes of, inter alia, the prevention and detection of criminal offences, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, it is apparent from Article\u00a023(1)(d) and (h) of that regulation that the processing of personal data carried out by individuals for those same purposes falls within the scope of that regulation. It follows that the above interpretation of Article\u00a01(3), Article\u00a03 and Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 is consistent with the definition of the scope of Regulation 2016/679, which is supplemented and specified by that directive.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, where the Member States directly implement measures that derogate from the rule that electronic communications are to be confidential, without imposing processing obligations on providers of electronic communications services, the protection of the data of the persons concerned is not covered by Directive 2002/58, but by national law only, subject to the application of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (OJ 2016 L\u00a0119, p.\u00a089), with the result that the measures in question must comply with, inter alia, national constitutional law and the requirements of the ECHR.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a01(3), Article\u00a03 and Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Article\u00a04(2) TEU, must be interpreted as meaning that national legislation enabling a State authority to require providers of electronic communications services to forward traffic data and location data to the security and intelligence agencies for the purpose of safeguarding national security falls within the scope of that directive.\n\u00a0\nQuestion\u00a02\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Article\u00a04(2) TEU and Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, is to be interpreted as precluding national legislation enabling a State authority to require providers of electronic communications services to carry out the general and indiscriminate transmission of traffic data and location data to the security and intelligence agencies for the purpose of safeguarding national security.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary point, it should be borne in mind that, according to the information set out in the request for a preliminary ruling, section 94 of the 1984 Act permits the Secretary of State to require providers of electronic communications services, by way of directions, if he considers it necessary in the interests of national security or relations with a foreign government, to forward bulk communications data to the security and intelligence agencies. That data includes traffic data and location data, as well as information relating to the services used, pursuant to section 21(4) and (6) of the RIPA. That provision covers, inter alia, the data necessary to (i) identify the source and destination of a communication, (ii) determine the date, time, length and type of communication, (iii) identify the hardware used, and (iv) locate the terminal equipment and the communications. That data includes, inter alia, the name and address of the user, the telephone number of the person making the call and the number called by that person, the IP addresses of the source and addressee of the communication and the addresses of the websites visited.\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such a disclosure of data by transmission concerns all users of means of electronic communication, without its being specified whether that transmission must take place in real-time or subsequently. Once transmitted, that data is, according to the information set out in the request for a preliminary ruling, retained by the security and intelligence agencies and remains available to those agencies for the purposes of their activities, as with the other databases maintained by those agencies. In particular, the data thus acquired, which is subject to bulk automated processing and analysis, may be cross-checked with other databases containing different categories of bulk personal data or be disclosed outside those agencies and to third countries. Lastly, those operations do not require prior authorisation from a court or independent administrative authority and do not involve notifying the persons concerned in any way.\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is apparent from, inter alia, recitals\u00a06 and 7 thereof, the purpose of Directive 2002/58 is to protect users of electronic communications services from risks for their personal data and privacy resulting from new technologies and, in particular, from the increasing capacity for automated storage and processing of data. In particular, that directive seeks, as is stated in recital\u00a02 thereof, to ensure that the rights set out in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter are fully respected. In that regard, it is apparent from the Explanatory Memorandum of the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (COM (2000) 385 final), which gave rise to Directive 2002/58, that the EU legislature sought to \u2018ensure that a high level of protection of personal data and privacy will continue to be guaranteed for all electronic communications services regardless of the technology used\u2019.\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2002/58 provides that \u2018Member States shall ensure the confidentiality of communications and the related traffic data by means of a public communications network and publicly available electronic communications services, through national legislation\u2019. That provision also emphasises that, \u2018in particular, [Member States] shall prohibit listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communications and the related traffic data by persons other than users, without the consent of the users concerned, except when legally authorised to do so in accordance with Article\u00a015(1)\u2019, and specifies that \u2018this paragraph shall not prevent technical storage which is necessary for the conveyance of a communication without prejudice to the principle of confidentiality.\u2019\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, Article\u00a05(1) of that directive enshrines the principle of confidentiality of both electronic communications and the related traffic data and requires, inter alia, that, in principle, persons other than users be prohibited from storing, without those users\u2019 consent, those communications and that data. Having regard to the general nature of its wording, that provision necessarily covers any operation enabling third parties to become aware of communications and data relating thereto for purposes other than the conveyance of a communication.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prohibition on the interception of communications and data relating thereto laid down in Article\u00a05(1) of Directive 2002/58 therefore encompasses any instance of providers of electronic communications services making traffic data and location data available to public authorities, such as the security and intelligence agencies, as well as the retention of that data by those authorities, regardless of how that data is subsequently used.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in adopting that directive, the EU legislature gave concrete expression to the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, so that the users of electronic communications services are entitled to expect, in principle, that their communications and data relating thereto will remain anonymous and may not be recorded, unless they have agreed otherwise (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, paragraph\u00a0109).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 enables the Member States to introduce an exception to the obligation of principle, laid down in Article\u00a05(1) of that directive, to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, and to the corresponding obligations, referred to, inter alia, in Articles\u00a06 and 9 of that directive, where this constitutes a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society to safeguard national security, defence and public security, and the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of unauthorised use of the electronic communication system. To that end, Member States may, inter alia, adopt legislative measures providing for the retention of data for a limited period justified on one of those grounds.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being said, the option to derogate from the rights and obligations laid down in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58 cannot permit the exception to the obligation of principle to ensure the confidentiality of electronic communications and data relating thereto and, in particular, to the prohibition on storage of that data, explicitly laid down in Article\u00a05 of that directive, to become the rule (see judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraphs\u00a089 and 104, and judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, paragraph\u00a0111).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it is apparent from the third sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 that the Member States are not permitted to adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope of the rights and obligations provided for in Articles\u00a05, 6 and 9 of that directive unless they do so in accordance with the general principles of EU law, including the principle of proportionality, and with the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In that regard, the Court has previously held that the obligation imposed on providers of electronic communications services by a Member State by way of national legislation to retain traffic data for the purpose of making it available, if necessary, to the competent national authorities raises issues relating to compatibility not only with Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, relating to the protection of privacy and to the protection of personal data, respectively, but also with Article\u00a011 of the Charter, relating to the freedom of expression (see, to that effect, judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraphs\u00a025 and 70, and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraphs\u00a091 and 92 and the case-law cited).\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those same issues also arise for other types of data processing, such as the transmission of that data to persons other than users or access to that data with a view to its use (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0122 and 123 and the case-law cited).\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the interpretation of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 must take account of the importance both of the right to privacy, guaranteed in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, and of the right to protection of personal data, guaranteed in Article\u00a08 thereof, as derived from the case-law of the Court, as well as the importance of the right to freedom of expression, given that that fundamental right, guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter, constitutes one of the essential foundations of a pluralist, democratic society, and is one of the values on which, under Article\u00a02 TEU, the Union is founded (see, to that effect, judgments of 6\u00a0March 2001, \nConnolly\n v \nCommission\n, C-274/99\u00a0P, EU:C:2001:127, paragraph\u00a039, and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a093 and the case-law cited).\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 of the Charter are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0172 and the case-law cited).\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, as can be seen from Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, that provision allows limitations to be placed on the exercise of those rights, provided that those limitations are provided for by law, that they respect the essence of those rights and that, in compliance with the principle of proportionality, they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be added that the requirement that any limitation on the exercise of fundamental rights must be provided for by law implies that the legal basis which permits the interference with those rights must itself define the scope of the limitation on the exercise of the right concerned ( judgment of 16\u00a0July 2020, \nFacebook Ireland and Schrems\n, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph\u00a0175 and the case-law cited).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concerning observance of the principle of proportionality, the first sentence of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58 provides that the Member States may adopt a measure derogating from the principle that communications and the related traffic data are to be confidential where such a measure is \u2018necessary, appropriate and proportionate\u00a0\u2026 within a democratic society\u2019, in view of the objectives set out in that provision. Recital\u00a011 of that directive specifies that a measure of that nature must be \u2018strictly\u2019 proportionate to the intended purpose.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be borne in mind that the protection of the fundamental right to privacy requires, according to the settled case-law of the Court, that derogations from and limitations on the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. In addition, an objective of general interest may not be pursued without having regard to the fact that it must be reconciled with the fundamental rights affected by the measure, by properly balancing the objective of general interest against the rights at issue (see, to that effect, judgments of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a056; of 9\u00a0November 2010, \nVolker und Markus Schecke and Eifert\n, C-92/09 and C-93/09, EU:C:2010:662, paragraphs\u00a076, 77 and 86; and of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a052; Opinion 1/15 (\nEU-Canada PNR Agreement\n) of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0140).\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to satisfy the requirement of proportionality, the legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose personal data is affected have sufficient guarantees that data will be effectively protected against the risk of abuse. That legislation must be legally binding under domestic law and, in particular, must indicate in what circumstances and under which conditions a measure providing for the processing of such data may be adopted, thereby ensuring that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subjected to automated processing, in particular where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to that data. Those considerations apply especially where the protection of the particular category of personal data that is sensitive data is at stake (see, to that effect, judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraphs\u00a054 and 55, and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0117; Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement) \nof 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0141).\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the question whether national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, meets the requirements of Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, it should be noted that the transmission of traffic data and location data to persons other than users, such as security and intelligence agencies, derogates from the principle of confidentiality. Where that operation is carried out, as in the present case, in a general and indiscriminate way, it has the effect of making the exception to the obligation of principle to ensure the confidentiality of data the rule, whereas the system established by Directive 2002/58 requires that that exception remain an exception.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, in accordance with the settled case-law of the Court, the transmission of traffic data and location data to a third party constitutes interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter, regardless of how that data is subsequently used. In that regard, it does not matter whether the information in question relating to persons\u2019 private lives is sensitive or whether the persons concerned have been inconvenienced in any way on account of that interference (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraphs\u00a0124 and 126 and the case-law cited, and judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, paragraphs\u00a0115 and 116).\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The interference with the right enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter entailed by the transmission of traffic data and location data to the security and intelligence agencies must be regarded as being particularly serious, bearing in mind inter alia the sensitive nature of the information which that data may provide and, in particular, the possibility of establishing a profile of the persons concerned on the basis of that data, such information being no less sensitive than the actual content of communications. In addition, it is likely to generate in the minds of the persons concerned the feeling that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance (see, by analogy, judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraphs\u00a027 and 37, and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraphs\u00a099 and 100).\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that the transmission of traffic data and location data to public authorities for security purposes is liable, in itself, to infringe the right to respect for communications, enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, and to deter users of means of electronic communication from exercising their freedom of expression, guaranteed in Article\u00a011 of the Charter. Such deterrence may affect, in particular, persons whose communications are subject, according to national rules, to the obligation of professional secrecy and whistle-blowers whose actions are protected by Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23\u00a0October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law (OJ 2019 L\u00a0305, p.\u00a017). Moreover, that deterrent effect is all the more serious given the quantity and breadth of the data retained (see, to that effect, judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraph\u00a028; of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0101; and of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, paragraph\u00a0118).\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, given the significant amount of traffic data and location data that can be retained continuously by a general retention measure and the sensitive nature of the information which that data may provide, the mere retention of that data by the providers of electronic communications services entails a risk of abuse and unlawful access.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the objectives that may justify such interferences, and in particular the objective of safeguarding national security, at issue in the main proceedings, it should be noted, at the outset, that Article\u00a04(2) TEU provides that national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State. That responsibility corresponds to the primary interest in protecting the essential functions of the State and the fundamental interests of society and encompasses the prevention and punishment of activities capable of seriously destabilising the fundamental constitutional, political, economic or social structures of a country and, in particular, of directly threatening society, the population or the State itself, such as terrorist activities (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, paragraph\u00a0135).\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The importance of the objective of safeguarding national security, read in the light of Article\u00a04(2) TEU, goes beyond that of the other objectives referred to in Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, inter alia the objectives of combating crime in general, even serious crime, and of safeguarding public security. Threats such as those referred to in paragraph\u00a074 above can be distinguished, by their nature and particular seriousness, from the general risk that tensions or disturbances, even of a serious nature, affecting public security will arise. Subject to meeting the other requirements laid down in Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, the objective of safeguarding national security is therefore capable of justifying measures entailing more serious interferences with fundamental rights than those which might be justified by those other objectives (judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, paragraph\u00a0136).\n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in order to satisfy the requirement of proportionality referred to in paragraph\u00a067 above, according to which derogations from and limitations on the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary, national legislation entailing interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter must meet the requirements stemming from the case-law cited in paragraphs\u00a065, 67 and 68 above.\n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, as regards an authority\u2019s access to personal data, legislation cannot confine itself to requiring that authorities\u2019 access to the data be consistent with the objective pursued by that legislation, but must also lay down the substantive and procedural conditions governing that use (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0192 and the case-law cited).\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, and since general access to all retained data, regardless of whether there is any link, at least indirect, with the aim pursued, cannot be regarded as being limited to what is strictly necessary, national legislation governing access to traffic data and location data must rely on objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which the competent national authorities are to be granted access to the data at issue (see, to that effect, judgment of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0119 and the case-law cited).\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those requirements apply, a fortiori, to a legislative measure, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, on the basis of which the competent national authority may require providers of electronic communications services to disclose traffic data and location data to the security and intelligence agencies by means of general and indiscriminate transmission. Such transmission has the effect of making that data available to the public authorities (see, by analogy, Opinion 1/15 \n(EU-Canada PNR Agreement)\n of 26\u00a0July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph\u00a0212).\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given that the transmission of traffic data and location data is carried out in a general and indiscriminate way, it is comprehensive in that it affects all persons using electronic communications services. It therefore applies even to persons for whom there is no evidence to suggest that their conduct might have a link, even an indirect or remote one, with the objective of safeguarding national security and, in particular, without any relationship being established between the data which is to be transmitted and a threat to national security (see, to that effect, judgments of 8\u00a0April 2014, \nDigital Rights Ireland and Others\n, C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraphs\u00a057 and 58, and of 21\u00a0December 2016, \nTele2\n, C-203/15 and C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph\u00a0105). Having regard to the fact that the transmission of such data to public authorities is equivalent, in accordance with the finding in paragraph\u00a079 above, to access, it must be held that legislation which permits the general and indiscriminate transmission of data to public authorities entails general access.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that national legislation requiring providers of electronic communications services to disclose traffic data and location data to the security and intelligence agencies by means of general and indiscriminate transmission exceeds the limits of what is strictly necessary and cannot be considered to be justified, within a democratic society, as required by Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Article\u00a04(2) TEU and Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter.\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, read in the light of Article\u00a04(2) TEU and Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation enabling a State authority to require providers of electronic communications services to carry out the general and indiscriminate transmission of traffic data and location data to the security and intelligence agencies for the purpose of safeguarding national security.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a01(3), Article\u00a03 and Article\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009, read in the light of Article\u00a04(2) TEU, must be interpreted as meaning that national legislation enabling a State authority to require providers of electronic communications services to forward traffic data and location data to the security and intelligence agencies for the purpose of safeguarding national security falls within the scope of that directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a015(1) of Directive 2002/58, as amended by Directive 2009/136, read in the light of Article\u00a04(2) TEU and Articles\u00a07, 8 and 11 and Article\u00a052(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation enabling a State authority to require providers of electronic communications services to carry out the general and indiscriminate transmission of traffic data and location data to the security and intelligence agencies for the purpose of safeguarding national security.\nLenaerts\nSilva\u00a0de\u00a0Lapuerta\nBonichot\nArabadjiev\nPrechal\nSafjan\nXuereb\nRossi\nMalenovsk\u00fd\nBay\u00a0Larsen\nvon\u00a0Danwitz\nToader\nJ\u00fcrim\u00e4e\nLycourgos\nPi\u00e7arra\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 6 October 2020.\nA.\u00a0Calot Escobar\n\u00a0\nK.

Article\u00a08(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the \u201cCharter\u201d) and Article\u00a016(1) [TFEU] provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data should, whatever their nationality or residence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their right to the protection of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contribute to the accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice and of an economic union, to economic and social progress, to the strengthening and the convergence of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being of natural persons.\n\u2026\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(20)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of courts and other judicial authorities, Union or Member State law could specify the processing operations and processing procedures in relation to the processing of personal data by courts and other judicial authorities.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(26)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information, should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person.\u00a0\u2026 The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.\u00a0\u2026\n\u2026\n(45)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, the processing should have a basis in Union or Member State law.\u00a0\u2026 A law as a basis for several processing operations based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient.

In such a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is required. If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful.\u00a0\u2026 The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing.\u00a0\u2026\nWhere the data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public interest, the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes.

The performance of certain functions dispenses with that obligation if it can be presumed that the person in possession of that document may not be heard as a witness on its content. That exception applies to lawyers, doctors, psychologists, priests and any other person to whom information has been disclosed in confidence in the performance of his or her functions or in similar circumstances. The scope of the said obligation thus corresponds to the obligation to stand as a witness in legal proceedings.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If a person is required to produce a document as evidence, the court may, in accordance with Paragraph\u00a04 of Chapter\u00a038 of the RB, order him or her to do so.\n\u00a0\nThe Law on tax procedures\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Paragraphs\u00a011a to 11c of Chapter 39 of the skattef\u00f6rfarandelagen (2011:1244) [Law (2011:1244) on tax procedures], any person who carries on a construction activity is obliged, in certain cases, to maintain an electronic staff register. That staff register is to document the necessary identification data relating to the persons involved in that economic activity. That obligation is incumbent on the developer, which may, however, delegate it to an independent operator. By virtue of Paragraph\u00a012 of Chapter\u00a039 of that law, the staff register must be made available to the Swedish tax authority.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The data which must be recorded in the staff register are set out in Paragraph\u00a05 of Chapter\u00a09 of the skattef\u00f6rfarandef\u00f6rordningen (2011:1261) [Regulation (2011:1261) on tax procedures]. These include the identity and national identification number of any person involved in the economic activity as well as the start and end times of work.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fastec constructed an office building for Nycander. The persons working on the building site concerned recorded their presence by means of an electronic staff register. That staff register was provided by the company Entral AB, acting on behalf of Fastec.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fastec brought an action before the tingsr\u00e4tt (District Court, Sweden) seeking payment for the works carried out. In that action, Fastec requested Nycander to pay a sum which, according to Fastec, corresponds to the outstanding balance owed by Nycander. The latter company objected to Fastec\u2019s request, claiming, inter alia, that the number of hours worked by Fastec\u2019s staff was lower than that indicated in that request.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before that court, Nycander requested that Entral be ordered to produce Fastec\u2019s staff register for the period from 1\u00a0August 2016 to 30\u00a0November 2017, primarily without redaction, or, in the alternative, with the personal identity numbers of the persons concerned redacted. In support of that request, Nycander claimed that Entral had that staff register in its possession and that it could constitute important evidence for the purposes of ruling on Fastec\u2019s action in so far as the data recorded enabled the hours worked by Fastec\u2019s staff to be proved.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fastec objected to that request, claiming, primarily, that it was contrary to Article\u00a05(1)(b) of the GDPR. It stated that its staff register contains personal data collected in order for checks to be carried out on its activities by the Swedish tax authority, and disclosing those data to the court was not consistent with that objective.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tingsr\u00e4tt (District Court) ordered Entral to produce in an unredacted state Fastec\u2019s staff register for the staff concerned by the building site at issue in the main proceedings during the relevant period. The Svea hovr\u00e4tten (Svea Court of Appeal, Stockholm, Sweden) upheld the decision of the tingsr\u00e4tten (District Court).\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fastec brought an appeal against the decision of the Svea hovr\u00e4tt (Svea Court of Appeal, Stockholm) before the referring court, the H\u00f6gsta domstolen (Supreme Court, Sweden), and asked that Nycander\u2019s request referred to in paragraph\u00a017 above be rejected. \n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court asks whether\u00a0\u2013 and, if so, how\u00a0\u2013 the provisions of the GDPR should be applied in the case in the main proceedings. \n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns the obligation to produce documents, that court observes that it is apparent from its own case-law on the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the RB that it is necessary to weigh up the relevance of the evidence at issue against the opposing party\u2019s interest in not releasing that information. It states that, in the context of that weighing exercise, no account is taken, in principle, of whether the information contained in the document is private in nature or whether other persons have an interest in having access to the content of that document, aside from what may follow from the exceptions specifically provided for by the legislation.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court states that the purpose of the obligation to produce a document laid down by the RB is, inter alia, to give anyone who needs a written document as evidence access to it. In its view, it is ultimately a question of ensuring that individuals are able to exercise their rights where they have a \u2018justified probative interest\u2019.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the H\u00f6gsta domstolen (Supreme Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u20181.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does Article\u00a06(3) and (4) of the GDPR also impose a requirement on national procedural legislation relating to [the obligation to produce documents]?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Question\u00a01 is answered in the affirmative, does the GDPR mean that regard must also be had to the interests of the data subjects when a decision on [production] must be made which involves the processing of personal data? In such circumstances, does EU law establish any requirements concerning how, in detail, that decision should be made?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a06(3) and (4) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that that provision applies, in the context of civil court proceedings, to the production as evidence of a staff register containing personal data of third parties collected principally for the purposes of tax inspection.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to answer that question, it should be noted, in the first place, that Article\u00a02(1) of the GDPR provides that that regulation applies to any \u2018processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system\u2019, without any distinction being made according to the identity of the person who carried out the processing concerned. It follows that, subject to the cases mentioned in Article\u00a02(2) and (3) thereof, the GDPR applies to processing operations carried out both by private persons and by public authorities, including, as recital\u00a020 thereof indicates, judicial authorities, such as courts (judgment of 24\u00a0March 2022, \nAutoriteit Persoonsgegevens\n, C-245/20, EU:C:2022:216, paragraph\u00a025). \n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, according to Article\u00a04(2) of that regulation, the definition of \u2018processing\u2019 of personal data includes any operation which is performed on personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available.\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that a processing operation which falls within the material scope of the GDPR includes not only the creation and maintenance of the electronic staff register (see, by analogy, judgment of 30\u00a0May 2013, \nWorten\n, C-342/12, EU:C:2013:355, paragraph\u00a019), but also the production as evidence of a document, whether digital or physical, containing personal data, ordered by a court in the context of judicial proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 8\u00a0December 2022, \nInspektor v Inspektorata kam Visshia sadeben savet (Purposes of processing personal data)\u00a0\u2013 Criminal investigation)\n, C-180/21, EU:C:2022:967, paragraph\u00a072).\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third place, it must be pointed out that any processing of personal data, including processing carried out by public authorities such as courts, must satisfy the conditions of lawfulness set by Article\u00a06 of the GDPR.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted, first, that, according to Article\u00a06(1)(e) of the GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful if it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article\u00a06(3) of the GDPR, read in combination with recital\u00a045 thereof, the basis for the processing referred to in Article\u00a06(1)(e) of that regulation is to be defined by EU law or by Member State law to which the controller is subject. Moreover, the EU or Member State law must meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The combined provisions of Article\u00a06(1)(e) of the GDPR and Article\u00a06(3) thereof therefore require there to be a legal basis\u00a0\u2013 national in particular\u00a0\u2013 which serves as a basis for the processing of personal data by the relevant controllers acting in the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, such as those performed by courts acting in their judicial capacity.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, where the processing of personal data is carried out for a purpose other than that for which those data have been collected, it follows from Article\u00a06(4) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital\u00a050 thereof, that such processing is allowed provided that it is based, inter alia, on Member State law and that it constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives referred to in Article\u00a023(1) of the GDPR. As that recital indicates, in order to safeguard those important objectives of general public interest, the controller is thus allowed to further process the personal data irrespective of the compatibility of that processing with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case at hand, the relevant provisions of Chapter\u00a038 of the RB, which lay down the obligation to produce a document as evidence and provide for the possibility for national courts to order the production of that document, constitute the legal basis serving as a basis for the processing of personal data. While those provisions constitute, in principle, a sufficient legal basis for allowing the processing of personal data, it is apparent from the order for reference that that legal basis is different from that constituted by the Law on tax procedures, on the basis of which the staff register at issue in the main proceedings was drawn up for the purposes of tax inspection. Moreover, the purpose of the obligation to produce documents laid down by those provisions of the RB is, according to the referring court, to give anyone who needs a written document as evidence access to it. In its view, it is a question of ensuring that individuals are able to exercise their rights where they have a \u2018justified probative interest\u2019.\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to that court, it is apparent from the \ntravaux pr\u00e9paratoires\n that led to the Law on tax procedures that the personal data recorded in the staff register are intended to enable officials of the competent Swedish tax authority to carry out verifications during its on-site inspections. The essential objective is to reduce the occurrence of concealed work and to improve the conditions for competition. The processing of personal data is justified by the need to satisfy the legal obligation on the controller, namely to keep a staff register.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, it must be held that the processing of those data in the context of judicial proceedings such as the main proceedings constitutes processing carried out for a purpose other than that for which the data have been collected, namely for the purposes of tax inspection, and which is not based on the consent of the data subjects, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(1)(a) of the GDPR.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the processing of personal data for a purpose other than that for which those data have been collected must not only be based on national law, such as the provisions of Chapter\u00a038 of the RB, but also constitute a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society, within the meaning of Article\u00a06(4) of the GDPR, and safeguard one of the objectives referred to in Article\u00a023(1) of the GDPR. \n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those objectives include, in accordance with Article\u00a023(1)(f) of that regulation, \u2018the protection of judicial independence and judicial proceedings\u2019, which, as the European Commission noted in its written observations, must be understood as referring to the protection of the administration of justice from internal or external interference, but also to the proper administration of justice. Furthermore, according to Article\u00a023(1)(j) thereof, the enforcement of civil law claims also constitutes an objective which may justify the processing of personal data for a purpose other than that for which they have been collected. It cannot therefore be ruled out that the processing of personal data of third parties in civil court proceedings may be based on such objectives.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, it is for the referring court to ascertain whether the relevant provisions of Chapter\u00a038 of the RB, first, meet one and/or other of those objectives and, second, are necessary and proportionate to the said objectives, so that they are capable of falling within the scope of cases of personal data processing regarded as lawful under the provisions of Article\u00a06(3) and (4) of the GDPR, read in combination with Article\u00a023(1)(f) and (j) thereof. \n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is irrelevant that the processing of personal data is based on a provision of substantive or procedural national law, since the provisions of Article\u00a06(3)(b) and (4) of that regulation make no distinction between those two types of provision.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a06 (3) and (4) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that that provision applies, in the context of civil court proceedings, to the production as evidence of a staff register containing personal data of third parties collected principally for the purposes of tax inspection.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Articles\u00a05 and 6 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, when assessing whether the production of a document containing personal data must be ordered in civil court proceedings, the national court is required to have regard to the interests of the data subjects concerned. If so, that court also asks whether EU law, and the GDPR in particular, lays down any specific requirements as to how that assessment is to be made.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, it must be pointed out that any processing of personal data must, subject to the derogations permitted in Article\u00a023 thereof, observe the principles governing the processing of personal data and the rights of the person concerned set out, respectively, in Chapters II and III of that regulation. In particular, any processing of personal data must, first, comply with the principles set out in Article\u00a05 of that regulation and, second, satisfy the lawfulness conditions listed in Article\u00a06 of the same regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0October 2020, \nLa Quadrature du Net and Others\n, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph\u00a0208 and the case-law cited).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case at hand, the referring court notes that the relevant provisions of Chapter\u00a038 of the RB do not expressly require, during the assessment of whether the production of a document containing personal data must be ordered, regard to be had to the interests of the persons whose personal data are at issue. According to national case-law, those provisions merely require a weighing up of the relevance of the evidence against the opposing party\u2019s interest in not releasing the information at issue.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As has been found in paragraph\u00a039 above, since those national law provisions involve the production of a document as evidence, they are capable of falling within the scope of cases of personal data processing regarded as lawful under the provisions of Article\u00a06(3) and (4) of the GDPR, read in combination with Article\u00a023(1)(f) and (j) thereof. This is so because the said provisions, first, are intended to secure the proper conduct of court proceedings by ensuring that individuals are able to exercise their rights where they have a \u2018justified probative interest\u2019 and, second, are necessary and proportionate to that objective.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from Article\u00a06(4) of the GDPR that such processing of personal data is lawful provided that it constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society and safeguards the objectives referred to in Article\u00a023 of the GDPR which it pursues. Accordingly, in order to verify those requirements, a national court is required to have regard to the opposing interests involved when assessing whether to order the production of a document containing personal data of third parties.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that respect, it is important to stress that the result of the balancing that the national court must carry out may vary according to both the circumstances of each case and the type of proceedings at issue.\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far as concerns the interests involved in civil court proceedings, the national court must, as is apparent in particular from recitals\u00a01 and 2 of the GDPR, guarantee the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, which is a fundamental right enshrined in Article\u00a08(1) of the Charter and in Article\u00a016 TFEU. That court must also guarantee the right to respect for private life, enshrined in Article\u00a07 of the Charter, which is closely linked to the right to the protection of personal data.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as recital\u00a04 of the GDPR states, the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right, but must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, against other fundamental rights, such as the right to effective judicial protection, guaranteed in Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The production of a document containing the personal data of third parties in civil court proceedings contributes, as the Advocate General noted, in essence, in point\u00a061 of her Opinion, to compliance with that right to effective judicial protection.\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, corresponding to Article\u00a06(1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950, its meaning and scope are, in accordance with Article\u00a052(3) of the Charter, the same as those conferred by that convention on that Article\u00a06(1).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the settled case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial, it is essential that an individual have the right to present his or her case effectively before the court and enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 24\u00a0June 2022, \nZayidov v. Azerbaijan (No\u00a02)\n, CE:ECHR:2022:0324JUD000538610, \u00a7\u00a087 and the case-law cited). It follows, inter alia, that an individual must have the benefit of adversarial proceedings and be able to submit, at various stages of those proceedings, the arguments he or she considers relevant to his or her case (ECtHR, 21\u00a0January 1999, \nGarc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain\n, CE:ECHR:1999:0121JUD003054496, \u00a7\u00a029).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in order to ensure that individuals can enjoy a right to effective judicial protection and, in particular, a right to a fair trial, within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article\u00a047 of the Charter, the parties to civil court proceedings must be in a position to access the evidence necessary to establish to the requisite standard the merits of their complaints, which may possibly include personal data of the parties or of third parties. \n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being so, as has been indicated in paragraph\u00a046 above, having regard to the interests involved forms part of the examination of the necessity and proportionality of the measure, which are provided for in Article\u00a06(3) and (4) of the GDPR and which condition the lawfulness of the personal data processing. In that regard, account should therefore also be taken of Article\u00a05(1) thereof, and in particular of the principle of \u2018data minimisation\u2019 set out in Article\u00a05(1)(c), which gives expression to the principle of proportionality. According to that data minimisation principle, personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (see, to that effect, judgment of 22\u00a0June 2021, \nLatvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points)\n, C-439/19, EU:C:2021:504, paragraph\u00a098 and the case-law cited).\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national court is therefore required to determine whether the disclosure of personal data is adequate and relevant for the purpose of attaining the objective pursued by the applicable provisions of national law and whether that objective cannot be achieved by recourse to less intrusive means of proof in respect of the protection of the personal data of a large number of third parties such as, for example, the hearing of selected witnesses. \n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that the production of a document containing personal data proves to be justified, it also follows from that principle that, where only part of those data appears necessary for evidential purposes, the national court must consider taking additional data protection measures, such as the pseudonymisation, defined in Article\u00a04(5) of the GDPR, of the names of the data subjects or any other measure intended to minimise the interference with the right to the protection of personal data resulting from the production of such a document. Such measures may include limiting public access to the file or an order addressed to the parties to whom the documents containing personal data have been disclosed not to use those data for a purpose other than the taking of evidence during the court proceedings at issue.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that it follows from Article\u00a04(5) of the GDPR, read in combination with recital\u00a026 thereof, that pseudonymised personal data which could be attributed to a natural person with the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person, to which the principles of data protection apply. By contrast, it follows from that recital that those principles do not apply \u2018to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable\u2019.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that a national court may take the view that the personal data of the parties or of third parties must be communicated to it in order to be able to balance, in full knowledge of the facts and in compliance with the principle of proportionality, the interests involved. That assessment may, depending on the case, lead it to authorise the full or partial disclosure to the opposing party of the personal data thus communicated to it, if it finds that such disclosure does not go beyond what is necessary for the purpose of guaranteeing the effective enjoyment of the rights which individuals derive from Article\u00a047 of the Charter.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Articles\u00a05 and 6 of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, when assessing whether the production of a document containing personal data must be ordered, the national court is required to have regard to the interests of the data subjects concerned and to balance them according to the circumstances of each case, the type of proceeding at issue and duly taking into account the requirements arising from the principle of proportionality as well as, in particular, those resulting from the principle of data minimisation referred to in Article\u00a05(1)(c) of that regulation.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a06(3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), \nmust be interpreted as meaning that that provision applies, in the context of civil court proceedings, to the production as evidence of a staff register containing personal data of third parties collected principally for the purposes of tax inspection.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticles\u00a05 and 6 of Regulation 2016/679\nmust be interpreted as meaning that when assessing whether the production of a document containing personal data must be ordered, the national court is required to have regard to the interests of the data subjects concerned and to balance them according to the circumstances of each case, the type of proceeding at issue and duly taking into account the requirements arising from the principle of proportionality as well as, in particular, those resulting from the principle of data minimisation referred to in Article\u00a05(1)(c) of that regulation."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

\"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 14 Feb 2019, C-345/17 (\nBuivids\n)\nGeneral data protection law \n >

Directive 95/46, which, according to Article\u00a01 thereof, had the object of protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, notably their right to privacy, with regard to the processing of personal data, and the elimination of obstacles to the free movement of such data, stated in recitals\u00a02, 14, 15, 17, 27 and 37:\n\u2018(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas

developments under way, in the framework of the information society, of the techniques used to capture, transmit, manipulate, record, store or communicate sound and image data relating to natural persons, this Directive should be applicable to processing involving such data;\n(15)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereas the processing of such data is covered by this Directive only if it is

of the Fizisko personu datu aizsardz\u012bbas likums (Personal Data Protection Law) of 23\u00a0March 2000 (\nLatvijas V\u0113stnesis\n, 2000, No\u00a0123/124; \u2018the Personal Data Protection Law\u2019), the purpose of that law is to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their privacy, with regard to the processing of personal data of individuals.\n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Article\u00a02(3) the Personal Data Protection Law, the term \u2018personal data\u2019 is to be taken to mean any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person.\n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a02(4) of that law, the term \u2018processing of personal data\u2019 refers to any operation applied to personal data, including the collection, recording, insertion, storage, organisation, alteration, use, transfer, transmission and dissemination, blocking or deletion of data.\n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03(1) of the Personal Data Protection Law provides that that law, without prejudice to the exceptions provided for in that provision, applies to the processing of every kind of personal data and to every natural or legal person, if:\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the data controller is registered in Latvia;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the data processing is carried out outside the borders of Latvia, in territories belonging to the latter under international

used only for the transmission of personal data via the territory of the Republic of Latvia.\n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a03(3) of that law provides that the latter does not apply to the processing of personal data carried out by natural persons for personal or domestic and family use.\n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a05 of the Personal Data Protection Law, save as otherwise provided, Articles\u00a07 to 9, 11 and 21 of that law are not to apply when the personal data are processed for journalistic purposes in accordance with the Par presi un citiem masu inform\u0101cijas l\u012bdzek\u013ciem likums (Law on the press and other media) or for purposes of artistic or literary expression.\n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a08(1) of the Personal Data Protection Law provides that, when collecting personal data, the data controller is required to provide the

address of the data controller;\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the intended purpose of the processing of the personal data.\n\u00a0\nThe dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling\n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr\u00a0Buivids made a video recording in a station of the Latvian national police while he was making a statement in the context of administrative proceedings which had been brought against him.\n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr\u00a0Buivids published the recorded video (\u2018the video in question\u2019), which showed police officers going about their duties in the police station, on the internet site www.youtube.com, which is an internet site that allows users to publish, share and watch videos.\n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After that video had been published, the National Data Protection Agency found, by decision of 30\u00a0August 2013, that Mr\u00a0Buivids had infringed Article\u00a08(1) of the Personal Data Protection Law because he had not informed the police officers, as persons concerned, in the manner laid down by that provision, of the intended purpose of the processing of personal data concerning them. It is submitted that Mr\u00a0Buivids also failed to provide any information to the National Data Protection Agency as to the purpose of the recording and publication of the recorded video on an internet site such as to prove that the objective pursued was compliant with the provisions of the Personal Data Protection Law. The National Data Protection Agency therefore requested Mr\u00a0Buivids to remove that video from the internet site www.youtube.com and from other websites.\n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr\u00a0Buivids brought an action before the administrat\u012bv\u0101 rajona tiesa (District Administrative Court, Latvia) seeking a declaration that that decision of the National Data Protection Agency was unlawful and claiming compensation for the harm which he claimed to have suffered. Mr\u00a0Buivids stated in his application that he had wished, by the publication of the video in question, to bring to the attention of society something which he considered to constitute unlawful conduct on the part of the police. That court dismissed the action.\n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By judgment of 11\u00a0November 2015, the Administrat\u012bv\u0101 apgabaltiesa (Regional Administrative Court, Latvia) dismissed the appeal brought by Mr\u00a0Buivids against the decision of the administrat\u012bv\u0101 rajona tiesa (District Administrative Court).\n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Administrat\u012bv\u0101 apgabaltiesa (Regional Administrative Court) based its decision on the fact that, in the video in question, it is possible to see police facilities and a number of police officers performing their duties, to hear the conversation with the police officers, which was recorded whilst they were carrying out procedural matters, and to hear the voices of the police officers, Mr\u00a0Buivids and the person accompanying him.\n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, that court held that it was not possible to determine whether Mr\u00a0Buivids\u2019 right to freedom of expression or the right to privacy of other persons had to take precedence, since Mr\u00a0Buivids had not indicated his objective in publishing the video in question. Likewise, the video did not show current events relevant to society or dishonest conduct on the part of the police officers. As Mr\u00a0Buivids had not recorded the video in question for journalistic purposes under the Law on the press and other media, or for purposes of artistic or literary expression, Article\u00a05 of the Personal Data Protection Law was, in that court\u2019s view, not applicable.\n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Administrat\u012bv\u0101 apgabaltiesa (Regional Administrative Court) therefore concluded that\u00a0Mr\u00a0Buivids had infringed Article\u00a08(1) of the Personal Data Protection Law by making a recording of police officers carrying out their duties and by not informing those officers of the specific purpose of the processing of their personal data.\n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr\u00a0Buivids filed an appeal in cassation before the referring court, the Augst\u0101k\u0101 tiesa (Supreme Court, Latvia), against the judgment of the Administrat\u012bv\u0101 apgabaltiesa (Regional Administrative Court), invoking his right to freedom of expression.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr\u00a0Buivids has stated, inter alia, that the video in question shows public officials of the Latvian national police\u00a0\u2013\u2013 namely public persons in a place accessible to the public\u00a0\u2013\u2013 who, on that ground, fall outside the scope of the Personal Data Protection Law.\n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The referring court expresses doubts, first, as to whether the act of filming police officers while they are carrying out their duties in a police station and the act of publishing that recorded video on the internet are matters which come within the scope of Directive 95/46. In that connection, although the referring court considers that Mr\u00a0Buivids\u2019 conduct does not come within the scope of the exceptions to the scope of that directive, as set out in Article\u00a03(2) thereof, that court nevertheless emphasises that the recording at issue in the present case was made only once and that Mr\u00a0Buivids filmed police officers carrying out their public duties, namely whilst they were acting as representatives of the public authorities. Referring to point\u00a095 of the Opinion of Advocate General Bobek in the case \nR\u012bgas satiksme\n (C-13/16, EU:C:2017:43), the referring court maintains that the main concern that justifies the protection of personal data is the risk involved in large-scale processing.\n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, the referring court seeks guidance on the interpretation of the concept \u2018solely for journalistic purposes\u2019 in Article\u00a09 of Directive 95/46, and the question of whether the facts, such as those alleged against Mr\u00a0Buivids, are covered by that concept.\n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, the Augst\u0101k\u0101 tiesa (Supreme Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:\n\u2018(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do activities such as those at issue in the present case, that is to say, the recording, in a police station, of police officers carrying out procedural measures and publication of the video on the internet site www.youtube.com, fall within the scope of Directive 95/46?\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must Directive 95/46 be interpreted as meaning that those activities may be regarded as the processing of personal data for journalistic purposes, within the meaning of Article\u00a09 of Directive [95/46]?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nThe first question\n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a03 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the recording of a video of police officers in a police station, while a statement is being made, and the publication of that video on a video website, on which users can send, watch and share videos, are matters which come within the scope of that directive.\n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that, pursuant to Article\u00a03(1) thereof, Directive 95/46 applies to \u2018the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means, and to the processing otherwise than by automatic means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system\u2019.\n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concept of \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of that provision encompasses, according to the definition in Article\u00a02(a) of that directive, \u2018any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\u2019. An identifiable person is \u2018one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to \u2026 one or more factors specific to his physical \u2026 identity\u2019.\n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the case-law of the Court, the image of a person recorded by a camera constitutes \u2018personal data\u2019 within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46 inasmuch as it makes it possible to identify the person concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 11\u00a0December 2014, \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraph\u00a022).\n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that it is possible to see and hear the police officers in the video in question, with the result that it must be held that those recorded images of persons constitute personal data within the meaning of Article\u00a02(a) of Directive 95/46.\n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the concept of the \u2018processing of personal data\u2019, this is defined in Article\u00a02(b) of Directive 95/46 as \u2018any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data \u2026 such as collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction\u2019.\n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the context of a video-surveillance system, the Court has held that a video recording of persons which is stored on a continuous recording device\u00a0\u2014 the hard disk drive of that system\u00a0\u2014 constitutes, pursuant to Article\u00a02(b) and Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 95/46, the automatic processing of personal data (see, to that effect, judgment of 11\u00a0December 2014, \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraphs\u00a023 and 25).\n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the hearing before the Court of Justice, Mr\u00a0Buivids stated that he had used a digital photo camera to record the video in question. This is a video recording of persons which is stored on a continuous recording device, namely the memory of that camera. Thus, such a recording constitutes a processing of personal data by automatic means within the meaning of Article\u00a03(1) of that directive.\n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, the fact that such a recording was made on only one occasion has no bearing on the issue of whether that operation comes within the scope of Directive 95/46. As is apparent from the wording of Article\u00a02(b) of that directive, read in conjunction with Article\u00a03(1) thereof, that directive applies to \u2018any operation\u2019 which constitutes the processing of personal data within the meaning of those provisions.\n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has held that the operation of loading personal data onto an internet page must be regarded as constituting such processing (see, to that effect, judgments of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a025, and of 13\u00a0May 2014, \nGoogle Spain and Google\n, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph\u00a026).\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, the Court has also specified that placing information on an internet page entails the operation of loading that page onto a server and the operations necessary to make that page accessible to people who are connected to the internet. Such operations are performed, at least in part, automatically (see, to that effect, judgment of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a026).\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it must be held that the act of publishing a video recording, such as the video in question, which contains personal data, on a video website on which users can send, watch and share videos, constitutes processing of those data wholly or partly by automatic means, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(b) and Article\u00a03(1) of Directive 95/46.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in accordance with Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46, the latter does not apply to two types of processing of personal data. The first of these is the processing of data for the exercise of an activity which falls outside the scope of EU law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union, in its version prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and in any event processing operations which concern public security, defence, State security and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law. Secondly, that provision excludes the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so far as they render inapplicable the system of protection of personal data provided for in Directive 95/46 and thus deviate from the objective underlying it, namely to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, such as the right to respect for private and family life and the right to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles\u00a07 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018the Charter\u2019), the exceptions provided for in Article\u00a03(2) of that directive must be interpreted strictly (see, to that effect, judgments of 27\u00a0September 2017, \nPu\u0161k\u00e1r\n, C-73/16, EU:C:2017:725, paragraph\u00a038, and of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a037).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the main proceedings, it is apparent from the information submitted to the Court that, first, the recording and publication of the video in question cannot be regarded as a processing of personal data in the exercise of an activity which falls outside the scope of EU law, nor can it be understood as a processing operation which concerns public security, defence, State security and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law, within the meaning of the first indent of Article\u00a03(2) of Directive 95/46. In that regard, the Court has held that the activities which are mentioned by way of example in that article are, in any event, activities of the State or of State authorities unrelated to the fields of activity of individuals (see, to that effect, judgment of 27\u00a0September 2017, \nPu\u0161k\u00e1r\n, C-73/16, EU:C:2017:725, paragraph\u00a036 and the case-law cited).\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, since Mr\u00a0Buivids published the video in question on a video website on which users can send, watch and share videos, without restricting access to that video, thereby permitting access to personal data to an indefinite number of people, the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings does not come within the context of purely personal or household activities (see, by analogy, judgments of 6\u00a0November 2003, \nLindqvist\n, C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, paragraph\u00a047; of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a044; of 11\u00a0December 2014, \nRyne\u0161\n, C-212/13, EU:C:2014:2428, paragraphs\u00a031 and 33; and of 10\u00a0July 2018, \nJehovan todistajat\n, C-25/17, EU:C:2018:551, paragraph\u00a042).\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the act of recording a video of police officers in the performance of their duties is not capable of excluding such a type of processing of personal data from coming within the scope of Directive 95/46.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General observes in point\u00a029 of her Opinion, that directive contains no express exception which excludes the processing of personal data of public officials from its scope.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it is apparent from the Court\u2019s case-law that the fact that information is provided as part of a professional activity does not mean that it cannot be characterised as \u2018personal data\u2019 (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0July 2015, \nClientEarth and PAN Europe \nv\n EFSA\n, C-615/13\u00a0P, EU:C:2015:489, paragraph\u00a030 and the case-law cited).\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Article\u00a03 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that the recording of a video of police officers in a police station, while a statement is being made, and the publication of that video on a video website, on which users can send, watch and share videos, are matters which come within the scope of that directive.\n\u00a0\nThe second question\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a09 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that factual circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, that is to say, the recording of a video of police officers in a police station, while a statement is being made, and the publication of that recorded video on a video website, on which users can send, watch and share videos, constitute processing of personal data for journalistic purposes, within the meaning of that provision.\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be observed, as a preliminary point, that, according to settled case-law of the Court, the provisions of a directive must be interpreted in the light of the aims pursued by the directive and the system which it establishes (judgment of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a051 and the case-law cited).\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it is apparent from Article\u00a01 of Directive 95/46 that its objective is that the Member States should, while permitting the free flow of personal data, protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data. That objective cannot, however, be pursued without having regard to the fact that those fundamental rights must, to some degree, be reconciled with the fundamental right to freedom of expression. Recital\u00a037 of Directive 95/46 makes it clear that Article\u00a09 seeks to reconcile two fundamental rights: the protection of privacy and freedom of expression. This is a task for the Member States (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraphs\u00a052 to 54).\n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already held that, in order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society, it is necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a056).\n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it is apparent from the legislative history of Directive 95/46 that the exemptions and derogations provided for in Article\u00a09 of that directive apply not only to media undertakings but also to every person engaged in journalism (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a058).\n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the Court\u2019s case-law that \u2018journalistic activities\u2019 are those which have as their purpose the disclosure to the public of information, opinions or ideas, irrespective of the medium which is used to transmit them (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a061).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although it is for the referring court to determine whether, in the present case, the processing of personal data by Mr\u00a0Buivids serves that objective, the fact remains that the Court may provide the referring court with the elements of interpretation which are necessary for its assessment.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, having regard to the case-law of the Court cited in paragraphs\u00a052 and 53 of the present judgment, the fact that Mr\u00a0Buivids is not a professional journalist does not appear to be capable of excluding the possibility that the recording of the video in question and its publication on a video website, on which users can send, watch and share videos, may come within the scope of that provision.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the fact that Mr\u00a0Buivids uploaded the recorded video online on such an internet site, in this case www.youtube.com, cannot in itself preclude the classification of that processing of personal data as having been carried out \u2018solely for journalistic purposes\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a09 of Directive 95/46.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Account must be taken of the evolution and proliferation of methods of communication and the dissemination of information. Thus, the Court has already held that the medium which is used to transmit the processed data, whether it be classic in nature, such as paper or radio waves, or electronic, such as the internet, is not determinative as to whether an activity is undertaken \u2018solely for journalistic purposes\u2019 (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a060).\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, as observed, in essence, by the Advocate General in point\u00a055 of her Opinion, the view cannot be taken that all information published on the internet, involving personal data, comes under the concept of \u2018journalistic activities\u2019 and thus benefits from the exemptions or derogations provided for in Article\u00a09 of Directive 95/46.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is for the referring court to determine whether it appears from the video in question that the sole purpose of the recording and publication of the video was the disclosure to the public of information, opinions or ideas (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a062).\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that end, the referring court may, in particular, take into consideration the fact that, according to Mr\u00a0Buivids, the video in question was published on an internet site to draw to the attention of society alleged police malpractice which, he claims, occurred while he was making his statement.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted, however, that the establishment of such malpractice is not a condition for the applicability of Article\u00a09 of Directive 95/46.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, should it transpire that the recording and publication of the video were not intended solely to disclose information, opinions or ideas to the public, it cannot be held that the processing of the personal data at issue was carried out \u2018solely for journalistic purposes\u2019.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that the exemptions and derogations in Article\u00a09 of Directive 95/46 must be applied only where they are necessary in order to reconcile two fundamental rights, namely the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a055).\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in order to achieve a balance between those two fundamental rights, the protection of the fundamental right to privacy requires that the derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data provided for in Chapters II, IV and VI of Directive 95/46 must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (see, to that effect, judgment of 16\u00a0December 2008, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi and Satamedia\n, C-73/07, EU:C:2008:727, paragraph\u00a056).\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that Article\u00a07 of the Charter, concerning the right to respect for private and family life, contains rights which correspond to those guaranteed by Article\u00a08(1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed at Rome on 4\u00a0November 1950, (\u2018the ECHR\u2019) and that, in accordance with Article\u00a052(3) of the Charter, Article\u00a07 thereof is thus to be given the same meaning and the same scope as Article\u00a08(1) ECHR, as interpreted by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (judgment of 17\u00a0December 2015, \nWebMindLicenses\n, C-419/14, EU:C:2015:832, paragraph\u00a070). The same is true of Article\u00a011 of the Charter and Article\u00a010 ECHR (see, to that effect, judgment of 4\u00a0May 2016, \nPhilip Morris Brands and Others\n, C-547/14, EU:C:2016:325, paragraph\u00a0147).\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that connection, it is apparent from that case-law that, in order to balance the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression, the European Court of Human Rights has laid down a number of relevant criteria which must be taken into account, inter alia, contribution to a debate of public interest, the degree of notoriety of the person affected, the subject of the news report, the prior conduct of the person concerned, the content, form and consequences of the publication, and the manner and circumstances in which the information was obtained and its veracity (see, to that effect, judgment of the ECtHR of 27\u00a0June 2017, \nSatakunnan Markkinap\u00f6rssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v. Finland\n, CE:ECHR:2017:0627JUD000093113, \u00a7 165) Similarly, the possibility for the controller to adopt measures to mitigate the extent of the interference with the right to privacy must be taken into account.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, it is apparent from the documents submitted to the Court that it cannot be ruled out that the recording and publication of the video in question, which took place without the persons concerned being informed of the recording and its purposes, constitutes an interference with the fundamental right to privacy of those persons, namely the police officers featured in that video.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If it should transpire that the sole objective of the recording and publication of the video in question was the disclosure to the public of information, opinions or ideas, it is for the referring court to determine whether the exemptions or derogations provided for in Article\u00a09 of Directive 95/46 are necessary in order to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression, and whether those exemptions and derogations are applied only in so far as is strictly necessary.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article\u00a09 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that factual circumstances such as those of the case in the main proceedings, that is to say, the video recording of police officers in a police station, while a statement is being made, and the publication of that recorded video on a video website, on which users can send, watch and share videos, may constitute a processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes, within the meaning of that provision, in so far as it is apparent from that video that the sole object of that recording and publication thereof is the disclosure of information, opinions or ideas to the public, this being a matter which it is for the referring court to determine.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a03 of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be interpreted as meaning that the recording of a video of police officers in a police station, while a statement is being made, and the publication of that video on a video website, on which users can send, watch and share videos, are matters which come within the scope of that directive.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a09 of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as meaning that factual circumstances such as those of the case in the main proceedings, that is to say, the video recording of police officers in a police station, while a statement is being made, and the publication of that recorded video on a video website, on which users can send, watch and share videos, may constitute a processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes, within the meaning of that provision, in so far as it is apparent from that video that the sole object of that recording and publication thereof is the disclosure of information, opinions or ideas to the public, this being a matter which it is for the referring court to determine."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}

The goal is for her to be able to see if the cases is relevant within 30 seconds.\n\nDo a summary in the format of the following example. The case to summarize is provided below.\n\nImportant Factors for Quick Relevance Assessment:\n\n    Legal Issues: Key legal principles and interpretations involved.\n    Facts: Core facts that underpin the legal issues.\n    Judgment: Court's final decision and its implications.\n    Applicable Law: Specific provisions of the law applied.\n    Reasoning: Court's rationale in arriving at its decision.\n    Impact: Potential implications for future cases or practices.\n\nEXAMPLE - Concise Summary:\nCase Overview:\n\n    Case Name: IAB Europe v. Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit\n    Court: Fourth Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    Date: 7 March 2024\n    Reference: C-604/22\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n    Interpretation of \"personal data\" (Article 4(1) GDPR)\n    Definition of \"data controller\" (Article 4(7) GDPR)\n    Concept of \"joint controllers\" (Article 26(1) GDPR)\n\nCore Facts:\n\n    IAB Europe, a non-profit in the digital advertising sector, created the Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) to help its members comply with GDPR.\n    TCF includes guidelines for obtaining user consent for data processing, which is recorded in a Transparency and Consent String (TC String).\n    The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) found IAB Europe as a controller of the TC String data and ordered compliance with GDPR, along with fines.\n\nJudgment:\n\n    TC String as Personal Data:\n        The TC String, containing user consent preferences, is considered personal data if it can be associated with an identifier like an IP address.\n        This applies even if IAB Europe cannot directly access or combine the TC String with other identifiers.\n\n    IAB Europe as Joint Controller:\n        IAB Europe is a joint controller because it influences the processing of personal data through its TCF, setting binding technical rules.\n        This status holds despite IAB Europe not having direct access to the personal data processed by its members.\n\n    Scope of Joint Controllership:\n        IAB Europe\u2019s joint controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent processing by third parties (e.g., for targeted advertising) unless it has a direct role in determining the purposes and means of such processing.\n\nApplicable Law:\n\n    GDPR Articles: 4(1), 4(7), 6(1)(f), 24(1), 26(1)\n    EU Charter: Articles 7 and 8\n    Recitals of GDPR: 1, 10, 26, 30\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Personal Data Definition: Emphasizes the broad scope intended by the GDPR.\n    Controller Definition: Focuses on the influence over purposes and means of processing.\n    Joint Controllership: Considers both direct and indirect influence over data processing operations.\n\nImpact:\n\n    Clarifies the scope of what constitutes personal data under GDPR.\n    Defines the responsibilities and scope of control for organizations setting data processing frameworks.\n    Establishes limits on the extension of joint controllership to subsequent data processing activities.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Judgment of 1 Oct 2019, C-673/17 (\nPlanet49\n)\nE-privacy Directive \n > \nCookies

Beneath the input fields for the address were two bodies of explanatory text accompanied by checkboxes. The first body of text with a checkbox without a preselected tick (\u2018the first checkbox\u2019) read:\n\u2018I agree to certain \nsponsors and cooperation partners\n providing me with information by post or by telephone or by email/SMS about offers from their \nrespective commercial sectors\n.

The underlined word \u2018Unsubscribe\u2019 was contained after the name of each company. The following statement preceded the list:\n\u2018By clicking on the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link, I am deciding that no advertising consent is permitted to be granted to the partner/sponsor in question.

Does this include the duration of the operation of the cookies and the question of whether third parties are given access to the cookies?\u2019\n\u00a0\nConsideration of the questions referred\n\u00a0\nPreliminary observations\n38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary matter, it is appropriate to consider the applicability of Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679 to the facts at issue in the main proceedings.\n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Article\u00a094(1) of Regulation 2016/679, Directive 95/46 was repealed and replaced by that regulation with effect from 25\u00a0May 2018.\n40\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, that date is more recent than the date of the last hearing before the referring court, which took place on 14\u00a0July 2017, and more recent than the date on which the request for a preliminary ruling was referred by the national court.\n41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the referring court stated that, in view of the entry into force, on 25\u00a0May 2018, of Regulation 2016/679, to which part of the first question refers, it was likely that that regulation would need to be taken into account when disposing of the case in the main proceedings. In addition, as the German Government stated at the hearing before the Court, it is not inconceivable that, in so far as the proceedings brought by the Federation seek an order that Planet49 refrain from future action, Regulation 2016/679 would be applicable \nratione temporis\n to the case in the main proceedings according to the national case-law regarding the relevant legal position on injunctions, which is for the referring court to ascertain (see, as regards an action for a declaratory judgment, judgment of 16\u00a0January 2019, \nDeutsche Post\n, C-496/17, EU:C:2019:26, paragraph\u00a038).\n42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In those circumstances, and in the light of the fact that, under Article\u00a094(2) of Regulation 2016/679, the references to Directive 95/46 in Directive 2002/58 are to be construed as references to that regulation, it is not inconceivable, in the present case, that Directive 2002/58 applies both to Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679, according to the nature of the Federation\u2019s pleas and the relevant time.\n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The questions referred must therefore be answered having regard to both Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 1(a) and (c)\n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 1(a) and (c), the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a02(f) and Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a06(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, must be interpreted as meaning that the consent referred to in those provisions is validly constituted if, in the form of cookies, the storage of information or access to information already stored in a website user\u2019s terminal equipment is permitted by way of a pre-checked checkbox which the user must deselect to refuse his or her consent.\n45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary matter, it is important to note that, according to the order for reference, the cookies likely to be placed on the terminal equipment of a user participating in the promotional lottery organised by Planet49 contain a number which is assigned to the registration data of that user, who must enter his or her name and address in the registration form for the lottery. The referring court adds that, by linking that number with that data, a connection between a person to the data stored by the cookies arises if the user uses the internet, such that the collection of that data by means of cookies is a form of processing of personal data. Those statements were confirmed by Planet49, which noted in its written observations that the consent to which the second checkbox refers is intended to authorise the collection and processing of personal data, not anonymous data.\n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the basis of those explanations, it should be noted that, in accordance with Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58, Member States are to ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a user is only allowed on condition that the user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information, in accordance with Directive 95/46, inter alia, about the purposes of the processing.\n47\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be noted that, the need for a uniform application of EU law and the principle of equality require that the wording of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union (judgments of 26\u00a0March 2019, \nSM (Child placed under Algerian kafala)\n, C-129/18, EU:C:2019:248, paragraph\u00a050, and of 11\u00a0April 2019, \nTarola\n, C-483/17, EU:C:2019:309, paragraph\u00a036).\n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, according to settled case-law of the Court, the interpretation of a provision of EU law requires that account be taken not only of its wording and the objectives it pursues, but also of its legislative context and the provisions of EU law as a whole. The origins of a provision of EU law may also provide information relevant to its interpretation (judgment of 10\u00a0December 2018, \nWightman and Others\n, C-621/18, EU:C:2018:999, paragraph\u00a047 and the case-law cited).\n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the wording of Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58, it should be made clear that, although that provision states expressly that the user must have \u2018given his or her consent\u2019 to the storage of and access to cookies on his or her terminal equipment, that provision does not, by contrast, indicate the way in which that consent must be given. The wording \u2018given his or her consent\u2019 does, however, lend itself to a literal interpretation according to which action is required on the part of the user in order to give his or her consent. In that regard, it is clear from recital 17 of Directive 2002/58 that, for the purposes of that directive, a user\u2019s consent may be given by any appropriate method enabling a freely given specific and informed indication of the user\u2019s wishes, including \u2018by ticking a box when visiting an internet website\u2019.\n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the legislative context of which Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58 forms a part, Article\u00a02(f) of that directive, which defines \u2018consent\u2019, for the purposes thereof, refers, in that regard, to the \u2018data subject\u2019s consent\u2019 set out in Directive 95/46. Recital 17 of Directive 2002/58 states that, for the purposes of that directive, consent of a user should have the same meaning as the data subject\u2019s consent as defined and further specified in Directive 95/46. \n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 defines \u2018the data subject\u2019s consent\u2019 as being \u2018any freely given specific and informed indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed\u2019. \n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, as the Advocate General stated in point\u00a060 of his Opinion, the requirement of an \u2018indication\u2019 of the data subject\u2019s wishes clearly points to active, rather than passive, behaviour. However, consent given in the form of a preselected tick in a checkbox does not imply active behaviour on the part of a website user. \n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is borne out by Article\u00a07 of Directive 95/46, which sets out an exhaustive list of cases in which the processing of personal data can be regarded as lawful (see, to that effect, judgments of 24\u00a0November 2011, \nAsociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Establecimientos Financieros de Cr\u00e9dito\n, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, paragraph\u00a030, and of 19\u00a0October 2016, \nBreyer\n, C-582/14, EU:C:2016:779, paragraph\u00a057).\n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, Article\u00a07(a) of Directive 95/46 provides that the data subject\u2019s consent may make such processing lawful provided that the data subject has given his or her consent \u2018unambiguously\u2019. Only active behaviour on the part of the data subject with a view to giving his or her consent may fulfil that requirement.\n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it would appear impossible in practice to ascertain objectively whether a website user had actually given his or her consent to the processing of his or her personal data by not deselecting a pre-ticked checkbox nor, in any event, whether that consent had been informed. It is not inconceivable that a user would not have read the information accompanying the preselected checkbox, or even would not have noticed that checkbox, before continuing with his or her activity on the website visited.\n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, as regards the origins of Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58, the initial wording of that provision provided only for the requirement that the user had the \u2018right to refuse\u2019 the storage of cookies, after having received, pursuant to Directive 95/46, clear and comprehensive information, inter alia, regarding the purpose of the data processing. Directive 2009/136 introduced a substantive amendment to the wording of that provision, by replacing that wording with \u2018given his or her consent\u2019. The legislative origins of Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58 thus seem to indicate that henceforth user consent may no longer be presumed but must be the result of active behaviour on the part of the user.\n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards the foregoing, the consent referred to in Article\u00a02(f) and Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46, is therefore not validly constituted if the storage of information, or access to information already stored in an website user\u2019s terminal equipment, is permitted by way of a checkbox pre-ticked by the service provider which the user must deselect to refuse his or her consent.\n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be added that the indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes referred to in Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 must, inter alia, be \u2018specific\u2019 in the sense that it must relate specifically to the processing of the data in question and cannot be inferred from an indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes for other purposes.\n59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, contrary to what Planet49 claims, the fact that a user selects the button to participate in the promotional lottery organised by that company cannot therefore be sufficient for it to be concluded that the user validly gave his or her consent to the storage of cookies.\n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A fortiori, the preceding interpretation applies in the light of Regulation 2016/679.\n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General stated, in essence, in point\u00a070 of his Opinion, the wording of Article\u00a04(11) of Regulation 2016/679, which defines the \u2018data subject\u2019s consent\u2019 for the purposes of that regulation and, in particular, of Article\u00a06(1)(a) thereof, to which Question 1(c) refers, appears even more stringent than that of Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 in that it requires a \u2018freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous\u2019 indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes in the form of a statement or of \u2018clear affirmative action\u2019 signifying agreement to the processing of the personal data relating to him or her.\n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Active consent is thus now expressly laid down in Regulation 2016/679. It should be noted in that regard that, according to recital 32 thereof, giving consent could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website. On the other hand, that recital expressly precludes \u2018silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity\u2019 from constituting consent.\n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows that the consent referred to in Article\u00a02(f) and in Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a04(11) and Article\u00a06(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, is not validly constituted if the storage of information, or access to information already stored in the website user\u2019s terminal equipment, is permitted by way of a pre-ticked checkbox which the user must deselect to refuse his or her consent.\n64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, it should be noted that the referring court has not referred to the Court the question whether it is compatible with the requirement that consent be \u2018freely given\u2019, within the meaning of Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 and of Article\u00a04(11) and Article\u00a07(4) of Regulation 2016/679, for a user\u2019s consent to the processing of his personal data for advertising purposes to be a prerequisite to that user\u2019s participation in a promotional lottery, as appears to be the case in the main proceedings, according to the order for reference, at least as far as concerns the first checkbox. In those circumstances, it is not appropriate for the Court to consider that question.\n65\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to Question 1(a) and (c) is that Article\u00a02(f) and Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04(11) and Article\u00a06(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, must be interpreted as meaning that the consent referred to in those provisions is not validly constituted if, in the form of cookies, the storage of information or access to information already stored in a website user\u2019s terminal equipment is permitted by way of a pre-checked checkbox which the user must deselect to refuse his or her consent.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 1(b)\n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 1(b), the referring court wishes to know, in essence, whether Article\u00a02(f) and Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a06(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, must be interpreted differently according to whether or not the information stored or accessed on a website user\u2019s terminal equipment is personal data within the meaning of Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679.\n67\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As stated in paragraph\u00a045 above, according to the order for reference, the storage of cookies at issue in the main proceedings amounts to a processing of personal data.\n68\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That being the case, the Court notes, in any event, that Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58 refers to \u2018the storing of information\u2019 and \u2018the gaining of access to information already stored\u2019, without characterising that information or specifying that it must be personal data.\n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General stated in point\u00a0107 of his Opinion, that provision aims to protect the user from interference with his or her private sphere, regardless of whether or not that interference involves personal data.\n70\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is borne out by recital 24 of Directive 2002/58, according to which any information stored in the terminal equipment of users of electronic communications networks are part of the private sphere of the users requiring protection under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. That protection applies to any information stored in such terminal equipment, regardless of whether or not it is personal data, and is intended, in particular, as is clear from that recital, to protect users from the risk that hidden identifiers and other similar devices enter those users\u2019 terminal equipment without their knowledge.\n71\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to Question 1(b) is that Article\u00a02(f) and Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04(11) and Article\u00a06(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, are not to be interpreted differently according to whether or not the information stored or accessed on a website user\u2019s terminal equipment is personal data within the meaning of Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679.\n\u00a0\nQuestion 2\n72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By Question 2, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58 must be interpreted as meaning that the information that the service provider must give to a website user includes the duration of the operation of cookies and whether or not third parties may have access to those cookies.\n73\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As has already been made clear in paragraph\u00a046 above, Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58 requires that the user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information, \u2018in accordance with Directive [95/46]\u2019, inter alia, about the purposes of the processing.\n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Advocate General stated in point\u00a0115 of his Opinion, clear and comprehensive information implies that a user is in a position to be able to determine easily the consequences of any consent he or she might give and ensure that the consent given is well informed. It must be clearly comprehensible and sufficiently detailed so as to enable the user to comprehend the functioning of the cookies employed.\n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which, according to the file before the Court, cookies aim to collect information for advertising purposes relating to the products of partners of the organiser of the promotional lottery, the duration of the operation of the cookies and whether or not third parties may have access to those cookies form part of the clear and comprehensive information which must be provided to the user in accordance with Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58. \n76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, it should be made clear that Article\u00a010 of Directive 95/46, to which Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58 and Article\u00a013 of Regulation 2016/679 refer, lists the information with which the controller must provide a data subject from whom data relating to himself are collected. \n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That information includes, inter alia, under Article\u00a010 of Directive 95/46, in addition to the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the data are intended, any further information such as the recipients or categories of recipients of the data in so far as such further information is necessary, having regard to the specific circumstances in which the data are processed, to guarantee fair processing in respect of the data subject.\n78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the duration of the processing of the data is not included as part of that information, it is, however, clear from the words \u2018at least\u2019 in Article\u00a010 of Directive 95/46 that that information is not listed exhaustively. Information on the duration of the operation of cookies must be regarded as meeting the requirement of fair data processing provided for in that article in that, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, a long, or even unlimited, duration means collecting a large amount of information on users\u2019 surfing behaviour and how often they may visit the websites of the organiser of the promotional lottery\u2019s advertising partners.\n79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation is borne out by Article\u00a013(2)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, which provides that the controller must, in order to ensure fair and transparent processing, provide the data subject with information relating, inter alia, to the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, to the criteria used to determine that period.\n80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to whether or not third parties may have access to cookies, that is information included within the information referred to in Article\u00a010(c) of Directive 95/46 and in Article\u00a013(1)(e) of Regulation 2016/679, since those provisions expressly refer to the recipients or categories of recipients of the data.\n81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to Question 2 is that Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58 must be interpreted as meaning that the information that the service provider must give to a website user includes the duration of the operation of cookies and whether or not third parties may have access to those cookies.\n\u00a0\nCosts\n82\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(f) and of Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12\u00a0July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25\u00a0November 2009, read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24\u00a0October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and Article\u00a04(11) and Article\u00a06(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27\u00a0April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46 (General Data Protection Regulation), must be interpreted as meaning that the consent referred to in those provisions is not validly constituted if, in the form of cookies, the storage of information or access to information already stored in a website user\u2019s terminal equipment is permitted by way of a pre-checked checkbox which the user must deselect to refuse his or her consent.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a02(f) and Article\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58, as amended by Directive 2009/136, read in conjunction with Article\u00a02(h) of Directive 95/46 and Article\u00a04(11) and Article\u00a06(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, are not to be interpreted differently according to whether or not the information stored or accessed on a website user\u2019s terminal equipment is personal data within the meaning of Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nArticle\u00a05(3) of Directive 2002/58, as amended by Directive 2009/136, must be interpreted as meaning that the information that the service provider must give to a website user includes the duration of the operation of cookies and whether or not third parties may have access to those cookies."}], "max_tokens": 4096}}
