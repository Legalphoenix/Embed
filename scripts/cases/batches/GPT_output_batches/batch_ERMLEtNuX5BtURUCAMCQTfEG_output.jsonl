Bundesrepublik Deutschland\n    **Court:** Second Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n    **Date:** 19 October 2016\n    **Reference:** C-582/14\n\n**Key Legal Issues:**\n\n    **Interpretation of 'personal data'** (Directive 95/46/EC, Article 2(a))\n    **Legitimate interests in data processing** (Directive 95/46/EC, Article 7(f))\n    **Exemptions related to public security** (Directive 95/46/EC, Article 3(2))\n\n**Core Facts:**\n\n    Patrick Breyer accessed websites operated by German Federal institutions which stored his dynamic IP address to prevent cyber-attacks.\n    Breyer contested this storage without his specific consent.\n\n**Judgment:**\n\n    **Dynamic IP Address as Personal Data:**\n        Dynamic IP addresses, when combined with other data possessed by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), are personal data if the website provider has legal means to obtain the additional data to identify the user.\n    \n    **National Law and Legitimate Interests:**\n        National law (TMG) must not prevent the balancing of legitimate interests against the protection of user data. Member States' legislation cannot categorically restrict data processing necessary for ensuring general operability of services.\n\n**Applicable Law:**\n\n    **Directive 95/46/EC:** Articles 2(a), 3(2), 7(f)\n    **Recital:** 26\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n    **Personal Data Definition:** Included data that does not directly identify an individual but allows identification by combining separate data.\n    **Legitimate Interests:** National laws should not impose stricter conditions than those outlined under Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46, which permits data processing essential for legitimate interests unless overridden by the individual's rights.\n    **EU Legal Framework:** Maintains that balance is required between data protection and the free movement of data.\n\n**Impact:**\n\n    Clarifies that dynamic IP addresses can be classified as personal data under EU law if they can reasonably facilitate user identification.\n    Establishes that Member States cannot implement overly restrictive laws that prevent the processing of data necessary for maintaining the security and operability of services."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 8470, "completion_tokens": 468, "total_tokens": 8938}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_319be4768e"}}, "error": null}
